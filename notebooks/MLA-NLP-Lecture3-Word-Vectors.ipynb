    "Word vectors refers to a family of related techniques, first gaining popularity via ```Word2Vec``` which associates an $n$-dimensional (normally $n$ is in the range of $50$ to $500$.  For us it will be $300$) vector to every word in the target language.\n",

    "We will first load a batch of word vectors known as [ConceptNet Numberbatch](https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet-numberbatch), which have been found to have excellent performance while reducing issues of [learning human bias](https://gist.github.com/rspeer/ef750e7e407e04894cb3b78a82d66aed).  Learning how to construct these word vectors is a bit beyond the scope of what we can cover in this notebook, but [this two-part blog post provides an excellent introduction](http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/).\n",
