       "'I have been using Webroot for several years now. I like how easy it is to update my subscription, conduct my own scans if needed, and set up regular scans. There is a fantastic feature that checks websites while I am browsing the web using search engines. Webroot will color coat the security \"safeness\" for the website and place the appropriate color bubble with a check-mark or \\'x\\' to the left of the name. Webroot provides a detail explanation on why a particular website is deemed safe or unsafe and some of those settings can be changed to fit the user\\'s preferences.\\n\\nThis particular purchase: \"Webroot SecureAnywhere Internet Security Plus 3 Device Download\" provides the download code once purchase has been completed. It\\'s great because, like I said I\\'ve been using Webroot for several years and already have the software on my computer. I didn\\'t need to buy and wait for a disc to ship to me. This download enabled me to install if I needed too (which I didn\\'t need) or I could pull the code to renew my current subscription (which is what I did), completely disc free. Like the description states, it can be used for 3 devices. So if you need to install Webroot or just need the code to renew, this particular product will fit your needs.\\n\\nI am completely satisfied with Webroot\\'s performance. I not only browse on my own home internet but I have used wifi provided by airports, coffee shops, libraries, and office buildings. I\\'ve even used international wifi and Webroot does a fantastic job keeping my computer and my information safe from preying eyes, viruses, and mal-ware.'"
