"Kaspersky offers the best security for your computer. It has kept me safe on the Internet for years. It notifies me of sites that are dangerous. It even got rid of a virus that I didn't know that I had. I wouldn't use any other Antivirus, Firewall."
This Value was extremely discounted which I appreciate - because I worked with a client trying to find each one of the software separately - so this combination was perfectly priced.
Some dufus probably got stock options by the truckload on the premise this new limitation would make a ton of money for Intuit.  Other dufuses around a table agreed.  Too bad.
I have reviewed the software and it is beyond my expectations. I will use Amazon for all my future needs. Thank you...Rick
"Plain old simple you need Anti-Virus,I have tried the free ones and other brands. Norton is my favorite because of its simple interface.

This wraps you in a blanket of security. I got this after a scary virus or something hit my computer and locked it up asking for monkey. After I had to re-image my PC, I the coated it with Norton 360."
"Highly recommend it , and my purchase was quick and easy"
It does eveything I need and works with my current machines and Operating Systems including Win 7 Ultimate! Great deal.
"With no manual or instructions on how to use this software, it was a hit or miss situation."
"If you want a simple to use program to manage personal finances Quicken is for you. I have found it very useful for keeping track of my checking and savings accounts. You can also make automatic posts to your accounts. Which is nice feature if you use automatic online bill pay with your bank. The program makes charts, graphs and reports showing where your money is going and coming from. It also does a nice job showing you if where you are meeting your budget and where you are spending too much money. Quicken makes keeps track of loans easy. It calculates how much money is going to interest and principle. I have been having a hard time and have been unsuccessful at setting up the program to track my 403B account. Overall, I think Quicken is a good program and recommend it to anyone to anyone who does not have a similar product already."
"I used Memeo backup for several years, and only that long because it was so time consuming to choose a replacement.

GOOD:
It's better than having no backup. Having multiple versions of each file saved me quite a few times.

BAD
It's buggy buggy buggy. It crashed a lot and interfered with file access (such as frequent saves). It also sometimes missed files so I had to check to make sure that the most important files were actually backed up."
"Been using this since the DOS days,  It is a stable product with not very many glitches that saves me a lot of time."
Good software
"Honestly, I bought this to replace it's bigger brother -- thinking it would be easier and more intuitive and friendly with their new nexGen technology. This product has a steep learning curves and a thick, but useless user guide that explains each tool but not how to use it. I've tried (in vain) to design my upcoming remodel. In both programs, I stopped, just plain overwhelmed and discouraged."
works great
"I bought this program to track my personal checking account/expenses. What I wanted was Quicken like it use to be around 2003, last time I used it. Then is was easy, intuitive and helpful. However, within a few minutes of loading the program I was nearly brought to tears when I synced with my bank (which as a sidebar, you do not seem to have an option to not sync...they want to get right into your bank account). Quicken does not ask which accounts to sync when it does the set up it just grabs all accounts...so my personal account, my kids accounts, my business account, my business line of credit and savings were all synced. It then happily gave me my net worth based upon all of this. Arrrgg!! How hard would it be to ask which accounts? I then tried to delete the accounts only to get a message that I had to contact my bank to do that...3 people later at the bank, no one had any idea what Quicken meant. At that point I threw in the towel for a few weeks. I am working up the courage to go back in and try to see how I can follow one simple checking account to track expenses and tax receipts. An earlier reviewer who said he was very computer and accounting savvy trashed this version for its difficulty of use and total lack of any sort of intuitiveness. He was absolutely correct. Using this is misery for the beginner."
"I like Outlook for organizing my Email - when I upgraded to Windows 8  Office Home and Student did not include Outlook??
A big gap but the Microsoft needed the revenue.  Reviews convinced me that Outlook 2013 is not ready yet - I went with 2010 and it is working great on Win 8"
I already did the installation of the Norton Antivirus and it was straight forward and it is working excellent!!!!!
"I am also a small business owner and once again am frustrated that the upgrade is being forced on us. I have used Qkbks since 1997 because it was a simple reasonably priced program. And through the years, our accounting needs have not changed much.  Intuit claims there are customers out there that have needs that require Intuit to add more and more features to their program and that has costs and blah, blah, blah.  Well then let those customers that need more pay for more advanced versions of a program.  There are still many of us that don't have those advanced needs.  Growth can be a great thing and Intuit absolutely should cater to those needs for those customers.  But they are forgetting about the little guy that would like to continue using their small and simple accounting program - the one that was once good and affordable.

LISTEN TO US INTUIT - YOUR PRODUCT IS NO LONGER AFFORDABLE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES!  Why are you not hearing this??  This economy requires us small businesses to be smart and diligent to be able to survive and we have to do business with the right people and companies in order to be successful.  INTUIT is no longer one of those companies.  Not only has the product and pricing surpassed the reach of the small business, the customer service and support is a true joke.  Wake up and pay attention to your customers and not just the financial statement.  In case you have forgotten, those two things do go hand in hand!!

I am stuck with your program until someone else decides that we small businesses are important customers too.  But I would like to know -  is ""stuck"" really the word you want customers saying when talking about your product?  That is definitely how I have felt for many years now."
"Version 11 of Dragon NaturallySpeaking is working well for me. There are some new window control techniques which are nice and the premium version has more options for macros, etc. They appear to have changed the phonetic spelling somewhat so that it doesn't work quite as well. I.e., spelling the word ""very"" using the phonetic alphabet, I get something like ""Victor ERY"" more often, though it's a subtle change. Overall I'm pretty pleased."
Good product and better price than ebay.
"I am absolutely furious.  I have been an Intuit and Quicken customer for years, always upgrading year after year, but now Quicken has become a separate company and they are migrating my id to their own system.  FINE, but I can not longer use my software; ALL of my financial information is locked in a file I can not longer open.  I can get NO ONE to answer their phone because of so called high volume, NONE of the work arounds work, NO unlocking emails are showing up. Creating a new account will not work because no emails will come through.  Yes I have checked the spam filter, I even checked my accounts online to see if the emails were held there.  Quicken is simply not sending me codes.  I am ready to spit nails.  If they are going to force a new log in they need to make sure their system works.  IT DOES NOT.  So, if you want to loose access to 15 years of your financial information with absolutely no recourse, go ahead and use quicken.  I will be shopping for a different product immediately.  By the way, in my lifetime I have never ever bothered to post a bad review.  As a business owner myself I try to be patient with companies, but there is no excuse for this level of incompetence.  They should have migrated people at a speed they could actually handle."
"I'm always a bit leery of Big Software: packages that try to do too much, install too many components, try to get their hooks set all over your system.  So I was a bit leery installing the newest release of Roxio Easy Media Creator, which has been growing rapidly into bloat-ware in recent releases.  It turned out that Ipleasantly surprised to find it more streamlined, cleaner, and professional-looking than previously.

Although one of the big ""enhancements"" in this release is Vista support, I tested this package on my Windows XP Pro machine, on which I was previously running Roxio Creator 9.  I cleanly removed Creator 9 first since installing on top of an old version is always a bad idea, many software complaints seem to arise from not uninstalling the old software first.  Install was straightforward if a bit slow to run on my Inpiron Dual Core system.

My primary purpose in buying Roxio, like many of you, is to create media.  Burning CDs, DVDs, etc is the core strength of Roxio, and they continue to do this well.  One of my frequent tasks is burning CDs from ISO images.  Roxio did this with literally 4 clicks, nice and easy.

The master control panel has been streamlined and it's now easier to get to all of the functions of the package.

Some of the old bloat is gone (the ""ringtone maker"" is no longer included), although big extraneous components like the PhotoSuite photo editor and audiox mixing tools remain.  Those may be useful to the neophyte, but anybody wanting to really tweak their photos is likely to fire up an Adobe product, or something that came with their camera, or with their computer, or some other full featured package.  Including such superfluous programs in a Media Creator suite (when they are available from so many other sources) seems excessive, but I guess it lets the publisher lengthen the feature list.

Other major enhancements include support for Blu-Ray, HD DVD, and HD video, though I didn't have the equipment to check out that new functionality.

If you don't need the Vista support, or the enhanced DVD support, there's not a burning reason (pun intended!) to upgrade from Roxio Creator Suite 9 to Roxio Creator Suite 10.  But if you're in the market, this is a fine product and does its core media work as advertised.

While I wish it were more streamlined still, the software works well, installs easily, and has become more streamlined than before.  Recommended with a 5 star rating."
"This CD Rom is just awsome.  My daughter just loves playing on the computer now.

It also has helped her in school.  Looks like it may be a nice summer after all."
Glad webroot lets me enter code and not have to load anything!
"Magix music maker sucks!!!!

No proper phone support, the built-in instrument sounds like... well.... ancient, low quality, not up to todays standards, and it can't even use a 3rd party sound synth(dxi nor vsti) to make up for that.  This software is only good for maybe hip-hop(where instruments sound fake anyways). Do yourself a favour and get cakewalk music creator instead which actually costs about the same anyways, and you get much more quality sounds...and allows 3rd party sound synths (both dxi and vsti)too (if you want other instrument sounds).i.e. expandable."
"My computer wouldn't run correctly (open or close programs) after installing this. It wasn't easy to delete it, but after doing so, my computer operated normally."
I don't like having to buy a new program every couple of years when the old one works grat!  But it is required apparently to continue to use online banking.  I don't like change and the looks of the program changes although I cannot see any significant differences.  What a racket.
"Taxes, Done...  no complaints!  Easy and quick for a household that itemizes their taxes."
"Oh, man I love this program! I got my 7 year-old on this program over the summer to get him ahead on reading. What I didn't know was how much he'd enjoy it! After school started this year his teacher was impressed with how far ahead he had gotten! There are so many lessons and games that he wants to play it nearly every day! Sometimes he will walk around and mimic the Pirate guy's voice like a parrot. I also have a 6 year-old and a 3 year-old on the other levels, and both love it. I definitely recommend this!!"
I downloaded the trial version of this software and used it for a month before purchasing.  I found that it did not slow down the PC like my past security software did (Norton and Zone Alarm).  I actually prefered the e-mail scanning from Zone Alarm because of the way it treated SPAM. But this is a very good product overall and it has a great price for a two year subscription. Buy it!
Just as advertised.
"I took my musician son's advice and bought this program so I could re-learn to play the bass after 40 years.
I couldn't be happier with it as I have been practicing with the tabs and with music I always loved. Guitar Pro 6 is very in-depth and the more you learn the more features you will enjoy all the way up to composing your own music. I highly recommend it!"
Abode readers good quality clearly if you watching movie and image picture
"Voice recognition software has come a long way. I began by trying the voice recognition engine in XP Professional, but was not pleased with the accuracy. Dragon has it together. It works. This version has definitely improved upon previous ones. They obviously have the engineering staff to do the job.

The most important aspect of accuracy is careful pronunciation. You do not realize how imprecise your words are in the everyday conversation until you use voice recognition software.

Dragons can be fearsome, but not this one."
"My grandson loves dinosaurs and he really enjoys this game....better yet....it is also a learning game. He picked it up, started playing with little guidance...a great game"
Great addition to my GPS
"Have tried in vain to develop a calendar; all goes well until you try to enter text in the text box. The tutorial doesn't assist you in that navigation. Otherwise, I would have had a beautiful calendar to send to family members."
steep learning curve but good!!!
This product is a great addition if you live in a city in which landmarks and roads constantly change. I have downloaded one map update since having this service and the difference is clearly noticeable.
"Drive Genius has saved me time and time again. I have been using it for many years--it used to be distributed by Apple as part of it's ""Apple Care"" program. So far as I'm concerned, it's the one non-Apple utility that's a must-have for Mac users. It does something that no Apple utility will do for you--it WARNS you that your disk needs to be repaired--before you have a crisis on your hands. You can then use either Drive Genius or Apple's Disk Utility to verify and make repairs. My last experience with Drive Genius was really impressive. It didn't just warn me to repair the HD--it told me to back up and replace it ASAP. I ran Apple Disk Utility. It said the the disk was fine, no problems. I didn't believe it. So I restarted my computer in ""recovery mode"" and tried to run Disk Utility again--the hard drive completely crashed at that point. Drive Genius was right. I just spoke with a representative from Prosoft Engineering: he said you can no longer buy Drive Genius in the App Store because it's not an Apple product--but Apple has an Enterprise License so its employees can use Drive Genius.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Drive-Genius-4-Speed-Up-Clean-up-Protect-Your-Mac-Used-By-Apple-Genius-Bar/dp/B00S1VTXTO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Drive Genius 4, Speed Up, Clean up & Protect Your Mac, Used By Apple Genius Bar</a>"
"Also found out when we called tech support they want to sell you something else or upgrades when you just really want to use the program you bought.  Not easy to work with. You'll need some coaching from an outside source, other then quickbooks."
"I have used Quickbooks for years to create invoices.  I use invoices to track the amount of maintenance I do on my cars.  I am not an accountant and did not need all the accounting stuff that went along with Quickbooks.  This was an excellent breakout from this product.  It allowed me to create invoices without having to track all the financial aspects of a business.  This software did allow me to input an inventory, so I am still able to select items from a list.  However, it does not allow you to track an inventory (i.e. input a list and then update the quantity you have on hand at any given time).  Since I do not track an inventory, this did not bother me.  Overall this product allowed me to update from a much older version of Quickbooks without having to spend $100.00 to do so.  I should also mention that I was unable to import my data from my older version of Quickbooks.  This was more of a blessing in disguise as I was unable to import much of the garbage I and accumulated over the years.  It should also be noted that I did put any effort into transfer my older data into excel and trying to import it that way. Overall, I am very happy with this product."
"This is an O.K. program.  Just O.K.  Very limited in features, not really suitable for our use."
"On time delivery, and product was as described."
"It's tax software, it does what it needs to do, and I haven't been audited yet. Although if you're running a business, you probably need to know a bit about balance sheets, etc to begin with.

Minus one star because these morons still can't import data from Quickbooks online. Hello!!!! You guys write Quickbooks and you push the online version. Shouldn't your tax software read from that too?"
"all I am interested in is a product that supports antivirus only, not something that's going to take over my computer, its the greatest."
"Bought it for the good review. It never worked even with the online support help. The SW never talked to the HW. The support blame the Windows-XP-SP2 missing drivers. I did reload the Windows-SP2 and still does not work.
Save your money and buy a real midi keyboard. This one never really got tested under customer hands."
"I have my own ways of using Quicken related to my personal record keeping needs.  Quicken 2007 allowed me more flexbility to do that.  For example the new version automated the cross reference between accounts such as my credit cards and my checking account.  Now it just says transfer which can have a number of different meanings for me as I often transfer funds between members of the family and funds from CD interest to my checking account.  I did note that the list of categories includes ""transfer:credit card"" but only ""transfer"" displays when I am looking at the file. The same with medical entires which may be Rx or doctor bills.  Also I like to narrow the width of the columns so all my memos show in full but the next time I open the program it goes back to the default.  Also changes in the ascending or descending order of the date column goes back to the default in the same way.  When I make a change in format that the program allows I want it to stay that way.  I also preferred the ""Insight"" small display to the new way of showing the list of accounts.  In all I liked the 2007 version more than the 2015.  I am retired and only use Quicken for personal needs."
Certainly the price drew me to purchase it from Amazon.  The software is great.
"My four-year-old daughter was not interested in using the computer at preschool so we bought this at the school's book fair.  Well, now she is VERY interested in the computer.  She too has spent countless hours playing this game.  It was very simple for her to master her way around without little help from myself.  It is not only a fun game but also a game that teaches word and picture recognition.  I would highly recommend this software to other parents; in fact, I am going to put some more Clifford titles on her Christmas list!"
Great as usual.
I love this software.  I was able to convert a lot of DVDs into files to watch on my phone and tablet for a long trip.  It creates DVD quality files of entire movies in 30-45 minutes each. I haven't tried copying an video from the internet just yet.
Been using since Turbo Tax became available.
"Unacceptable.  Returned.
Reading privacy agreement made me uncomfortable."
"WordPerfect continues to improve itself incrementally, and those of us who use it admire its evolutionary qualities. It's ability to provide close control over textual formatting remains a plus."
"This year's version worked great!  My one tax issue this year was making sure I wasn't taxed on a Roth IRA withdrawal that was a return of investment (so no tax, and no penalty).  The program handled it with no problem putting it right where it should on form 8606 part III.  The electronic filing was easy and we got our state and federal refunds quickly."
I like the software download option as I don't have to worry about having the media with me when I want to install it on computers that are displaced in different locations.  I highly recommend this option and this vendor.  Everything has worked smoothly.
App never worked.
Windows 7 works great
"I love the Mill Creek Entertainment DVD's! Like others have said, this is a repackaging of their 70's and 80's movie 50 pack collections, full of great (I mean mostly cheesy and terrible and oh so easy to make fun of) old flicks.

I purchased this for my white elephant office party. A good friend in the office ended up taking this home last night and he was fully excited to go home, drink eggnog and rum and have a great evening. Merry Christmas!"
"I've used a variety of software products to capture videos, especially tutorials I need, and there's always been something missing. This Movavi Screen Capture Studio is the best I've used to date.

Many will capture the screen video, but the final product is far from what I need. For example, Snagit, which I used to use, gives me too small an area and the on-screen text is not clear enough. Not so with this product. I can recommend it and the price was very appealing, too."
Worked great.  I loaded it on 4 computers with no trouble.
"After years of happy use of Printshop v. 20 on my Windows XP, I bought a new computer with Windows 7 64 bit.  I lost my old computer & software in a recent flood, so I knew I'd have to upgrade to a newer version of Printshop.  I checked the Microsoft Compatibility guide, and sadly found no current information on the software.  Then recently, the site stated that the older version 23 of Printshop WAS found to be compatible with 7 / 64 bit, so I ordered it from Amazon. On installing, I got an error message stating that my system needed Microsoft Net Framework v1.1, which was NOT compatible.  Not willing to give up on an old friend, I discovered the fix on the Encore Software site.  You must do a CLEAN install, and disable all your start-up items, then the disc will install with no errors.  On starting for the first time afterwards, the system will automatically update and fix any errors.  Wallah! Printshop 23 is installed and working correctly in my system, and I have my old friend back.  The one feature that will NOT work on Win 7 / 64bit is the ""save as PDF"" feature.  Encore states you can download another type of PDF software that will work, but I've not tried that yet.  Here is the link to the Encore help page:

"I actually picked this up without reading the box. My bad.
I like to try different security software to spread my luck around on the different equipment, hoping if one has a hole the other might not, and thus skirting system wide failure. But seeing that this is not even the internet security suite, I am not that brave these days. Antivirus and antispyware used to make me feel safe, but I like a widere birth of protection these days on my personal and the families PCs either way. So if you are okay with the bare minimum, this isn't a bad price, but I'd rather pay a bit more and get wider protection."
"Just didn't grab me, so I spent little time with it.  Looks like a learning curve with not much payoff."

"I looked in Costco for Microsoft Office, prepared to spend a couple hundred dollars or more as I have at least every couple of years. I have a new laptop and new Surface and wanted to put it on there. I couldn't find it in Costco, so I looked on Amazon to order it from here. I don't like any of the options that Microsoft is offering. Thanks to the reviews I have learned about LibreOffice and have just downloaded it. WOW. Looks the same to me, and will suit my purposes. I would not have searched for something new if Microsoft didn't change. Why change something that's worked for all this time Microsoft? Don't mess with people's money...you just cause them to try something new. I will be making a $150 donation to The Document Foundation and won't feel a need for Microsoft Office anymore."
"Thank you for this detailed and personal note (redacted below). I understand your concern. Technical or customer support other than the complaint form was not easily or clearly visible, and once I saw that the product did not work, I just followed up on the email I received from Amazon regarding comments and returns. As for the disc itself, I thought it might be my particular Mac Mini that didn't want to accept the disc. So, I spent a great deal of time and effort trying to figure out a way to have a different disc reader or computer attached to the Mini as a workaround. So, after some sturm und drang, I succeeded in linking my MacBook Pro (a work computer) with my Mini. But the same thing happened with the disc - the computer spit it out after about 1 minute of ""thinking"" about it. It did not recognize or mount the disc - even though I wouldn't have used it on the MacBook Pro, which is already running 10.7.5.

I do not have additional time to spend seeking tech support and will be returning the disc. Here's why: I live in Israel. The disc was shipped to a friend's house in New Jersey and brought here when he came for a business trip. He is now leaving tonight for the USA, and I am going to have him return the disc via the directions Amazon offered (UPS pickup at his house, I believe.)

So, whether I try again with another disc, or take the far more expensive step of purchasing a NEW generation Mini (that's $550 v. $30 for the upgrade, which is probably only a temporary fix, anyway, but still may be worthwhile financially, as a new Mac Mini wasn't necessarily in my budget at this time), I will be returning the current disc and seeking a refund.

Again, thank you for the response. I will consider your request. Please feel free to contact me again or to call if you have additional questions or suggestions.

Great product. I have been using it for some years now and it never fails me.
Great product
better than some of the alternatives.  If you just are looking for a couple of sounds this might be worth the $5.  Certainly better than the Snap! 2000 Sound Effects.
Took a minute to get used to but runs great!
"Started using PC Tuneups when it came as a freebie with a Nero purchase.  It cleaned up a lot of garbage, and allowed me to identify which programs were being started automatically and choose to disable them.  PC performance increased significant.  This type around I had a little difficulty with a file association being opened by the wrong app on Windows 8.  Tried to download the software from their web site, but there were issues with the downloaded software accepting the license key, said wrong product.  Asked for help, never heard anything from them.  Ultimately, corrected the file association issue on my own, and was successful in getting it loaded and license accepted.  Software is great, support non-existent."
"I read about Snow Leopard in MacLife magazine. My son later expounded its virtues. The main message I was hearing was that it is a smaller, faster OS due to its being written only for Intel-Macs. So I decided to purchase it and install it on my Mini and see what happens. The first things I noticed is that it boots and shuts down faster. The reviews stated that smaller and faster were the main advantages of this upgrade. But there are certain functions that give improved eye candy in other programs. Right after I installed it I found that my All-in-One printer wouldn't scan anymore. This was resolved when I downloaded the latest drivers from HP. Ditto with a utility or two. Overall, it has been a painless upgrade. Snow Leopard is NOT for PPC Macs."
I was pleased with the prompt service I received.  I am even more pleased with the product.
"Don't buy this product.  It did not meet my expectations.  I purchased NaturallySpeaking 6.0 and I worked with it for about seven hours today in hopes of getting it working with some degree of accuracy.  I spent over two hours ""performing additional training"" which consists of reading/recording on-screen passages to improve the accuracy of recognizing my voice.  I ran the Acoustic Optimizer at least a dozen times after making corrections to dictated passages.  Despite these steps, the program continued to make the same mistakes. It never seemed to be as dynamic at adapting to my corrections, as the product claims would indicate.  The drop down Correction Menu would almost never have the correction choice that I was seeking despite making the same correction repeatedly and running the Acoustic Optimizer.
I don't think that the productivity gains I was hoping for from this product could ever be realized.  I think that I would spend as much time making corrections to documents as it would take to type them the old fashioned way."
"I purchased this item to renew my Norton 360 Premier subscription. Upon entering the Product Key, I got a message that the product key was invalid; it was not a key for Norton 360 Premier.  Please be aware when you purchase this item."
"Amazing.  I can purchase a new copy on the Parallels web site for $59.99 but as a registered user of Parallels 7 and 8, I still have to pay $49.99.  What a deal for loyal users isn't it?  I would try a different product unless you want to pay $50 year after year for no real change in functionality unless you move to all new Mac hardware.  I originally switched to Parallels from a competitive product but now I see that was a mistake.  Also, I can't even figure out how to ask them a question.  Their web page has no way to contact customer support.  Avoid this at all costs regardless of what others say.  It works but so do other products at lest overall and continued cost."
"I bought this because I could no longer use my 2008 version (in an ""update"", the entire WORD disappeared from my computer, and Microsoft could not find it when I enquired; also, it could no longer be downloaded nor activated with a key code - non-supported). So in a way I was ""forced"" to upgrade. I did NOT like the pressure to buy into Office 365, with its continual pay by the month charge. MS WORD is the industry standard, so what more can you say about the product? It is the sales method and pressure that I do not buy into, and my rating reflects that."
very poor service. I have spent about 99$ and I'm still unable to download the software.
"This product is freaking amazing.  You talk, it types.  Setup requires reading some test paragraphs, but once that's done, the rest is all down hill.  Buy it, you'll never regret it.  It is truly amazing software."
"I have found Snow Leopard to be a disappointment so far. It has stopped at least two of my most often used programs from working, as well as taking the networking ability away from the Airport Express. Now only one of the three computer in the house can print. At this point I have backed down to 10.5.8 using an external HD.  For the time being I am going to remove Snow Leopard Completely till Apple can get it together."
Having ordered MS Word 2002 I received MS Works Suite 2004 which includes MS Word but a version intended to be distributed with a new PC only and as such would not load on my old system. No refund available because I broke seal before finding out it was a for-new-system only package.
Arrive quickly and in excellent shape.  One thing I was hoping for was written instructions on what it can do.  I am still learning how to use it.
"I purchased this upgrade to Professional from Home Premium. i began the installation. I accepted the license and proceeded with the upgrade. It failed without error messages. There was a link in the installer to go online to try and resolve the issue. I clicked on the link and was taken to an MS support site. I was forced to signup for MS Live before being able to proceed. Once I did that, I was taken to a page where I was told that I was going to be charged $249 for a support call. Unbelievable!!!
Update 1 - I called Amazon support, they gave an MS support number for this problem. 866 234 6020. I called and talked to an entry level support person who was not helpful. I was then transferred to Install support. That transfer was dropped. I was  on hold or in phone jail for 25 minutes before being connected.
Update 2 - I was connected to a helpful MS tech support person. We disabled all non-MS programs. The install then proceeded fine. Re-enable all programs on reboot and everything is good. Changed review from 1 star to 4."
"I used the Windows 8 developer trial on a fresh partition of my hard drive to see what it was like, and here is what I feel that people should know about Windows 8.

To start off, here are the good things:

-Amazingly fast boot time
 On my computer it takes Windows 7 about 45 seconds to launch, Windows 8 took about 15 seconds.
-Windows Live tiles
 This is the main feature that Microsoft is marketing about Windows 8, I will not elaborate too much on this, as I am sure you have an idea what this feature has to offer.
-Access to applications exclusive to Windows 8
 Some applications may be exclusive to Windows 8, so you might not have access to that new app everyone is talking about.

Sadly, that is about it, and though these are three big pluses, there are quite a few big minuses.

-No Start button
 The Windows start button (the one you probably see in the bottom left corner of your screen) no longer exists. Meaning that many of the tools you use to quickly navigate your computer are gone, including the search bar. Looking for that term paper you stored in some random file because you were about to pass out, good luck, you can't simply type in something in the search bar and find it instantly.
-Poor Navigation
 Those people used to the Windows 7 explorer tool (the one with an image of a file for an icon) are going to face a huge change in how you navigate your files. It it much more complex, with similar controls to Office 2010, have fun learning how to use that on top of everything else different about your OS.
-Compatibility
 Of course, as with all new OS's you may face some compatibility issues, though this is expected.

Conclusion:
These are the questions that I would have asked if I were about to buy Windows 8, personally, I would say that the typical user should stay with or upgrade to Windows 7. Really you should try the Windows 8 developer trial to get a feel for it, there are many tutorials on how to set up dual boot computer, so you can try it out and switch back to your current OS without any file loss."
"The person who sold me their name is:::  L&Y BUSINESS. All I wanted was to purchase a brand new, nice, norton internet security software. I was appalled greatly. Not only was the packaging rotten with some liquid on the orange, big envelope. It Was DISGUSTING what this guy sold me with. i open inside and the pkg it self  was USED ALREDY OPENED. DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!! This rediculous never have i have this nightmare.  All I asked for is that i get the quality with what i paid for and TO get a brand new Norton Software Security.

The  big envelope contained some kind of nasty grime like he pissed on it before he sent it. i open inside...... no installation guide or intro booklet just a cd. so he says i should try out the cd. ................and it didn't work either. it was a damaged product.  beware"
I wish there was a better product to do this job.
Great Product
"Wouldn't work with any of my computers so it was money wasted.
Tired on line fix and that didn't work either.
Becareful to check what it will work on."
"With all the complaints, I was a bit reluctant to purchase the 2004 version of Quicken.  However, since I was still on 2001, I decided to bite the bullet.  While the interface is disappointing and there really isn't anything new or improved, the product works well.  Next time I purchase an upgrade, though, I probably won't need the business portion and, seen as how Intuit never really adds any features of importance, I'll settle for Quicken basic.  There's really no point is paying for stuff you can get elsewhere for free - like investment analysis."
Updated the manga studio 5.  Bought by my daughter after taking a graphics art class at our local community college.
"I bought this, hoping it would have some fun math and reading games for my child, but it was so boring. It had this horrible voice repeating the instructions over and over again before you could play. Even a child with angelic patience wouldn't want to sit through that every time. It now sits in our house, never used...more clutter."
"It`s very fast works great. I`ve  tried other back up software but I always go back to Acronis for it`s speed,performance,reliability, and ease of use. Acronis True Image 2015 is so simple to use it`s CRAZY good! LUV it."
This is like buy a license i bought this cd and when i downloaded it they gave me the 2015 version.
I had a lot of trouble installing kindle on my mac! It keeps crashing! It was a nightmare and finally i decided to forget about it and now i'm settled with kindle app on my iphone.
I've used PP for maybe 20 years.  I upgrade about every third version.  This is a great upgrade from PP11.  The price was very good. $ for $ PP is the only scanner software to have.
"MS 2007 OFFICE PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE: I had read other reviews of the new version and with talking with others decided I would have to upgrade from 2003 Office Pro to Office Pro 2007. Yes, I am starting to love it... but why do they not tell you where the print button is? It is hidden under the icon on the top left! It sure has many bells and whistles. The learning curve took my productivity from 100% to 25% for about two weeks. But now that has passed I am back up and running again. I am in my fifties and so maybe if you are older thinking you can't learn... well you can! Just have patience and lots of time on weekends to go through stuff. I did hope I would maybe get on offer to upgrade cheaper to Office Pro 2010 since that just came out... but to date have not gotten that. All in all I would upgrade because sooner or later you just have to keep up with the times."
"I have no problem with the vendor.  They were timely and responded to my concerns quickly.  The problem was that WordPerfect Office X4 Professional Upgrade was an educational program which would not allow me to upgrade from version 3.  I expressed my concerns to the Vendor and on February 16 I received an e-mail from the vendor advising me to send the product back to them and on receipt of it they would issue a refund.  I returned the product on or about February 25,2013 and am waiting for the return."
Good deal on the price. Almost half the 2010 price and with essentially the same features. QB Pro is a great accounting program but it takes a while to learn all the featuresfor non-accounting types. I had QB Basic and this is much more advanced. Upside is you get much more in terms of reports and analysis
"I can't even get this thing to activate itself!  Every time it starts it comes up with an Activation dialog but nothing works.  It says it can't talk to the server.  I went to try manual activation but the URLs it provides don't even work in a web browser!  I'm professionally both a software developer and a network engineer, so I'm a computer expert and I can't get this thing to work properly.  This is absolutely terrible and there is no excuse for software working this poorly.  I'll likely have to return the product without even using it because it if won't even register then I don't want anything to do with the company that sells it because it shows they are unreliable.  I'm very, very disappointed."
Was extremly disappointed in this software. Does not do what I envisioned and it was to involved and time consuming. I tried it and after several days removed it from my computer. I had Quicken about 6 years ago on my old computer and it was much better!
It works.
360 Internet Security I Have Been Using The On My Android And My Laptop Even On The Android Phone This Will Not Work With Windows 10 . Try It Out For Yourself Who Know You May Have Found Something That Work Real Well. It The Best I Found On Or Around The Net.
"Been in office work over 35 years.  Quickbooks Pro is the most user friendly program I've ever used and still maintains very important information, reports, etc.... Anyone can use it..."
"My 8 yr olds official review is ""Mom these games are boring"".  I also bought Star Wars Math Jabba's Game Galaxy which he played first and loves.  In fact he didn't want to shut it off.  Then he played this and I have to agree this seems boring in comparison.  Decent math practice but have to promise he can play Jabba Math after just to get him to play it."
"I ordered it thinking it was a DVD, but it is actually an old school CDRom.  Luckily my daughter has a computer capable of running a CDRom.  Just make sure before you order, this is what you're looking for."
works well
Kind of confusing and hard to save photos edited
"I just started using the product, and have noticed little difference from the previous version except for the way you access things from the ribbon. Maybe after I use it for a while, I will get an epiphany, but for now, so what!"
"Nicely staged instruction.  Games are rather fun.  Cannot resize instruction window. I recommend this software, at least under Windows 7."
"I DARE BILL GATES TO USE THIS COMPUTER WITH THE XP SOFTWARE WHICH CONSTANTLY HAS --LOADING ERRORS--- AND ASKS IF I SHOULD REPORT IT.  HAVE YOU SAID YES?  THEN IT TAKES MORE TIME OUT OF YOUR SCHEDULE WAITING FOR IT TO DO ITS THING.

THE WORD SOFTWARE GENERALLY WORKS WELL-BUT AGAIN I HAD TO BUY A DUMMIE BOOK TO USE FOR RESEARCH BECAUSE THE HELP INFO WAS WRITTEN FOR GEEKS, NOT ME.  IT IS SO FRUSTRATING THAT I KEEP THREATENING TO DITCH THIS AND GO TO APPLE.

BUT, APPLE'S PRICES ARE ----OUTRAGEOUS-----

SO, I'M STUCK FOR THE TIME BEING, BUT I DO HAVE AN IOMAGA BACK-UP HARD DRIVE FOR THE NEXT TIME THIS SOFTWARE CRASHES, AND YOU DON'T EVEN GET A KISS."
"My little sister and I got this for Christmas. I wasn't so sure about it at first, 'cause Barbie's for lil' kids, but once I started playing I couldn't stop. The way it works is that you first choose a routine, girl to perform, and your skating style. (Easy, medium, or expert) After you have practiced, you choose her outfit, music, ice color, decorations, etc. Then you get to skate your show. There are five stops on the tour, finishing with a secret, mysterious, magical ice rink. You'll find out what it is when you get there! After you finish the tour, you get to put on exhibition shows, where you can choose from all the costumes, routines, music, locations- everything from the previous tours. Let me tell you, I am a competitive gymnast, not a figure skater, and this game still is one of my favorite computer games. It will appeal to everyone."
"This product sucks big time.  Do not buy.  I bought this thinking it could replace mvelopes and simplify my life by consolidating all of my finances in one area.  Boy was I wrong.  There are so many bugs.  After setting the program up once, I called customer service only to find that the errors I was experiencing was too drastic that I had to reset everything again.  This is after being on hold with customer service for over 6 hours and then talking for them for another 4 hours.  Can you believe the hold line was 105 people ahead of me????  That was just the first time.  With the new technologies these days, it would be nice to receive a call back.  Also, the customer service hours suck....M-F from 8-5PM PST.  These hours don't work if one works full-time and travels insanely with kids.  Do not buy this product.

I would never buy a quicken product again.  I bought it once 12 years ago and experienced problems then.  I thought I give it a shot thinking by now, things should have improved.  Wrong.

What kills me is that I'm now 2 days beyond the 60 day return policy because I was so hopeful to have everything work.  AAACCCK"
Love it
"I selected this item with good intentions, but then ran out of computer ram to add any additional software. By the time I upgraded the computer, the software was outdated. Never even tried it - asked my accountant if I should install & work with it anyway, but was told to go with the newest version."
I am enjoying my purchase.  Amazon was very quick to respond to my order and answer an email concerning it.  It is taking me some time to learn the full set of features that these updates provide me.  Overall I am happy with what I got.  I would like to able to produce a finished video and burn it in a higher definition than I seem to be able to do.  The program iWorks'09 is just an extra to me as I do not use it because MS Office seems to fill the bill.
This year I had a lot of stock purchases to account for and Turbotax's option of bypassing the interview and entering the information directly really sped things up and made my life a lot easier.
"I purchased the download version (it was the same price as the CD version).  Intuit's website specifically said it was the exactly the same as the CD version.  HOWEVER, it is NOT the same.  There are several multimedia portions of the program that simply do not function.  An error message occurs when you get to those portions.  Of course, you can still use that feature of the program by clicking past each message, but it is annoying.  Every other click, the message occurs.

I contacted customer service, both through Intuit's live support and via email.  The answer was the same ""just continue to use the function.""  In other words, just ignore the messages.  They want me to continue to ignore the messages (somewhat like they ignored my problem.)  Both contacts with them, the answers were worded ALMOST exactly the same.  Very ""pat"" answers.

I will not purchase Intuit products again."
Great Product to use with Alexia
Worked great!
"I read a lot of reviews for this product, many complaints about its limitations. I had used SiteSpinner, and then upgraded to SiteSpinner Pro.
Its not that hard. If your having trouble with it, your not trying hard enough. I was able to build a number of great sites with it, remember web design is after all about design.
What I really want to emphasize here is the absolutely stunning tech support I received from the LarryD the Geezer Guru, on the Virtual Mechanic.
I needed to add functionality way beyond a simple site and he walked me through every step of the way, and provided me with everything I needed to maintain the site down the road. Take a look at nycoperascene.com to see what I mean. If I had hired a web developer this service would have been way expensive."
Not comparable with Windows 10 64 bit does not  work since Windows upgrade
"I don't know why I love it so much, I just cracked it into my new PC and got it up and running. Excellent product. Much more advanced than Vista."
Turbo Tax responded to the outcry against their revamped tax programs by offering returning users of the Deluxe version to upgrade without additional charge to the Premier version.  We were able to complete our tax return without difficulty on the upgraded version.  Still an easy-to-use and accurate way to prepare and file our tax return.
Great products for a good price! was very easy to install and it did not slow down my computer at all like some that i had in the past. overall I am very happy and will purchase again!
"Microsoft Excel 2008 has negative features that did not appear in Excel 2006.  I thought Excel 2006 would not work with Leopard, but it did and I regret having purchased Office 2008.  Furthermore, Microsoft only allows two free questions.  After that, you must pay $49 for each event!  What a rip-off."
"I have had to give a 1 for a rating but I would put a zero. When I had installed this (upgrading from 2003 system works) I figured all would be fine but I am now wondering how to get my money back it sucks big time and not only does GoBack really suck it seems to be very buggy to install, very tricky to get it right AND has massive performance hit on your machine. My opinion of this software is I would rather have the virus then have norton.  God it is just unbelieveably bad and I have been in the computer game since I was 16. I have 20+years of experience in software i was REALLY dissapointed with this package. Having had a friend experience bad things with macafee I am now going to try avg and/or panda

Regards Julian"
Doesn't work on my PC.
I like Turbo tax as it makes doing taxes easy.
"This is more about Nuance than about Dragon for Mac. Like other reviewers I faced the prospect of a forced ""upgrade"" of Dragon 2.5 when I upgraded my Mac OS version. As it turns out, the previous version of Dragon DOES continue to work, at least up through Mac OS 10.8.4. All you need to do is ignore the warning window you get when you launch the app.

Nuance pretends they're doing us a big favor by offering the upgrade (with claimed ""improvements"") at $99.99 - but that price includes an unwanted ""Family Tree Maker"" app and ALSO requires payment of a $9.95 shipping charge. If you want to download the upgrade and skip the unwanted Family Tree product, which would save Nuance the costs of two physical products and shipping them, it costs MORE.

Nuance plainly has no interest in rational pricing. Inquiries by phone and email get short shrift, with bad phone connections to a clueless ESL ""representative"" unfamiliar with the products. it's hard to understand why anyone would want to do business with such an inconsiderate and unreasonable company. As a practical matter, my experience is that the (free) dictation function in the Mac OS works about as well as Dragon's overpriced Mac product.

Here's something that makes even less sense: the free Dragon application for iPhone allows you to dictate quite adequately and email the end product to yourself at your Mac. I've found the voice navigation, correction and layout controls in the desktop version of Dragon to be hit-and-miss at best, so some cutting and pasting is almost always required anyway.

Wake up, Nuance!"
"couldn't find anymore in stores locally. So went online, better price, fast delivery. Only as always make my cpu run slowly! but it does work to protect my time online."
This is the worse piece of software I have ever installed on my computer. Don't waste your money or time.
"I like Printmaster.  I have gold 15  It came with an instruction book and several discs for art and programs.
The one I got  had only the one install disc and no9thing more.  I wanted some new cards that I didn't already have and am disapointed that there are many duplicates on the two programs."
"Nero Burning goes from strength to strength, it really does.
I first tried this product in frustration after the product my burner came with turned my burner into a coaster factory! Dozens of defective disks and no explanation why. The trial allowed me to check that my burner was compatible, for a start, and to see if the coaster-production dropped off. It was a yes on both counts so I purchased it.
I have now been using this product for two years and I think it is the best there is. It has all the functions you need for creating special CD-R's (bootable CD's, for example, or DVD's if you have a DVD-R) as well as helpful wizards to hide the complexity for new users.
I recently upgraded my burner to an external 40x Iomega firewire unit and both worked together perfectly, first time - unusual in my experience for hardware and software to be so harmonious without some tweaking! The range of burners this product supports is amazing and is clearly updated very regularly (my unit is very recent.)
If you are struggling with the lite version of some product that came with your burner, this is the product for you. It's worth every penny."
this is goos but i don't hink it all that great because the wordsdont get picked up all the time
"I like it very much - and have filed my taxes.  There is one thing I think should be improved - if it can be done.  We should be able to go back and check different sections or items whenever we wish, without having to go though the whole section over again.
  Another important item - getting our copy printed.  I t was not made clear to me or made easy for me to print my copies when I was finished and I wanted to do that.  Maybe I missed it somehow, but it kept telling me we'd get to that.  I think that should be easier.  After all, by then all the hard work is done.  Thank you."
New iteration of Office and I needed it to have an uptodate version on my wife's home computer.  It works well.
"Was very easy to use even if you need to file several schedules.  I didn't want to have to pay to file my taxes, but now I'm glad I used this one.  I can feel confident that I didn't make a math error and was able to file electronically."
It's accounting software and works.  They have made some unnecessary upgrades over the years that have driven the cost up and performance down some. But all in all it does the job and is easy enough to use.
Easy to install. Only used on one pc so far.  Set for another year! Provides complete protection.  Would definitely recommend.
This program is great. I really like the color interface. The only improvements I would recommend are to make the prime tracks easier to recognized. The other improvement is to be able to see the entire track title in the album list view. Some of the really long tracks with artist featured are not visible in this view.
"This is a total rip-off. Amazon advertises 4000 fonts; I got only 163. I was looking for Old English. Amazon does not show any font samples, but I thought that in 4,000 fonts there would be 1 old english font. There are zero--perhaps because this is falsely advertised as 4,000 fonts when there are only 163. I want my money back but Amazon won't give refunds. I will be reporting this scam to the Federal Trade Commission. Another Amazon scam: you have to click at least 1 star to write a review. I rate this ZERO stars. Don't buy from Summitsoft or amazon. Amazon says no refunds, but we'll see about that. If the seller doesn't give me a refund by close of business Monday Jan 7, I will dispute the charge to my credit card as not delivered as agreed. I thought that I would be protected by buying through Amazon, but apparently Amazon is no guaranty of quality."
Very nice and reliable product.
"I sought Windows 7 out when I found that the Hackintosh I was building would in fact not run Mac OS well without lots of complications from hardware incompatibilities.  This was in mid 2013, well into the fiasco that has become Windows 8.  It's coming up on a year now, and I've been able to use this on a number of PC builds which has gone a little way toward justifying the ridiculous prices that Microsoft demands.  It is I hope the only Microsoft OS I will ever own.  Mac OS just feels so natural and usable to me.  It gets out of the way. Windows is like driving a car in a big city, with stop light after stop light after stop light.  All red. All long.  I understand the allure of Windows to some people, I think.  There are those people who enjoy complexity, and thrive on the illusion of control that being knowledgeable about Windows OS might provide in some way.  Complexity is it's defining characteristic to me.  Unfortunately, if you want to game on a PC with top of the line GPU's, Windows is essentially the only choice."
"Good program, great for laserprinting projects and woodworking."
"Why would you use anything else? It's the industry standard and very easy to use. I've been using Final Draft since it came out and I absolutely recommend it. Mind you, you still have to proof read your work!"
"Though I was slow to catch on to using Amazon Prime music with my new Android phone - I'm SOLD, now.  I listen to my phone even more than home stereo, now - and I use the app on both.  I love the stations, guys, good work.  ANd the quality of the music I'm streaming sounds better than what my collection did before, by FAR."
"The product key supplied in the box is invalid according to the installer. I purchased this product new from Amazon.com. After several attempts to enter the correct product key, I gave up and am now trying to get Symantec to resolve the issue.  I am interested in knowing if anyone else has had this problem with their activation key.

PC specs:

AMD Phenom64 9500 Quad Core 2.2GHZ
4GB DDR Corsair memory
768MB XFX Nvidia GeForce 9600 SLI card
XFX Nvidia SLI-ready motherboard
Windows Vista Ultimate 64 Bit

Sorry Symantec. I cannot review what I cannot install."
"This has four categories: Vocabulary, Spelling, Grammar, and Composition. I tried the spelling, and grammar, but I need to try the vocabulary and composition. Composition has to have the software when using it because it will not install like the other 3x. So far I like it, not too complicated because it is easy to follow."
Complicated.
"This is just bad.  That says it all.  It throws you into a shark tank, with EVERYTHING being in Polish, from beginning to end.  The only thing I was able to absorb was the Polish alphabet.  Even learning the alphabet took me days.  The book is a much better way to go when learning a language.  This is too fast paced, spoken too quickly, and absolutely no good for beginners.  Only people who know an intermediate amount of Polish will find this good.
Pros:
Easy to learn alphabet, with practice
Cons:
Too fast paced
Everything written in Polish from start to end
No Polish/English dictionary
NO GOOD GRAMMAR HELP (biggest problem)
Speakers talk to fast, making much of the talks sound like jibberish, especially if you are new to the Polish tongue
  Overall, just plain BAD.  Transparent Language's way to approach language learning just doesn't work.  The book is a much better method.  Just take a class with the book and it will be MUCH easier and less stressful to learn another language.  And if you choose to use computer software, DO NOT use Transparent Language products."
worked good
"Never got it to burn a .wav disk.  It ripped, slowly, and did burn a mp3 disk.  It told me to contact Pyro and let them know about the error no.
I did this a couple times with no response.  I ended up calling and speaking to someone in sales.  They told me to e-mail them with all the info and they would make sure it got in the right person's hands.  I got a response telling me how to do a ""FIX"".  The step-by-step instructions were not accurate for what I was supposed to see, and after I guessed, I still got the same error no.  I called back and they actually agreed to take the program back.  I had to send a letter stating that I had deleted the program.  I was in the process of doing that and decided to try just one more time.  This time it told me I had to contact Pyro for and authorization no.  I didn't have to do that at the installation.  I still haven't figured out the program knew I was supposed to delete it.  I was disappointed, if it worked, it would have been perfect for my needs.  I guess now I'll have to try Music Match."
"This is a very good selection of Java Scripts although some of them need some hacking to actually work, they are nice."
This software won't work at all on my Surface with Windows 10 and constantly crashes on my desktop with Windows 10. Heed the other warnings!
"I've used this for over a decade and haven't been audited. (fingers crossed). Includes Sched. C and depreciation schedules, although they keep nagging you to upgrade to the Home and Business product, for more money, of course.  Intuit also offers optional low cost audit insurance in case things go bad with the IRS."
"I was just using this software trying to make a few Christmas photo cards. I consider myself somewhat computer software savvy, as I am able to figure out how to use most of it easily without too much instruction. If I would have known how much of a hassle this crappy software was to use, I would never have purchased it. In fact I felt so compelled to tell everyone how lousy it is, that I immediately closed it and signed on to Amazon to give this review. A huge waste of time and money. The older versions of the software were so much easier to use, this is really awful. I would have given it no stars but the 1 star accurately describes my feelings about the product."
"I've used Norton Utilities as well as Ontrack's System Suite (and their Fix-It Utilities), and have found Ontrack's product much more reliable and have also got better results from it. One part which I haven't yet installed is the firewall, NetDefense, primarily because I'm happy with ZoneAlarm. I was, however, curious about Ontrack's VirusScanner, as I hadn't read much about it. Turns out it's provided by Trend Micro, makers of PC-Cillin. After trying Mcafee's viruscan and trashing two machines with it, I ran Norton AV 2002 next to Ontrack's Suite, and found that Ontrack recognized two viruses that NAV didn't. I already had these viruses stored away, and while it's not a very extensive test, it gave me confidence in its virus-detecting ability.
RegEdit is one tool in this suite that has proven itself to me over and over again, both on Win2000 and a slower machine using Win98SE. After deleting useless links and such from the registry of an older machine, I got almost twice the speed from it.
Jet Defrag does its job well, much faster than Microsoft's defrag tool, but you'd do well to heed Ontrack's warning to run system/disk check first.
EasyRecovery (lite edition) is one tool that will make you want more; it allows the recovery of up to 50 files in this edition -- The full-blown EasyRecovery Pro goes for around $.... And considering the results I've had, it's worth it. I've recovered files from formatted drives, deleted files, and everything except for full-formatted floppies and ""erased"" files (using a disk-erase utility). This edition saved me from losing valuable work on two Zip disks that were trashed on the network where I was going to school.
Overall, I gave the suite four stars because, like another reviewer, the updating routine is a major pain! On Win2000, it only took one reboot, but on Win98 it took no less than FIVE REBOOTS! C'mon, guys; there's got to be a better way! Once installed, however, it uses less system resources than it's predecessor and considerably less resources than its competition. For the price, it's more than worth it."
"One of the best AV's out there. I do professional IT security for a living and this is my recommended solution for users.
Throw in Sandboxie, Secunia PSI, and Microsoft EMET and you have a very strong security setup. Go one step further and run a Sophos UTM home version.

Note if you upgrade to KIS 2015:
KIS 2015 has an issue with Sandboxie and Google's SSL certificates. To stop the popups you can add google* to the KIS trusted sites. Just keep in mind that will reduce your security when searching on Google. I am behind a Sophos UTM, so I am not overly concerned. There is a certificate from Kaspersky you can install, but this did not fix the issue for me.  - This issue is not in KIS 2014. I think KIS 2015 MiTM's Google, but I am not sure why they only do it to them, even when I turn off SSL scanning."
"I have been a .Mac member since 2001 and an Apple loyalist since 1988.  MobileMe is one of the worst releases of software in Apple's history. This is up there with Apple's old operating system version 6.0.6, on 10/05/90, where someone forgot to include AppleShare in the final build! (Apple  corrected the problem the next day with a release of 6.0.6) I wish Apple was as responsive to their blunders as they have been in the past. My advise... wait if you can.  If you can't wait, BACKUP YOUR DATA before using!"
I thought I would be able to use personal photos with this download.  Wrong!
Reader Rabbit are the best but I can't get it to work on my HP
"I had XP OS and had to change because the system is not going to be servesed any more.  I have a 32bit system and this

was what I found that will work for me."
"There are many reviews, so I will keep this short and point out my main reasons for rating Windows 8 with one star.

1) Terrible user interface (I used Start8 to get the Start button back, but...)
2) Windows 8 will NOT play DVD movies! For most home users this is a major no-go!
3) Windows 8 removes the ability to burn DVD movie's that YOU CREATE from Movie Maker (which isn't great to begin with, but Win 7 can!)
4) Everything is designed to draw you into the M$ ""Ecosystem"" of applications rather than giving you an easy choice to use other vendor solutions that are superior. I.e. this OS is a blatant slap in the customer face and it completely M$-centric. They apparently expect the end user to adapt to their design and goals rather than giving the customer what they want.

By the time I discovered my 3rd reason, I decided to take back my tower PC with Windows 8 on it.

I WILL NOT, NOR EVER BUY A MACHINE WITH WINDOWS 8 ON IT!"
"Like many this year, I was a long time TurboTax user until all the issues with pricing and versions coming up that gave me an opportunity to look into other software packages.  I went with H&R Block this year and I'm very pleased.  Everything transferred over from TurboTax and I was able to complete all items for 2014 taxes.  I have not filed yet so will update how efile worked when completed.  I was worried that with different look and feel it would take me a while to figure out the software but was surprised how easy it was.  Everything flowed like in TurboTax tax through all areas of tax information entering and verification.  I had no issue moving around the software and in no time I know my tax exposure and can file when I'm ready.  With a price much lower than TurboTax I am glad I made the switch.  I have no reason to go back to TurboTax next year unless H&R block give me a reason to look at TurboTax again come next year."
Great program for watching DVD or Blue ray's either on your computer or using a cable from computer to your big screen tv. Love it.
Nice app
"When it has came down to computers, it has honestly been more of a essential that you do own antivirus software, not just for the protection of the laptop, but now with tablets and smartphones as a added way of communicating with the world and with others, it is absolutely a must. While there are many security software companies that do a god job, there are absolutely some that do just as good of a job, but sadly overlooked no matter what we surf the web for, or protect ourselves from damage, Bitdefender, has honestly been one of those brands that has been heavily overlooked in value, but also real security. It does a fast and reliable job at protecting the computer from malware and viruses and foreign spyware from our computers. I like it because it is fast and reliable, and doesn't take so much room against our hard drives, causing it to slow down. I sincerely recommend that you do get Bitdefender Antivirus Plus, as a must for your computer.

Price: B+

Convience & Setup: B

Overall: B 1/2+"
"Appleworks really needs a thorough overall. In the latest version, the interface under OSX sucks. Why, oh why cannot the document window automatically expand to fill the screen, and let's have a page layout view that makes sense.

Word and Excel support is very inferior, I would suggest grabbing NeoOffice J or Open Office if you need to open Word and Excel documents.

The good news is that the next version of Mac office will support xml format documents..."
"As it is not something that actually needs to be delivered physically I was able to have a look at the
questions and the content of this product within an hour. There were tons of exam questions available which is good for exams like part I as one is more likely to end up with high marks with more exposures on these mock exam questions. Also, the license does not expire as long as you do not change your computer or hard drive so that you don't feel like you spent lots of money on something that is transient. Finally, the software ie. contents get updated without additional fee. Good luck everyone on the exam"
Great product!
"I have McAfee and Spy Sweeper but recently ran into a problem where a website somehow got into my computer and started sending me messages about my computer being infected with a virus. The message said I should go to a site to get a program to get rid of the virus. Well I clicked on it to see how to get rid of it since it was getting annoying and the next thing I know my desktop has been hijacked. I was then looking at a bright colored screen that was to be frank, quite annoying.

So I went online to figure out how to get rid of the malware that was obviously causing a problem. I downloaded Spyware Doctor and it found 9 threats and over 160 infections. It did not however take out the malware. I had to get spybot (which is free but difficult to remove after you use it - it uninstalls but then you have to go into your hard drive and delete extra files) for that and it worked very well.

So if you are looking for something to get rid of viruses this program will hunt them down better than Spy Sweeper and McAfee. The only thing I did notice about having this program is that my computer started to run much slower than usual. Mostly when I'm going online I have to wait a long time for the pages to load.

As far as the scanning goes: The quick scan is called an Intelli-Scan and then there is the option of also doing a full scan. The full scan can take hours (comparred to Spy Sweeper it takes a bit longer but even a full scan on Spy Sweeper can take four hours), literally. You will want to run it at night while you are sleeping or else you will be waiting for it to finish all day.

So I'd still highly recommend this product if you want to be sure to get rid of all the viruses McAfee and Spy Sweeper don't catch. For me it was well worth the price even though I just unistalled the program. It made my computer run too slowly and that was just too irritating for both me and my husband. It could be that my computer is too old to handle this program - I've had my computer for five years now. So take that into consideration when buying this program.

~The Rebecca Review"
"I'vs used TurboTax for years. Question: When e-filing from a downloaded version, does Intuit keep a copy of my data?"
THE BOOKWORM GAMES ARE SOME OF MY FAVORITES AND TO HAVE THEM ALL TOGETHER IS SOMETHING I HAVE WANTED FOR A WHILE.  MY GRANDKIDS PLAY THEM TO AND IT HAS REALLY HELPED THEIR VOCABULARY
Im giving it 1 star because it does not work. it will start up but when I push play it shuts down.
"I purchased pc magic a year ago, and was pleasantly surprised. I renewed again because it works."
"Do not buy. It crashed several times on a plain Dell 8600. Very hard to use, like for example to set up rooms, because (1) there are no anchor points; should be able to anchor a corner and then drag a corner; (2) we cannot lock a room in place; while editing a room, another room resized; (3) there is no alignment among rooms; rooms should align sometimes, because they may share a common wall; (4) while working with a room, we cannot specify the type of wall; and so on. It has some sexy colors and menus, but after trying to use it for several times and coming out with no results, the next step is 'uninstall'."
"I had hoped this would be a simple money management tool that I could use for a small business.  Works fine for what I wanted. I was able to come up with my own catagories, etc.  The price is right and was simple to work with."
"I spent two weeks trying to get NetNanny to work on my machine, and finally gave up.  I worked closely with their technical support people, who were very good.  But after installing it and uninstalling it repeatedly as per their instructions, it still caused almost a complete seizing up of my computer.  The computer was useless any time any part of Net Nanny was installed on it.  I worked on this diligently, but finally gave up in great frustration.  Sad to say, as I wanted this software in place."
"still learning how to use it, but Ithink it looks like it will serve the purpose for me the amateur"
"Installed great, without issues on my older Compaq Preasario desktop computer. I was running Vista and except for a few programs needing to be re-installed, I did not have any problems. Now everything works great and faster too."
I was satisfied with the product last so cannot rate the new version. This year I tried downloading the 2015 successfully but did not get an e-mail with an activation code.  I tried calling the H & R customer service line and got the AI voice asking  me what my problem was and it was totally frustrating until  I used the F-word which the AI software could recognize and sent me to a human.  There was a 15 or more minute wait until I talked to a human who helped me get the code so all is well. Once I got to talk to a person the service was excellent.
"Other reviews have addressed the shortcomings in the interface. If the program worked as advertised, it would be terrific. But it is hard to use. The recover offers many versions, once for each day (if you backup daily). But amazingly, it does not show the size or date of the file you want to recover!

Forget tech support. You only get 30 days with the product, and when you do try it, the chat support is staffed by agents with less expertise in windows than a child, and less on Acronis than I have after an hour of use. Of course, they either can barely communicate)."
"Tried the Bigasoft Total Video Converter Trial from their website and it worked well.  Found it on Amazon and purchased the software.

Purchased the software and downloaded it from Amazon's digital library.  The downloaded version purchased was version 3.7.49.5044 (an older version).  The audio and the video did NOT SYCH.  The mouthing of the conversation did not match the audio.

Went online to the Bigasoft to check for their support and it said to check if it was the latest version.  The version sold on Bigasoft has a newer version 4.2.2.5198 and it looks totally different (coloring).  Downloaded the newer version/installed and now both the new and old software does not work at all.  Tried to uninstalled the older version and by going to Control Panel / uninstall software and it was not listed.

Called Amazon and they said I needed to check with Bigasoft.  Contacted Bigasoft and they said they did not sell license codes to Amazon.  Returned to Amazon and they corrected the problem."
I'm stucked in the first lessons but the program it's quite alright. Sometimes it's not very clear what you're supposed to do.
"I wrote a review the other day and have lower my star rating. After using the system for a while I find it clunky and the operation much less smooth than 2011. In addition they have taken away at least one feature that was very useful. It seems like Microsoft with windows XP and Vista Intuit has taken a good product and ""teched"" it up to the detriment of the users and the company. They should find out what their customer want be deciding what they need.
They issue with Technical support remains harsh. After a couple more calls I find the capabilities of their staff to be mediocre at best and sometimes hard to understand their their accent."
This program is not user friendly.  It won't stack PDF files.  All of the hints and help aids are for the professional version. Appears they are hinting that you really should buy the professional version. Back to Paperport for me.
"I downloaded this package online because I needed it quick, fast, and in a hurry. The install took about 40 minutes from purchase to making a spreadsheet for class. I didn't have any issues with this deleting my Outlook 2003, I just followed the prompts on the screen. (Read the entire thing, people!) My laptop is kind of old, purchased in 2006 but still runs like a champ with Office 2010 installed. I do notice that there is a longer load time but I really do enjoy the new look and functionality of 2010.

Basically: upgrading from Office 2003, I really like the 2010. It didn't delete my Outlook 2003 (I'm still using it), but it takes these programs longer to load than before, hence the 4 star rating."
Nice game.
I have bought TurboTax for many years now. I feel safe using it and I never have been audited. The price is far less then what it would cost to have it done. Since I have a business and home the program helps me through the tough stuff. I feel confident in telling folks to buy it.
I have used Quickbooks since 1999. It is a good product. It would have been more helpful if I had a better discription of the Contactor and Manufacture versions. It was hard to decide with I need at this time since we will be working on a government contract. What I don't like is that I still have to purchase the payroll updates for 200.00 a year. I would think that it could have been included with the first year.
Good mapping
This worked on my windows 8.1
"Delphi is the best all around tool i've used. You can do everything you can do in C++ and it's so easy. It's learning curve is almost the same one to learn Visual Basic. Delphi creates standalone executable without dlls, and your applications run since the first time like they are supposed to do. Ask anybody from VB to know the problems with VB.
You can create apps, web server extensions, dlls, ActiveX Objects and ActiveX dlls, Control Panel applets, your own controls and much more. You have tons of components, and you can get more tons of them for free at the web.
The standard version doesn't have database components, so you should get instead the Pro or Enterprise version, although you can import the MSADO library and use it the same way you use it at VB.
Delphi is what MS wants the .NET platform to be.
Highly recommended. It's sad that a lot of managers select VB without even considering other tools like Delphi, but if you know Delphi you will finish your projects before the others using VB and your app will run smoothly since the first time."
great
"Quicken is Quicken as it always was, except for the Quick Entry Widget.  I love this little thing (not that opening and closing the application is so hard).  This little amenity makes it easy to keep track of checks and deposits made at odd times allowing for trips to the bank website mostly unneeded."
Works great at not letting anything through as I have been using it for years. What I did notice that I did not like after a fresh install of Windows my boot time went from 25 seconds to 1 1/2 minutes after just installing this program.
"I have been a Quicken user since it was first sold, and I admit it's a great product.  I have upgraded in the past and found a lot of new bells and whistles I didn't need, plus advertising for bank loans and such which I found objectionable in a product I paid money for.  But okay, it works.  This new tactic, though, of forcing people to buy an upgrade whether they want it or not, trying to sound as though all the improvements made it necessary and that it's just too  much trouble to go on ""supporting"" the older version, is pure bullying.  I pay 6.95 a month to do my banking through Quicken and that should be enough.  It's like, after you buy your car you get an email that your car isn't going to start next week unless you pay us.  Blackmail.  I would rather go back to writing my checks out by hand and keeping my books on a legal pad than give in to this.  I'm sure Intuit doesn't care, but that's how it is."
"Do not get started with this software, I'm stuck in it. It's full of ads!!! It's adware that you pay $180 for!

Once you're out of your free help, there is no unpaid customer support, generally speaking even for bugs or problems of Intuits making.

So if you have a choice go a different route.

I'm still evaluating this, I had 2010, which worked fine, but Intuit cancelled features until we're forced to upgrade (emailing receipts and printing FedEx Smart Post labels)."
"Don't know why 365 will not open SOME Word docs on 1 of my desktops.  Only works occasionally on my Samsung Galaxy S4.  If I cannot resolve these problems, I will not renew my subscription."
"The product I received was not brand new as indicated.  It was packaged in a celophane wrapper.  I had previously ordered and received the Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 64bit (OEM) System Builder. (new).  The 64 bit system came in a sealed plastic OEM container with instructions.

Also the 32bit system arrived over a week later then the eta.  I will NOT order anything from this supplier again."
"Great tool for capturing video from your screen.  I wanted to post some of my home-grown music on youtube.  I liked the way my screen visualizations looked, but couldn't find a way to record them.  Movavi Screen Capture was the solution!  I tried a couple of freebies I found on the web, but the results were jumpy and low quality.  The results with Screen Capture are outstanding.  Movavi is worth every penny!"
The software is buggy to the point of unusability.  I would never buy this product again.
When i brought the DVD X Copy Xpress i was so happy that i can finaly make back-ups of my dvd's. But when i started to use it did not do much at all. it scaned the movie and when it came to burnin to a blank dvd not only it not burn it but it made my blank dvd useless. i even try to update it online and guess what? i made another coster i was so ticked of i just uninstall it and toss the program in the trash. i will never buy another product from 321 Studios again and i recomend to those who read this review to avoid this and all  321 Studios products at all cost.
a bit hard to use and can not print bar code
"I waited for a while before taking the upgrade to Snow Leopard for my Macbook. Glad I did, have not had any problems running my software - I use Lightroom, Steam and Dreamweaver fairly often. Also Parallels 5 works a lot snappier with this upgrade."
As a MS Certified Developer I must work in two worlds and Parallels let my MBP perform in all the ways I expect it while allowing all of my development applications to run seamlessly.
"This was a total disappointment to me. I was so excited to get this since I'm dying to learn Spanish. Does not help at all! If anyone is considering getting this, try Pimseluer. It's easy, fun and you don't have to be tied down to a computer to learn the language. It is on CD's so you can learn it in the car or while cleaning the house. Pimseluer uses conversations that you will really use speaking to a Spanish person. They also have other languages."
The product was delivered when and as promised.  The product was new and unopened as indicated in the listing.  I will purchase additional products from this vendor and company.
I've been using this product for websites for almost 5 years.  It's easy to use and let me do what I want. The computer I had it on got killed by a virus and the tech service helped me get my serial number and registration code so I could run it on the replacement. Who does that?  Nice to know someone understands what customer SERVICE is all about.  Grade: A.
"Have used it for years and keeps my network clean.  Although I also use a maleware program and it tends to find somethings that kaspersky doesn't find.

Overall great product!

Have my whole family using Kaspersky Pure."
"Ok so in November of 2000 I got my first computer not knowing anything much about computers back then I got a Gateway 900mhz with an Amd Atholon processer and guess what it came with Windows Me. The sales person was boasting all of this bull**** about how much better it was than windows 98 and yes I bought his bull**** story and got the computer for 1200 bucks. Ever since then I have always had probelms with it it would freeze up a lot and I would always have to use the control alt delete feature to get it working again and sometimes I would have to shut down the computer manually to get it to work right. One day my printer stopped working and I was on the phone for like an hour with the tech support and couldn't get it to work. Since then I haven't had a printer. And then about a couple of weeks ago I bought an HP psc 2355 printer and it printed and it copied but I couldn't get it to scan!!!!!! And I couldn't get any of the printing software to work!!!!!!!!!!!. I was so frustrated because when I called hp and talked to their tech support I was on the phone for f***ing two hours and still couldn't get it to work even the guy from hp said the operating system sucks. So then I took it back to Wal-mart where I bought it from and got my money back. And then I went to best buy and got me an epson 4600 all in one and the sales guy from epson told me that it would work with my system and the sales guy from best buy told me it would work. And when I got home and tried the printer it would copy but it wouldn't print or scan and if I turned my computer on with my printer on it wouldn't boot up to the desktop I kept getting all of these error messages. I couldn't call tech support because it wasn't toll free so I tried reinstalling the stystem and reinstalling the software but it was doing the same thing and even worse to where the computer wouldn't boot up at all the computer wouldn't shut down at all with out turning off the surge protecter so as frustrated as I was I went back down to best buy and got a refund for my printer and talked to somebody from the geek squad and they asked them to diagnose my system for probelems. The guy said well....it would cost sixty bucks but he said honestly it would be a waste of time he told me that I should put that sixty bucks toward an upgrade to windows xp so I took his advice and I did, but I had to pay one hundred bucks for the software and sixty for the installation but it was worth it my computer is running better than ever before, even though I haven't bought another printer yet, the tech guy said it would work for sure. So in conclusion if you don't want to go through what I went through don't get windows me get XP. Me is fore more errors."
"It functions as designed. I just wish they would allow you to completely delete books that already been read. Maybe put them in their cloud instead of clogging up my app.
I would also like to see a regular :book shelve look. Just like in the library where the book ends would only show instead of the whole front of the book.
As it is now, I have to scroll down a long ways to get to what I want if it is not the current reading."
I buy one every year and it does the job
"A lot simpler than i thought, however got the upgrade to photokey6 more slider options for editing enhancement"
"read the comments on how to set up and yeah, you'll be set. it works fine and i got it way cheaper than i would have normally."
"Easy to use,  would RECOMEND to a friend."
"Easy and very informative.  Great feeling of confidence that taxes are filed correctly.
Love the e-file and that tax return is directly deposited into account. Tried H&R block this as it was new to me. After doing my taxes once with H&R and then with Turbo Tax, I received a higher return with Turbo. I am sold, again for the 7th year in a row."
"Would not install Outlook.  Contacted Microsoft and, of course, was connected to a foreign speaker.  I was advised that I had to purchase ""software security"" at a cost of $199. annually or they would not help me.  I contacted Yahoo and was advised that I had to purchase the same security at a cost of $199. for life subscription.  Amazon Tech Support attempted to help but were unable to.  Am not sure what's going on but it is scary to have to become puppets  to large companies such as these  (Microsoft & Yahoo) if they support this type of behavior.  Returned a HP 24"" all-in-one which I sincerely wanted.  Will now reluctantly try Apple.  These large concerns will take down the internet with their greed."
"Very easy to use, lots of clips and templates.  Loading glitch won't let disc 3 load, have to use program with disc 3 in the CD tray.  Otherwise very happy with the program."
"I have used this product in the distant past and liked it. I decided to download it to my current computer and was unable to. All the technician programs to check my computer did not work and there was no one on the chat or hotline for McAfee to help correct this problem.  If you are looking to buy this, buy the disc version."
"I believe I will learn Spanish with this product. I tried books and cassette tapes.  They were confusing and boring!  Fluenz is the answer!  I just got started and KNOW I am going to become fluent in Spanish ... finally.  Thanks Fluenz, your method works. Each session flows right into the next.  I am really comfortable with this and will stick with it."
to expensive...to limited
"I am unable to connect to the majority of my accounts.  I cannot pay bills from Quicken.  So basically my bank account has more use than Quicken.  Actually started using Mint.com, which is also Intuit - but FREE!  It connects to the majority of my other accounts and EASILY allows me to set goals and put my transactions in categories.  Love Mint - Hate Quicken!!!!!!"
"I do not have a count, but I have used Turbo Tax for a good many years and have never had a problem.  Used in conjunction with Quicken, Tax time is not a pleasure, of course, but it is a task that I can approach with confidence."
"Don't waste your money! These guys offer very little bang for your language learning buck, and they don't even cover cultural or grammatical components. Stay way."
"I downloaded this software from Amazon.com and installed it within a few minutes. The setup is painless and the software prompts you for all the necessary information. As different software programs on your computer attempt to access the internet, Norton Internet Security will ask you to give or deny permission for internet access. The combined virus software also works great. It automically downloads and installs new virus information. It quickly scans incoming emails without interfering with the funtionality of Outlook. You can also set it up to scan outgoing email. This feature is a bit annoying but is easily disabled. When a virus is located, the program takes the necessary action and provides you with the option to obtain more information about the virus. All in all a great product!! I also recommend downloading the software directly from Amazon.com. That way you can be up in running in minutes and save on shipping costs."
"Had Print Artist. Managed to print two cards in almost a year. Hallmark is more like Creat -a- Card.

After using this for a year or so I have found I can import photos into a card but only with their borders, most of which clash with my photos. I have downgraded it to three stars."
"I purchased this program because of a bug in SpyBot that did not allow it to complete its sweep.  Although I fixed that problem, I'm not upset at having purchased this program at all.

Spy Sweeper consistently picks up cookies and Spyware that both Ad-Aware and Spybot: S&D did not identify.  That combined with the effective Spyware shield (both logical and easy to use) make Spy Sweeper well worth its purchase price."
I had used this before and need a copy to input some old information.  It's work just fine and I received the copy in record time.
Great product
"the worst piece of software i have ever come across severely hampers performance even on a high end custom built pc, shocking is an understatement resource hungry buggy rubbish, save your money do your research and go with someone else"
ok
"I am a long time user of Quicken.  Every few years, I give Intuit a few dollars for an upgrade.  In return, I usually get a few new features.  However, this upgrade was disappointing.  The interface was changed only slightly, and I'm still not sold on the changes.  I was hoping for more flexible reports, but I didn't find any meaningful changes to the reports.  I should have waited another year or two.

If you are looking for personal financial software, Quicken is as good as you're going to find out there.  But if you were planning on upgrading your existing Quicken, save your money."
"It works OK for the price, but takes a little digging around to find features."
Great
Love this movie. Watch it pretty regularly.
Many forms missing in this one.
This is a great program. My 12 year old is loving it. He can'5 wait to learn and that is amazing!!!!!
Worked great.  Have your paperwork gathered before you start processing your taxes and follow the software steps to complete and send as listed.
"I love being able to animate vector graphics one vector at a time. The bones options make animating facial features fun. There is so much to praise about this animation software... If you can give it a try before you buy, do so. Otherwise. Just give it a go. I love it.
Mike."
"I'm speaking this review from my software that I just received about two hours ago.  It was easy to train, and quickly picked up all the technical words I use in my therapy practice.  It even picked up people's names and drug names and symptom names that I really thought I would have a lot of trouble programming into it.  I bought what was probably the original about eight years ago and it was just more trouble than it was worth.  But this is absolutely fantastic.  I got the ""preferred"", I have Windows XP. An older, crappy laptop, and I don't even have the amount of RAM I'm supposed to have to use it.  I bought it used it and and am using it with an upgraded microphone that is more comfortable and probably higher quality.  Already it's been worth every penny, and I'm so glad I got it.  I've been e-mailing people I haven't talked to in a long time because I hate typing so much. Try it you'll love it!"
"I am a teacher and I am homeschooling.  Bought this product and was very disappointed.  Lots of errors which makes it difficult for the students.  Errors in spelling, grammar, games, in all levels.  Do not recommend purchasing."
Download does not work - no help offered!
I heard and I had problems with installing the network drivers.  I eventually had to buy a separate disk to get the drivers to work correctly.  Otherwise it works great.  Beats the heck out of Win 8.
Fantastic program! Has my highest recommendation! Does exactly what I needed at a wonderful price!  Flawless operation!
"I needed an update for Microsoft Outlook to sync my Outlook calendar with the updated Blackberry Desktop Software and this filled the bill.  I could have gotten just the update to Outlook, but decided to get the suite (minus Access)."
"I've been using this software for the passed couple years.  I used to do taxes by hand (if anyone still does) this has cut down on the time immensely.  I do taxes for a couple other family members and using this software in following years allows you carry over information from prior years, making doing your taxes that much quicker and easier.  The software is easy to use and walks you through the forms step by step.  I with be using it in the future."
"From the CD box:
Everything you need to quickly create, edit, and print professional quality forms with print and click ease.

Drag and drop, with over 400 professionally designed templates, and you can change your text styles, color, and page sizes. Includes NEBS forms, math calculations, multi-form and spell checker. Windows software."
"I have been using it for a few years, and it seems to do the job for me."
"I am generally a techie, but one thing I have not made the shift to is video editing and posting  it always seemed like such a steep learning curve, so I just stayed away from it.  This software is great.  It is easy to use and is packed with tons of features.  I love it.  I now feel enabled do something I was always a bit afraid of.  If you are new to video editing but want to give it a try, you won't be disappointed, it is not as hard as you might think.  This package is great for the beginner and really lets you create cool memories.  It is a bit pricey, but the feature set is robust and makes many professional transition options easily possible that I wouldnt have the first clue how to handle if I were left to my own devices."
"AFTER ORDERING THIS PRODUCT, I RECEIVED TWO COPIES 2 DAYS APART.  AFTER GETTING THE OKAY TO RETURN ONE, THE FULL AMOUNT (MINUS POSTAGE) WAS DEDUCTED FROM MY VISA ACCOUNT.

I FELT THE DESCRIPTION OF THE CD WAS NOT ADEQUATE.  MAYBE I WILL CHANGE MY RATING AFTER I HAVE USED IT FOR AWHILE."
"I purchased this application from Amazon.  I was somewhat apprehensive about purchasing/installing Partition Commander 10 on my computer due to the mixed user comments on Amazon. I am running a 1GB PC clone, using Microsoft XP and have two hard drives. In contrast to the negative reviews by some Amazon users my personal experience with this software has been excellent. After the program installation I re-partition my first hard drive from two partitions down to one without losing any data. In addition to this first modification I also re-partitioned my second hard drive from one to two partitions again without any problems/glitches or lost data. I do feel that the user must read the instructions thoroughly and take proper backup precautions BEFORE doing any modification of their present computer software.  Thank you Amazon for offering this excellent application!"
Yep its a copy of windows 10 lol.  Was exactly what I needed.
"If you are bursting with ideas for decorating your own home or a friend or relative or if you want to just get your feet wet in the burgeoning arena of computer aided design then this is a great way to get started!

For the hobbyist, amateur designer or do-it-yourself-er this tool is for you. Professional, State licensed Interior Decorators also use this software but often opt for the higher-priced Chief Architect Interiors program just released this year; it is for the consummate professional who demands nothing but the best. But I diverge; for the price; for the ease of learning and implementing Chief Architect Interior Designer has no peers. Try it! You Will like it!

"I use to love WinDVD; nevertheless, this latest version of WinDVD has an embedded program that tracks what type of films you watch. I don't know how WinDVD uses this information, yet it is frightening to know the damage that this information could do to your professional or personal life if it fell in the wrong hands. My privacy and peace of mind are priceless. I'll have to make do without you WinDVD, sorry."
"the newest version of systemworks is a horror.  i will never buy this product again.  it get's worse and worse.  live update never completes (never had this problem with previous versions).  try to get some help - forgedaboutit.

please, don't make the same mistake i did."
so far it's working just fine... Found and cleared up a number of issues. I've got no more to say
"NOTE: I paid $70 on 12/03/15.  On 01/02/16, price dropped to $55.  Lesson, WAIT until January as the earliest you can file is 01/07 of the year which is not possible for most people as W-2, 1099 and other forms aren't available until mid-Jan & end of Feb.

I've been using this product since 1988 (DOS, 5.25"" floppies), and wouldn't want to give it up.  Overall, it is very good software with an intuitive interface, but you need to do manual traces or manually validate certain things  --  since you're buying the ""Premiere"" version, your financial situation has more complexity or special situations than the typical taxpayer.

Right now, what you get is a TurboTax ""shell"" to transfer last year's ""info data"" to the current year, plus forms which act as placeholders until finalized forms are released by the IRS. State forms are preliminary and incomplete, and they are last to be released by TurboTax, because typically, State tax codes are based off of what the Feds do.  Also, at this time, W-2's, 1099's, 1098's, etc. haven't been released, and although you can backfill them from all your 12/31/2015 statements, don't bother; WAIT until your IRS report forms are received, then do an online software update.

TurboTax evolved to a Q&A type format which remains the user interface for the past decade or so, grouping similar topics together like ""Income"", ""Deductions"", ""Taxes Paid"", etc. I think it reflects how many taxpayers think about the topics.

Previously, users have complained about the cost of State efile, and pricing structure. I haven't studied the 2015 structure, but here are the usual suspects:

(1) State efile fee of $20 -- I just print/mail-in paper and avoid the fee (many States take 3-4 weeks to process refund; when I lived in NY 15 years ago, it took 8-10 weeks). Not really Turbotax's issue as States should get together and perhaps adopt a common platform which Turbotax & HR Block can just charge a nominal fee for any state rather than the (2014) $20 to file.

(2) My complaint is the TT ""up sell"" to this 'Premier"" version to do stock/securities sales -- previously, it seems ""Deluxe"" was adequate for typical mutual fund or occasional broker transactions, but the TurboTax's ""guide"" pointed me to the ""Premier"" edition to do something that is common to many households -- kind of like paying for ""premium"" airfare ticket to use the toilet (not everyone will use the on-board toilet, but come on, don't price it to be an extra).

According to TurboTax, each version (at the ""Deluxe"" and better) has all the forms; each version vary by the ""Help"" & ""Q&A""; thus, if you feel comfortable or have a repeating return, downgrade to the less expensive Deluxe.  (If you wait to Jan., you may get a step discount anyway).

Admittedly, while there appears to be rising SRP, the actual selling price seems to be just inflation indexed, rather than real increases (unlike my cable & cell phone bills) -- I'm skeptical about the ""more features for the same money"" explanation.  As of today, TurbTax's website selling price is $20 higher than Amazon's and Costco's.  (If you wait to early 2106, it is likely Costco will have a $10-$20 instant rebate).

(3) Historically, price for the 2nd State was somewhat exorbitant (is it still $40 ? used to be $20) - - I needed it for several years because of relocations and cross-state situations (NY-NJ-CT is common, maybe DC-MD-VA and KY-OH. TurboTax says it's competitive, I say it's the last gas station for 100 miles so you have to buy it at whatever they charge.

In the past, I have had several issues with TurboTax, but because I won't encounter them for 2015, it is hard for me to determine if they still persist, or if TurboTax has solved them.

(1) Previously, the NY State software would default to Itemized Deduction when I Itemized for Fed filing -- in NY, often STANDARD Deduction is better than adjusted Itemized Deduction (State taxes are not deductible for State returns, and for many renters, Standard would be better). The NY State software was too dumb to do a comparison between the two. I had to do an override for several years but now don't live in NY anymore (NOTE: your state may require the same deduction election as chosen for Fed return).

Lesson: if you Itemized for Fed, manually compare your State's adjusted Itemized to Standard.

(2) I now file Form SE, and the first time using it, it would populate numbers that were VERY difficult to determine the source. It required a lot of cross checking to determine where the numbers were coming from. It seems the W-2 Follow-on Interface now has a specific question on employment by International Organizations which don't have payroll withholding.  Form SE has been working well for me for the past 3 years.

Lesson: check that earned income is aggregated and limited to 2015 FICA $118,500)

(3) For California (during 2003-09), TurboTax would NOT apply capital loss carry-forward to State taxes, and I paid State taxes on capital gains w/o offset from carryover capital losses. I overpaid several hundred $ of Calif taxes, and when I became aware, was able to file an amended return (see below). (Odd since Intuit's HQ is in Mountain View, Calif.)

Lesson: check that carry-forwards (of ANY kind, like capital loss) are also carried to appropriate State schedules, even if you confirmed it was carried to the Fed return from the previous year).

In the 2015 version, I will test Virginia carry-forward for 529 College contributions --  VA permits maximum deduction of $4,000 to its State 529 program, and carry-forward if contributions exceed annual limit (I vaguely remember in 2014 it did correctly carry forward, but I'll check.)  UPDATE: Beginning 2015 (this version), it asks YOU to input carry-forward from previous years; have to wait if it tracks & auto carry-forward to 2016 & future.

(4) Compared to versions from years ago, the software has much less ""data source"" documentation. In older versions, you could click on a field and it would send you to the field, form or info page where the data / number was transferred from. Now, you get a vague entry or help window that doesn't help to quality-assure the various numbers.

TT's ""community Q&A"" is a brilliant use of ""free"" social media --  if the software's built-in Help text doesn't help, post your question and maybe a friendly & knowledgeable person will answer.  For any ""free"" advice by non-credentialed people on the Net, trust BUT VERIFY.

The Amend Return function for States is now much easier -- I needed to use it for 3 consecutive years in arrears because of Turbotax software bugs. Beginning around 2008, the software was able to provide (for states) a function that allowed more automation to the process.

For those with mutual funds with pass through paid foreign taxes, TT makes completing the associated form easy to get the tax credit.

TurboTax in TY2014 made FATCA (foreign assets disclosure) and Affordable Health Care questions very easy to complete.  Wealthy tax filers are likely angry about FATCA but appreciate TT's ease of complying with the law."
"I never received this item. I emiled the seller but did not receive a reply. Following the due date for delivery, I went to this site to observe other ratings and noticed several negative reviews beginning around the time of my purchase. It appears this vendor no longer sends paid items to customers - so don't use him!"
"The 360 system is OK.  One gets tired of their pop-up ads though.  Specifically for driver updates by slim****ies which pops up with the 360 notice of time elapsed for system to load after one starts their computer.  This occurs every time one starts their computer.  As far as other ads, don't know, as I use an ad blocker when I sign on to the internet.  But I'm satisfied as the price was right, but 3 stares due to ad."
"Always a catch to freeware... Works..... But to make ALL features to Work, you have to buy a  subscription....  With that said, if you don't plan to spend $30+, don't bother..."
We found It a little difficult to use.
"I used to be able to ""convert"" a song from a commercial CD to a WAV file in the computer with the older version.  Newer versions only allow you ""rip"" to MP3.  This is going backwards.
Also I am not allowed to burn a DVD with WAV files.  Not much use to me.
Miguel Melgar"
"Use it every year for the last 5 years.  Easy to use, you don't need a worthless cd once it is loaded.  We just downloaded the program and it was fine for us."
"It runs without a problem and without slowing down my computer, and it seems to protect my computer as is evident by years of McAfee usage without any virus or problems"
Could not download!!!
This product is very user friendly.  It does exactly what I wanted.  I have looked for a long time for a product like this.
"Not as good as advertised, its ok in some apps."
Excellent Product!
"previously, had been a loyal turbo tax user for years.  This issue for the 2014 tax filing season of this company eliminating forms that have been in the Home & Business edition and the Deluxe edition every year is ridiculous.  Then they try and appease everyone with a partial refund to get us onto the ""right"" version of their software and then finally cave in after consumer outrage and do what they should have done in the first place.

Thank goodness for the power of the internet to force companies into treating their customers correctly.

Too bad your rating on Amazon has now tanked to a measly 1 star, Intuit."
Bad product.
"Like so many others, I had no idea I was being cheated by having functionality removed from the product since last year.  I will never use TurboTax again after this year, no matter the inconvenience, or the fact that I used it for 10 years running now.  It was great before, now...not to be trusted again."
"I contacted the publisher, and this game will NOT run on any 64 bit PC. Big waste of money. It should be noted in the description."
love this
Software was older date than my current version
Very limited usability
"There are a lot of DV editing programs out there. Some are easy to use, some are powerful, few are both. I have used Sony's Vegas software and experimented with a Premiere Pro trial, Magix, and Avid Free DV, but was very pleasantly surprised by this software. Although Vegas is easy to use, my experience was that a lot of the features are glitz and lack substance. Magix was a great editor for newbies, but was far too limited for any serious projects. Even though Avid is difficult to learn, it's a proven product. The only reason I didn't buy it was because their HDV products cost a fortune. Just can't afford them.

Canopus has been around for a while, and is famous for their acceleration hardware and quality codecs and conversion software. I had no idea how this product would behave, but with HDV editing at this price, I knew I wanted to give it a shot.

My experience was mostly very positive. Great results, minimal fuss, and powerful features. I was able to capture 16:9 HDV footage and generate an anamorphic DVD from it. It never crashed, and it did everything I wanted it to. Why not 5 stars? The documentation really could be better. The learning curve could be a bit less steep. It is best used with Adobe Encore or other DVD authoring package. The built-in DVD authoring is absolute bare bones.

I have just upgraded to version 4.0. (BTW, for at least a little while longer you can purchase version 3.0 at this price and upgrade to version 4.0 for free. Don't know how much longer this loophole is going to be open.) It will be interesting to see what they've improved in 4.0 and whether it deserves a 5 star rating."
I purchased the 4-year subscription and was unable to download it because Microsoft did not have any more code left to provide.  When I spoke to customer service they basically told me that there was nothing they could do to help me.  Then once I was able to get a code from them the documents were coming out blurry.  The software is acting as I have not download the subscription.  The problem has not yet been solved.
"I've used TurboTax for 5 years. After reading all of the horrible reviews this year, I was terrified to buy it again. However, I wasn't convinced to change to TaxCut after reading the reviews of that product. I've decided with a lot of fear to go ahead and try TurboTax anyway. The best piece of advice I picked up from the reviews was to install TT on the machine I will print from first, then install on my laptop. Even though I'm willing to try TT this year, I want Intuit to know that their brand name has fallen a great deal in my mind. I hope they respond to their customer base and fix the problems that everyone is having. Unsure about future purchases of TT."
Good programs if you need an old copy.
I am so mad!  Topics is selling this expensive product but NEVER disclosing that it will work for only ONE person.  I bought this for my two sons to study for their exams and found out after loading the product that only one of my sons can use the software forcing me to have to delay my other son and spend more money (but not with this company!).  If this product had disclosed this unreasonable limitation on the box I would not have bought the product knowing I needed software for two kids. Companies should not lie by omission to increase sales.  That is tacky and wrong! Won't buy a Topics product again!!
I have bought the Kaspersky Internet Security for the past few years and liked it. This year I have noticed more and more errors. Not sure if my computer getting too old or what. I am not too computer savy. I haven't had any major problems though. Will probably buy it again for next year.
"What else to say but ""IT'S FREE"". so far so good. converts perfectly."
"I've been using this product for a number of years (along with other NCH software). Never any problems with the software. When I needed help, I got the answers I needed immediately. Nothing but good things to say here!"
"This app keeps getting better and better.  I like the addition of the Prime Radio Stations.

Amazon Prime Rocks!!!"
"The program is old, Windows Vista and Windows 7 don't like it.  The 3 and 5 year old enjoyed it for a few hours total (over several days).  It has some educational value, but I was hoping for more and better.  I am perplexed that there aren't better programs for sale for early education (this is one of the best I could find, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1)."
I have carpal tunnel syndrome in both of my wrists and I wouldn't be able to work if it weren't for this thing! The dragon is easy to train and learns quickly.  I especially like that the dragon has the capability to read your sent e-mail to become familiar with names and phrases that you use often.  I typed this review with the dragon.  What do you think?
this product is not free. the title should change.  i uninstalled it immediately after seeing that you have to pay $25-30 to activate.
"Tried many products as IT person over the years.  Always come back to Norton.
Simple to use, reliably works.  Does what it's supposed to do.  No bloatware."
"I was impressed by the improvements made in Visual Studio 2005 over its predecessors.  I have found C# support to be quite good, and web development sees to be also one of the best ones that I've tried.

However, for Java, C, and C++ development, it is light years behind its competitors.  I have had excellent success with Eclipse for these three languages -- although Eclipse has not been that great with C# support.  Regardless, I have found that Eclipse does put VS to shame in some of the most basic developer tasks, and I find that my hand motions are much more pronounced when I develop in VS (more clicking, etc.)

Overall, VS is still a nice product, although I am starting to question whether it's really worth all that money for C, C++ development."
Turbo tax does a good job of leading you through the process of figuring out your best approach to your least required tax
"I recently made the switch ove5r to Linux, and I have to say, after trying other distributions I  have fallen in love w/ SuSE !!  Very comfortable operating system once you get by the wind0ze stigmatism! It gives you you're office, multimedia, and graphics  packages as well as games for those who enjoy gaming.  I highly recommend it, just have patience and you'll be amazed at what Linux (GNU) has to offer!!

Monti-

Las Vegas

SuSE Happy!"
"bought did one at best buy, d id not work, bought a download from you and did not work, finally had to do it thru turbo tax to make it work"
This program downloads fine what I had a big trouble with was my os. My iMac is over 2 years old so the os was different. After the upgrade it loaded fine. But the actual quickbooks is pretty confusing at first. It took me a week to get the hang of it
was a fake copy and it erased the old windows off my computer ...rendering my laptop useless
"Intuit's decision to eliminate Schedule D from the Deluxe tax package is shabby, rapacious capitalism at its worst.  The suggestion that the customer provide a write-on Sched D to be mailed with the eCopy submission is laughable and patently absurd, no doubt the product of some wet-behind-the-ears B-school wizards whose sticky fingers have successfully poisoned the well and lost my business for this year.  Fortunately there are other vendors."
My husband received this for Christmas and has had no problems updating from Quicken 2007.  Would recommend.
"EB own words: ""Unfortunately, at this time the Britannica software is not compatible with Windows Vista. We are working on developing another version of the 2007 software that will work on Windows Vista and we are planning to release this version in the upcoming months. Please check back with us in another month or so and we should have some more information about the Vista-compatible software. But, it is entirely possible that we will not have Windows Vista compatible version of the 2007 product available and that we will wait until the development of the 2008 software."" They do NOT offer a reasonable on-line subscription."
Really couldn't get it to do what I wanted
"Of course when you buy these kinds of programs, unless you go with the high end versions you will never get what you are hoping for - but in the case of Better Homes and gardens Home Designer Suite 7.0, you get a decent enough tool that works well enough.
I was hoping for better texturing, better overall visuals, a better library of furniture and fixtures, etc.  But this suite will do its job in helping you visualize the layout of your home, or for a remodel.
The program is not the cleanest to use, and can be frustrating at times - but I have not used too many design programs (including AutoCAD) that are not frustrating at least at times.
So in closing, this product is ok but don't expect it to be picture perfect or to be too flexible."
"It has all the ""bells and whistles"" but it can be overwhelming. I use it to manage an apartment building. I have a book specifically for apartment owners which makes it less intimidating.  With all that said, it can do ""everything."""
"A word of caution: I upgraded my PC to Win XP and now my National Geographic software is useless. Neither the complete 109-year magazine collection on DVD nor my 8 CD collection of maps will run under XP.
Borderbund won't even discuss it; they foist you off on some third-party entity who says ""sorry"", but there are no plans to provide a patch or anything.
So go ahead and buy it if you're not planning on upgrading to XP."
"Before I bought this product, I read a lot of reviews about how horrible the Mac version is.

Well after using it, I've had no problems with it whatsoever.  My accountant only has the windows version and we are able to communicate and share just fine.

Just like any other software, most of the world has the PC version, but if you prefer to use your mac, then by all means, get this version."
Too many additional fee options. Otherwise it's ok. Not as easy to use as Greetings print shop.
I've been using Norton now for over 3 years and it has never failed to protect my computer against virus or intrusions. Works well on Windows 10 platform.
"A pretty good product with a word of caution. It finds a lot of what it calls unused registry items, I am not sure whether it references the line item or how often it is used but, it removed some part of my network printer driver. I re-installed the driver and ran the cleaner utilities separately and I have not had any trouble since. Good product but pay attention to what it is doing."
"First of all, this program no longer has a 3 computer limit.  You can install this program on all non-business machines within your household.  You should go to independent reviews/comparisons and also to the Iolo website before you purchase and not simply rely on the Amazon reviews.  Amazon reviews are helpful but rarely give a full picture on any product.  i.e., 3 computer limit does not apply to the newest version of this product.

I run System Mechanic version 10.1.1 on 3 HP laptop machines using XP (2gig RAM, 150GB HD) and Vista (3GB RAM, dual drives of 250GB and 100GB HD)in 32bit and Win7 (4GB RAM, 320GB HD) in 64bit versions.  After reading the negative reviews I was prompted to add my opinions and observations.  My XP was old and so cluttered it had become practically useless.  My XP has at least another year of life due to the decrease in boot time and file retrieval.  Not theoretical platitudes...real world and very noticeable observation.  My Vista and Win 7 machines were already quick and are quicker now after installing System Mechanic 10.1.1.  You see, in addition to fixing and compacting the registry, it also has a new defrag feature of the HD that helps files load in an order faster than a simple defrag will do.  Yes, I have tried various other registry ""fix"" programs and all seem to help somewhat but never fix all issues.  Likewise, System Mechanic won't fix everything and some here have claimed that it even damages their registry--I can't speak to that, I'm sure they believe their claims but that has not been my experience using System Mechanic for over 1 year on various computers.  As for customer support ... I've found that excellent customer support indicates the company has a tremendous amount of experience with dissatsifed customers.  I don't want there to be a NEED...since need indicates that the software, hardware and/or operator was faulty.  I have NOT found System Mechanic to damage anything and, in fact, it seems to do repairs better than the competitors I've tried.

I'm not an IT professional or a computer geek...I'm like most of you.  Money spent on a program should deliver what it promises with minimal effort and, for me, this product has delivered."
"Quicken 2016 is good. 2017 is better. Finally, after many years of producing only inferior software for Apple products, Intuit has begun to make financial management software worth purchasing. May it continue."
"WordPerect X5 is an office suite consisting of WordPerfect X5 (Word Processor), Quattro Pro X5 (Spreadsheet), Presentations X5 (Mutimedia Presentation), and WordPerfect Lightning  (Digital Notebook).

This review will highlight some of the features of the WordPerfect Office Suite.

WordPerfect
-----------
- QuickCorrect
QuickCorrect (called AutoCorrect in Word) is a pretty standard feature in word processors nowadays but a feature unique to WordPerfect is SpeedLinks. SpeedLinks allows you to specify a ""Link Word"" (e.g. @Amazon) and a corresponding Web address to link to (e.g. Amazon's Web address). Every time you type in @Amazon, the ""@Amazon"" will be replaced with Amazon's Web address.

- Multiple File Formats Supported
You can convert a WordPerfect file into Microsoft Word and other word processor formats such as WordStar, XyWrite, and DisplayWrite. If your document contains tables, you have to the option of converting the document into MS Excel, OfficeWriter, QuattroPro, and Lotus 123 as well.

- Frustration-Free
I used Word for many years before I gave up on it almost entirely. I usually elect instead to create my documents in a plain text editor like Editplus, copy and paste it in Word, and ten add on the finishing touches, such as underlining, italics, and bold (which a plain text editor cannot do). The reason: formatting quirks (e.g. line spacing, indentation) in Microsoft Word can be absolutely exasperating! If you use Word on a regular basis, *you know* what I'm talking about.

Word processing not only works flawlessly in WordPerfect, it is incredibly easy to incorporate, format, and manipulate tables, pictures, and multimedia. I can concentrate on creating content without having to contend with software quirks.

Quattro Pro
-----------
Quattro Pro is a full-feature spreadsheet program like Excel. However, There is a disadvantage of using Quattro Pro. Since the vast majority of people use Excel rather than Quattro Pro or any other spreadsheet programs, help resources are not as abundant as Excel. This will almost definitely not be an issue if you're using Quattro Pro for designing simple spreadsheet but it may be a concern if you're planning on designing more complex spreadsheets that involve more advanced features such as macros.

Quattro Pro is also incompatible with Excel. You cannot expect to easily migrate an Excel file in Quattro Pro and vice versa. If you're newbie on spreadsheet, my advice: go with Excel.

Presentations X5
----------------
Presentations X5 works a lot like Microsoft Powerpoint. You can easily create presentation slide shows. Presentations X5 allows you to insert pictures, sounds, spreadsheets, multimedia files (such as MPEG, AVI), and other objects.

Extras
------
- Create PDF's
New in X5 is a PDF Tool which allows you to turn any WordPerfect document into a PDF file. It can even convert image-based PDF files into editable content! Use it to add comments or mark up your PDF files. PDF files can be password-protected.

You can create high-resolution or low-resolution PDF's (high-resolution PDF's are best suited for printing and low-resolution PDF's are best suited for posting on the Web.) Note: PDF Tool is only available in the Standard and Professional versions of the WordPerfect Suite.

---
WordPerfect Office X5's forte is in its word processing program, WordPerfect. (Any wonder why Corel named its office suite after its word processing program?) I am very impressed by how easy it is to create and edit content in WordPerfect. Presentations X5 is a superb program as well. As for Quattro Pro, I do have slight reservations about recommending it to someone who uses its more advanced features, not because of any flaws inherent in the program, but because help resources are relatively scanty compared to Excel. All in all, I'm thoroughly impressed with the WordPerfect Office suite. The bottom line: if you need a word processing program and have only rudimentary spreadsheet needs, the WordPerfect Office X5 suite is definitely the way to go."
Very easy to understand. Maybe took me an hour to complete.
"I gave up on ProShow Producer because it was cumbersome to do anything with menus and its previewer crashed too frequently.  Vegas Studio has a learning curve, but is relatively straightforward after the first few movies.  Just remember to use a separate track for each video segment that needs a separate exposure or color balance filter; you can't turn one off in the middle of a track.  Menu creation is still maddening, but less so than ProShow's."
"Greasy security features, especially the virtual keyboard and an seperate protected browser page."
"This is an awesome game for train lovers of all ages.  It starts of with simple tasks, memory games, and thinking puzzles.  The difficulty increases and becomes more challenging, even for adults.  There are jobs to build your own train yard, deliver freight to their destinations, or to keep the train from crashing.  There's math puzzles, sorting skills, and even some alien invaders.  This is MUCH better than Lego's Loco."
"Did not have the maps as described.
I will not depend on an aftermarket map company again.
When you land overseas in the middle of the night, it is very uncomfortable to not have any kind of map guidance.

This is a bad time to find out that somebody sells a poor product"
"It was exactly what I was looking for, very usable though it was not the new version. Had used this software the previous year. Am very pleased."
This was such a great movie. They kept true to the original Land Of The Lost but gave it a modern twist. It's good to see Sid and Marty Krofft making movies again. This movie had us laughing from beginning to end. It was non stop action all the way through. This is a must see for any Land of the Lost fan!
Using this application will be fantastic if it allows easier navigation between pages.
It is less intuitive than earlier versions. It seems very difficult to locate specific items and schedules. I might try a different program next year.
"I made the mistake of switching from TurboTax to Tax Cut this year, and I'm so sorry I did.  Even though TaxCut had an offer with MS Money (which I often use), TurboTax works far more smoothly with Money.  I also had to hunt around for where to include deductions - for example, I have a college saving fund that is deductible for my state taxes.  I was never asked about this in the ""Interview"" and had to hunt around the many deduction screens to find and check ""Other deductions.""  This is a fairly common and fairly new deduction, and should have been specifically mentioned.  From now on, it's TurboTax for me."
"The cd version would not install on my pc. This frustrates me to no end because the downloaded version worked just fine. Kept getting the message ""wrong key code"" every time I punched in the key code supplied. I called support and they messed around with my pc for nearly an hour and then said I must have a virus or corrupted files preventing installation. That's bs because the cd version was replacing the exact same downloaded version that was about to expire. I gave the product to a friend and it worked just fine on hers. Live and learn!"
"The user interface for this software could use an update, but all in all it is easy to use and seemingly works as intended.  Plus, I was pleasently surprised at how many documents other than a will it had templates for.  I've used several of them already.  One complaint I'd have though is that when you print documents, you get so many unnecessary pages.  When creating a will for my wife and one for me, we must have wasted at least 10 pieces of paper.  Not a huge deal, but not environmentally friendly either!"
Great product for the price; worked perfectly. Recommend.
Best tax software - period!!
"Easy to use, multitude of useful forms.  I've upgraded twice since mid 90s w/o a thought of switching brands.  Primarily use the commercial lease form which is thorough yet without excess verbiage."
Great software.
We buy Norton Security year after year and have never had a computer issue.  Well defended so far.
Worked perfectly and much cheaper then on their website
"I was really looking forward to The Print Shop 2 for Mac. Unfortunately, the disc was defective and I had to return. No option given to exchange for a new one."
Easy to install.  Good vendor.
Performs as expected.
"Nice to download free stuff.
But as usual, being free doesn't mean you get a lot of choices about the quality of the product.
First off, the media player itself is not without flaws. There is a pause in the music on albums between songs, a problem that many media players solved sometime in the 1990's.
Second, its hilarious to hear more static, hum, scratches, and low fidelity than when listening to albums. These are supposed to be ""digital"" downloads, and using a high quality DAC only accentuates the low quality of the files offered in the free music.
Its asking a lot to expect 96/128 bit files, but at this point in my life time is the limiting factor, and using the time consuming low quality music files is time better used ripping my own CD collection and enjoying at least 44 Mhz WAV files for digital files.
Maybe Amazon could look at what free music a person has downloaded and offer them high quality versions for a small fee. I would be willing to consider paying for a better sounding experience."
I got this software for Christmas and I am having problem even loading the software on the computer. I am going to give it a try a couple of more times and then if it does not work it is going back to Amazon.
The product is working as promised. It came in it's original packing and was unopened as promised. I would recomend this item and seller.
Great software for the price!
"I purchased this product for my Mac being assured that it would work great with not only my Mac but also iPhone and iPad. Unfortunately, that is not quite accurate. The web features will work, however, email protection does not. The ""identity safe"" features are also not compatible at this time. Hope I will be able to get my money back from this software."
"Very poorly designed.  it searches my disk for music I have, but can't figure out which music is part of the same album.  I often have every song in a single album listed as a separate album (which makes my album list verrrry long).  The scrolling doesn't work properly.  It often doesn't always respond to the scroll wheel.  There's too little contrast between the various elements.  I used it for several weeks before I realized that there was a scroll bar in the upper right corner of the album list.  If you move your mouse pointer to the right, then the screen will auto scroll to the left because it's sure that you wanted to do something over in the right hand panel (maybe I was just trying to avoid the annoying mouseovers).  The UI was designed by someone who thought ""pretty and flashy"" was more important than ""functional"".  Rooky mistake.  Amazon should know better.  All of this would have come out with a moderate amount of usability testing."
"As already noted by other reviewers it is both unfair and bad business practice to suddenly eliminate capabilities (Schedule C interview, e.g) from Deluxe that have been there for several years without making this very clear up front before a customer purchases the item (either by renaming the product or adding an upfront statement about the change).

I've been a long term user of TurboTax but will now consider other options. They have lost my trust."
"When you get stuck the help here is non existant.  I got stuck in the passive loss carry forward amounts.  When you click the highlighted words to determine what it is talking about it says """"Passive Loss Carryforwards You will find this in previous years' tax returns, on the IRS's worksheets for Form 8582, Worksheet 5, column (b).""

Well, Column B is very obviously not the loss carry forward as it is just a multiplication ratio.  When I went to click for more help I got stuck in endless loops very obviously designed to frustrate you into searching somewhere else to get your answers. Also, in the same area they mention an alternative minimum tax, what is their description of this? Glad you asked:
If you used this program last year, this amount is the amount on the Rentals and Royalties Worksheet, in the section labeled ""Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) Worksheet for Rental Activities"", in column (5), ""This year unallowed loss.""

Similarly, the amount that appears in column (5) this year will be the response to this question for next year.

So.... what happens if you didn't use this worksheet last year.... Well I know what I won't be doing next year."
"After receiving my disc copy of this software I was so excited installing it. At first, my desktop computer works pretty well. It actually shows a good result, faster than before the software was installed. Until I realized that my 2007 Microsoft Office excel program was messed-up. The issue is, I Could no longer preview my excel document by highlighting the document which I can usually can preview the document without opening the file before. Other than that, I could no longer open the excel file straight from the folder. Normally, upon clicking the document, the file opens automatically. This time, the program opens up only but a message pops-up and says ""there was a problem sending the command to the program"". So I have to go to the opened program and click to the Microsoft icon red round button found at top left corner to drop down the file I wanted to open. The file can be open but it takes a long route process.
  I am not really sure if this mess was due to installing this ""TuneUp Utilities"" software. However I am hoping if the Vendor or the software designer could help me find the way to fix the problem to have my excel back to it's original way of operations. Due to this mess, I am consuming/spending more time than my usual way.
Please email me back what is your suggestion at ""jiringan5510@yahoo.com."
"Mozy is pretty and shiny on the front end while you are backing up your data, but when your number comes up and you need to restore a bunch of your data, they are horrible, absolutely horrible. And why should they care, at that point you are already a customer and you have no reason to suspect what is waiting for you behind the curtain when you suddenly need to do a restore of all your data. If you ever have the misfortune of actually having to restore your data from them - God help you from putting a bullet in your head after 7 days of fighting their incompetent support idiots and faulty software and disconnecting servers which will continuously frustrate you to the point of just wanting to die rather than deal with Mozy ever again in your life.

Mozy sucks more than any company I have ever dealt with and they make no apologies and there is no end to the hell they will put you through and never offer you a break of any kind no matter how long you tell them you have been fighting their broken pile of junk they call ""the restore process"". Best I can tell, they are apparently a group of evil sadists who horde your data simply for the enjoyment it brings them to listen to you toil in frustration as you try and get your data back, all those precious vacation pictures and work files and your entire music collection and bookmarks, until you ultimately give in to their extortion of paying them $250 to get your data on a $29 hard disk and just end the misery.

Google it, ""Mozy restore"" and read all the poor souls who did not know any better, their stories are all over the internet on every blog that discusses backup. Beware and go with someone else, ANYONE else, to backup your data. I don't care if you have to buy a new hard disk every month to keep it from crashing, it is better than dealing with Mozy on doomsday - `cause they got nothing but a pile of misery waiting for you.

Consider yourself warned, don't cry about it later and say you didn't know any better. Now you know."
"When I review a McAfee product, the first, and the only important question I have is whether it would slow down my system, like their older versions. Unfortunately, before now they all did so. However this is the first McAfee product I can actually recommend without reservations.

As others have mentioned, you basically get a card with download instructions. After a simple setup (Forget the Windows 8 metro control center, but get the real thing), you get a nice suite of Internet protection applications for your PC.

I never had issues with the functionality of McAfee products - just their speed. So this works as a nice combination of a family filter, firewall, and of course an anti-virus. And being able to manage your mobile security with the same suite is a great bonus. You can track four phone, remotely lock it, or even wipe the device if lost. There is also identity protection, but I never trust those products. The best guardian of your identity is yourself, and unfortunately no technical solution can prevent social attacks (hi, this is your bank calling, can you hand over your ssn?)

Anyways, overall this is a fast, easy to use suite that comes with modern and clean looking applications. For the first time I am recommending McAfee with no reservations."
"Installing software generally does not go as easily as the software company makes it seem. If you have good eyesight and plenty of light, you should be able to do this. Lacking these two elements, I missed the protion of the screen where you are supposed to type in the registration. You can't go back and type in the number and fix it so you end up with a 30 day trial - not what I wanted. Vipre's customer service staff were extremely helpful and had my error fixed in very little time. So far no virus problems on the computer."
"So easy to use! That's the bottom line....not only are the features easy to learn (with good tutorials), it converts all of your older documents to being Office 2007 compatible! I needed to do a power-point presentation for my Master's Thesis, and Office 2007 made it easy and hassle free! I am incredibly happy with this product and would reccommend it to anyone who needs to create products for use in school or office presentations."
"First, package was delayed three days.  I ordered the ""product key"", which I thought would contain a CD ROM, too.  It doesn't - you STILL have to download... I fail to see the point in snail-mailing an activation card in the first place.  Once I installed, and typed in the activation key, I was told that there was some sort of problem activating.  I called the automated phone number and followed the directions for entering this god-awful string of numbers in the phone.  After the time spent on the phone, I was told that it STILL cannot be activated!  Now, I'm wasting time trying to contact support, etc.. Been waiting for 30  minutes now... just to get a word processor to work!  Had better luck in the 1980s.  I wish I could spit in their faces - I'm so sick of badly designed software and hardware form ALL of these companies!  They seemed to have forgotten about the users quite some time ago - years ago... Now, they're just shoving crap down our throats... and we still swallow it all."
Consistently great software.  I have used it for 5 years!!!!
I like it
"Does the job very well, good product and properly packed.

I used it several times. No tricks and simple setup

I do recommend it"
"Recommend buy, ease to use and better than bitdiffender. (note: make sure you totaly remove old anti software that you had on your system, even though you removed it. It will still leave some of anti ware on your hard drive.  KasperSky will lead you to their removal site.)"
Great data!
Still need to work out some kinks but worth the $
My kids liked this.  It isn't their favorite game of course but they use it at school and it is a fun way for them to have some educational time at the computer.
"This product has slowed my computer down to a crawl, and has caused programs to remain in task manager after exiting. (I have a relatively new dual processor machine with 2 gb of RAM.) Furthermore, Norton says that this software can be installed on up to 3 PCs. However, when I try to activate it, I get a message that the second machine where it is loaded has exceeded the number of allowable installations. When I look up my account on the Norton site, it says that I can have the software on up to three machines. To fix this problem, I have to find my proof of purchase, mail in a form and the receipt, and they will get back to me in three weeks after deciding if I have exceeded the installations. What am I supposed to do for virus protection until then? This product is a class action lawsuit waiting to happen. I'm switching to McAfee forever."
Excellent. Exactly what I needed
always used it ...now it doesn't work with latest version of windows 10.....
Great product.
"turbo tax never disappoints.  it really is that easy.  answer the qs. follow the prompts.  its exactly what the other person behind the computer is doing. except turbo tax is ~ $50 vs $250.  if your taxes are simple, single, married, rent or own a home, job, family, little retirement, etc etc.  maybe you should look into turbotax.  if its complicated, maybe not.  oh, don't forget the state taxes are extra, like 20 bucks. I know that already from previous years, so add 20 bucks to whatever your total is."
I bought Windows 8 and hate it on my desktop so I put it away for a couple of years maybe. Windows 7 is the best and I feel very fortunate to still obtain a copy. Support for Windows 7 from Microsoft from what I found will be fine until the year 2020. I love it. Thank you
"Although this little nugget does not appear on this page, you can not use this disc to upgrade an existing Vista Home Premium installation without doing a full reinstall.

Update 10/29
There is a non-supported way to make this upgrade work for people who have Vista Home Premium... If you are interested, check the comments to this review.  It worked for me, but your mileage may vary.

Because there is this way to make the upgrade work, I have increased my review from 1 to 2 stars.  Please note that this low score is not a comment on the quality of Windows 7 once installed, as I have been happy with the improvements thus far and it seems to be a quality modern OS.  The score rather reflects the arbitrary block to upgrading in place for Vista Home Premium users and the lack of adequate advance disclosure of this limitation on the part of Amazon and Microsoft."
I've used quicken for years and like the upgrades this has.  Happy to continue using quicken.
"I have had Webroot AV for years, the protection is awesome and the other features they don't talk about much. I think its well worth the price to keep your mind at ease when surfing."
It worked and customer service was very helpful and responsive but the end quality was horrible. I ended up trying the Elgato and it worked and looked great. Get what you pay for I rekon.
This product is full of bugs. Very disappointed.
"One of our favorite anti-virus products. As other reviewers have stated, it is relatively unobtrusive and doesn't slow your PC down like other programs tend to."
Not easy to navigate The previous years were better
It worked
Wunerful.
"This program stinks!  I don't need to go into detail, becuase the review above says it all.  After 5 yrs with Quicken, I am going to take MS up on the free 60 day offer to try Money.  Either way, I am never buying a Quicken product again."
"I bought this primarily to convert my wedding video to DVD to save it long term.  The default is 'best quality' but the resulting DVD quality was much worse than the original VHS played on a VCR.

I'm returning this item and will just send off my video to be professionally converted for $20.  It takes about a month but if the quality is the same as the original VHS then its all worth it.  Will write follow up review to compare professional conversion vs this product."
"I use Turbo Tax every year and I e-file using the Federal and State's filing services (which are free or minimal cost). This year when I was reviewing Turbo Tax's information while going through their e-file option I somehow activated the process for them to do the e-file.
I was perusing their e-file process to find out the costs and any special requirement or information they may have in order to compare it with the two government tax sites. I don't know how it happened, I thought I ended the program before the final option of activating the process. It turned out to be very expensive, almost $70. Half of that goes to Turbo Tax and the other half goes to a bank that actually collects the returns and then they take both fees out before forwarding the remainder of the returns to my bank.
I use Turbo Tax every year and this was the first time this happened. The calls I made to Turbo Tax and the bank were for naught. Turbo Tax people basically said their program gives warning before the e-file choice is activated, and they discounted my assertion of how it occurred.
Bottom line is USER BEWARE.
I would like to see advice on filing and ways to maximize deductions, but I suppose that is what a tax attorney or CPA is for."
"This is just what we were looking for!  It's not the same as the green (or orange) and black screen that I had in school as a kid, but it's definately fun....and addicting.  Both my husband and I have had our fair share of playing this game....and the kids love it, too.  Would recommend.  It's a great learning tool for money management and responsibility!"
So boring I almost died.  The letters blur together after a short while.  I'd return it if I could
This was NOT as advertised. This is not software. This is just a bunch of files for some sort of training and is not represented by Amazon like this at all! I feel ripped off. There is no setup of any kind. Absolutely worst I have ever purchased from Amazon. I really am loyal to Amazon but this was NOT right.
Purely amazing. That's all I need to say.
Works as specified
A continuation of Quicken's good program.
"This was my first year filing married.  I'd used Tubotax for almost 20 years filing single.  Problem:  the MFS vs. MFJ calculation should be a lot easier and more intuitive than it is.  For a lot of couples this is a must-do comparison to make sure you are getting the best refund, any tax accountant was trained from day one to do this.  I had to call Tubotax, which was a nightmare, and their employees did not even know what MFS vs. MFJ even means!  I found myself talking to a few ignorant and poorly trained employees who knew very little about the product, they thought I was asking for tax advice when I was actually just asking how to use the product.  Finally got a supervisor who knew something, but I'm still not sure the MFS vs. MFJ comparison was done properly even with her guidance.  Will probably use something different next time."
"I have been transferred to 3 different departments and sent to a forth. However, the third department told me the software was discontinued and support will also be discontinued in the near future, if not already. Judging by the number of transfers, I would say support is difficult to impossible now, if available at all (I gave up before trying the 4th. department)."
"I've used turbo tax to prepare my taxes for the last seven years. Not any longer. They've substantially changed the way they charge for printing multiple returns, effectively guaranteeing that anyone filing more than 1 return will have to pay substantially more than before. This is not about 'improvements' or 'features.' It is all about corporate greed. I can completely understand corporations needing to increase prices a reasonable amount each year; that is just good business. But jacking prices through the roof and then hamstringing their core users with their sick new pricing scheme for each additional return filed is GREED.

Turbo tax has lost themselves a customer. I'll be pursuing other avenues to file my taxes this year."
"As a contractor we have been using Quickbooks Pro for about 14 years now.  Very easy to use and can easily get questions answered just by clicking on the ""help"" button.  Highly recommend this software to any company to keep their finances in order."
"Does what I expected.  All the forms seem to be back this year!

I've been using TT for 20 years.  It's really handy if you use TT year to year, since it imports previous years tax returns and brings all information forward.  It reminded me that I had a passive business loss carryover from last year.  It knew that amount and populated the correct form.

Would definitely recommend!"
"I think alot of the people writing these really bad reveiws on Me , have not taken the time to learn the solutions to there problems within ME. Using your MSCONFIG to adjust your startup and eliminate programs you don't need running at startup , is a good start. Increasing your RAM , makes ME much more stable , a inexpensive upgrade thats good if your a gamer or use alot of graphic editing software. When I frist recieved ME preloaoded on a new system I purchased I was about to switch to 98 . However after the RAM upgrade , adjusting the system config utility I have yet to have a problem with Windows Me since !"
"I was able to take all of my financial data from many former versions of quicken and quickbooks and import successfully and with no hassles to Pro2014. Love it. Easy to use, easy to understand, easy to manipulate as necessary. Download was quick, installation was easy. Wish everything in my world was so uncomplicated!"
I've used this program since CorelDRAW! 2.0 in 1991 and each version just keeps getting better and better. It does everything a vector program should do.
"Doesn't work on my MAC! information for which platform is needed is not clear.  3 different spots say different platform requirements. A pop up warning before buying it said mac os x 10.5 or higher, another place says 10.6 and another says 10.6.8. And with amazons no refund policy this leaves me with wasting my money. this definently makes me want to stay away from amazon for software downloads! Just wish amazon could trust their customers when they say a program doesn't work so that they could refund people!"
"I have owned Algebrator for about 3 years now, and the more I have used it, the more disappointed with it I become.  I will give you an example of a problem it cannot solve:

Find the zeroes of the following polynomial function:  3x^4+7x^3+69x^2+175x-150

I should be able to plug this equation into Algebrator and it should be able to find the value of x when the equation is equal to 0. Instead, however, when I click the Solve button, I get the following error:  ""Unable to solve equations of this type""

What the heck?

The zeroes, by the way, are -3, 2/3, 5i, and -5i.  It did not even find the zero integer -3!  When I typed this problem into the Mathway.com equation solver, it at least gave me the -3.  It didn't give me the other zeroes, but it did give me at least one of them.

This is just one of the many disappointments of Algebrator.  If you purchase this for College Algebra or Precalculus, you will be disappointed.  It's great for prealgebra, elementary, and most intermediate algebra problems, but when you try to use this to solve more difficult problems, you will be irritated when it tells you it cannot solve those types of problems.  If you know how to do the problems and you need a self-check, I would recommend Mathway.com.  It will solve most math problems, and it's free, as long as you don't need step-by-step solutions.  By the way, I am not affiliated with Mathway.com in any way."
"The software is pretty good for what it is intended for.  It doesn't give as much control as I was hoping.  Mostly I work with much more advanced software that gives much more control but is much more time consuming.  If you just want to make a nice video from your latest family vacation, this might be the best way to go.  No serious glitches."
"Much cheaper than renewing on McAfee site.  Other reviews have people complaining about not knowing how to use the enclosed code to upgrade, but I had no problems at all.  Installed easily and working great.  I'll be back to buy this again same time next year!"
"Installed easily and appears to be working w/o major problems.  Good security blanket for converting from PC to Mac, but finding that most files can be worked on Mac programs.  Excellent pricing from Amazon."
CAUSED MY COMPUTER TO RUN SLOWLY.  I HAD TO REMOVE IT.
"The order arrived in good time and was in great shape.  It was very easy to install.  I was surprised that the installation did not absorb the Hallmark Card Studio that I already had on my computer.  So, now I have two versions of HCStudio on my computer."
Excellent item
Yet to be seen how the product works as always I am sure they will charge a fee to e-file state taxes.
"turbotax deluxe indeed has changed in terms of non support of schedule c,S and E form. I was extremely frustrated when I found out that if you want to E file you couldn't do it unless you upgrade to premier product and shell out extra 30dollars. This was totally unfair on part of Intuit.
I had written to bob meighan,v.p of turbotax, and he was kind enough to upgrade my deluxe program as a courtesy. He correctly pointed out to me though, that description clearly states that investment section can be entered manually. So, we all need to acknowledge that fact. However, now I am satisfied that they acknowledge that there is big uproar of this issue,particularly not be able to efile if data are entered manually for schedule, C.D.E. He is looking into that situation of alowing efile. Although, no committment were made about that.

For me, I will now stay with upgraded turbotax premier version(courtesy of intuit) this year. I will monitor situation as to what they plan to do about turbotax deluxe."
constantly get an error message stating some sorta bug  refuse to load. I tried loading it more than once on my system . I tried the 2014 evaluation  version and that worked for the 30 Days
"Great buy  Works on up to five, that's five, of your computers for one price.  $10 per computer???  Where can you get a bargain like that these days.  You likely spend more on lunch at times!

Very fast applications.  Cleans up and sends a report to in box.  You can instantly see whether you have malware, threats, or other gremlins that are affecting your computer(s).  The fact that the support team is American, and their first language is English, means a great deal since yhou don't have to struggle to understand a person whose can't speak the English language well enough for you to understand them clearly. I love foreigners but when I need help, I can't sacrifice my admiration for their culture at the altar of my PC requirements.  Concentrating on your computer problem is stressful enough, but to have to also concentrate on the sjupport team member's language is quite distracting, and sometimes very frustrating, at the least.  This is NOT the case with PC Matic.

Get PC Matic, you won't be sorry."
"it worked great and cleaned up my laptop from a threat---did total check-up of system.
until now,i have no problem ."
Best cleaner around
"I am a disabled machinist/ mechanic, and I miss the trade terribly, but with this humorous puzzle game I am able to tinker, if only virtually. This is a lighthearted brainteaser. If you enjoy playing with gears, pulleys, explosives then this game is for you. A++++"
"This is the worst software I have ever used, Not only is their support terrible but it takes exactly 10 mouse clicks for every check you print. I am not exaggerating here, this software is horrible. The software poorly connects with Quickbooks and I am constantly going back and fixing check numbers that are off from what Quickbooks says the check number is and what Versacheck prints on the check.

You are also tied to using their ink and paper or you have to suffer with an additional few mouse clicks with their ""Ransom"" warning messages telling you to enter a code for another box of paper.

There has to be something better than this out there?"
"I just spoke to my 90-year-old grandmother, who installed it for her 86-year-old husband to use. My grandmother said she had no trouble installing the program and setting it up, because the instructions are so easy and clear. Her husband, who normally just uses the computer to play solitaire, has been playing the games for 2 hours a day and smiling while he does it. She says that after a week he already seems sharper. So far, so good!"
"They charge you credit card, and you can't even download it!  Funny, my Dragon 12.5 stopped working when this ""update"" came out.  Stay away from Paperport 14 too."
great safety program. Timely delivery
You know what you're gettin' with Turbo Tax and this was a good price. Nothing more needs to be said!
I am a new user to quickbooks pro for my two businesses and rental properties. I was skeptical about using the program at first because of how many individuals have told me it's difficult to pick up for a first-time user. I used to do all of my own book-keeping and receipt/expense tracking with excel and its abundance of formulas to incorporate. However when I first launched quicken pro 14 the tutorial was excellent and gave me a few tips I otherwise wouldn't have known about. As well the interface is extremely easy to use and entering information is so straight forward my 5 yr old daughter could do it.
I am new to MAC but this Office works wonders love it.
great product
"This edition of Quicken for Mac is significantly reduced in what it offers from previous versions.  They took away the ability to track investment transactions.  My understanding is that this feature is still offered for Windows users, but Intuit obviously doesn't care much about Mac users!"
As described.
"This was just right for our basic, no deductions tax return. It was easy to download forms to input income. Intuit upgraded the options but we did not have special tax situations anyway. Very satisfactory."
This has helped to keep track of exactly where our money goes both for business and for home. It will help at tax time next year. And it will probably help us save more in the months and years ahead.
Easy to use and has been for years. The only tax program I have used.
It was easy to use and the price was right. I liked the way it printed the return without printing all the worksheets and useless pages that use too much ink.
I needed to open an older tax return file and I didn't have the original software.  This review is basically for the vendor that delivered exactly the advertised product at a low price and in a timely fashion.
"...then even a thirty-year-old woman can find much to love in this game!  This is the best equestrian game I have found yet -- lovely graphics, fun competitions, (unintentionally) amusing characters, and even a mystery!  It has obviously been designed for a *ahem* younger crowd (to anyone over 13, that hunka-hunka broodin' love Mathieu becomes quite comical), but it brought back many happy horsey memories for this player.  I especially loved the eventing competitions (no dressage -- sorry purists) with all the varied locales and riding on the beach.  The mystery was fun too.  Here's a hint for those who are stuck: the cards on Christobald's bed in the beach house can be flipped through, using the right/left arrow keys; look at them closely!

Some drawbacks are: the accumulation of horses can get burdensome (it's fun to win them, but tedious to have to keep up on training them every day), some storylines do not wrap up (why does the grandfather have a laboratory?  it doesn't tie in with anything!  and why the office by the stables?  nothing ever turned up in there either!), I never found any ""hidden trails"" (the box said that I would find them), and the ending was rather unfulfilling (as several previous reviews have noted).  I never had a problem with sick horses or keeping track of caring for them, but I could see that, if the game were interrupted frequently, it could become a problem.

I'm looking forward to checking out the other ""Saddle Up"" games.  I've heard the Pippa Funnel one is rather difficult."
"It appears to work for me.  The instructions could be more user friendly.  Not all of us are techno engineers.  Plain language and definitions of terms would be great. Also the print could be larger for us old dogs.
once in a while it looses it's mind at re-boot and can't seem to re-conect.  It may be the internet or should I say Al Gore, causing poor connection."
"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.
Man, If I could give this operating system a negative 5 stars I would; this was a huuuuuuge step backwards for Microsoft; what a way to shoot yourselves in the foot. I've considered myself a loyal Windows guy up to this point, but now I'm finally purchasing a Mac. We have one at work that I've been toying with and now, I actually prefer the Mac over Windows! Goodbye Microsoft. I'm sure your marketing division is seeing a mass migration right about now."
"On installation, the phonics module wouldn't install (the error message said the installation file for that module was corrupt). Then, several of the modules would not play correctly - they kept demanding that I insert the CD even though it was already in the drive). Also, I was displeased to find that this is not one integrated product, but rather several unrelated programs all crammed onto one DVD."
Works as it is supposed to.
"I was VERY disappointed after all of the uproar around TurboTax deleting the investment income feature (Schedule D) last yearthat they back tracked on and restored for 2014that TurboTax deleted it yet again for 2015 to force people who have used that feature to upgrade for an extra $20 - $30. I'd take away more that two stars for that alone but overall the product functional and does the job.

In another area, I wish they would allow you to print out individual worksheets in the forms section. It's ridiculous to have to print out 92 pages to get one form."
"I have been working with this software program for weeks and find it to be very inflexible and difficult to use.  It takes too long to perform simple functions like placing a piece of furniture next to a wall or getting a roof line to slope correctly. The program seems to want to default locations or slopes to positions that don't make sense.  It would also be nice to be able to copy a section of one plan to another or to simply rotate or flip a portion of the plan to evaluate different designs.  All such tasks are difficult, if not impossible, to perform.  Just shoot me!"
"I educate my two boys at home, ages 5 and 6.  We've been working on learning about coin values all year, using real money.  It wasn't until they played this game that my 6 year-old has finally got it!  He can now make a plan for adding coins to get a total value.  I could see he was getting it as he's telling his brother what to do while playing the game.  I took my cue and got the money back out.  This was a great addition to what we were already doing and at a great price too!  I love the fact that the child can control the difficulty level at any time.  They know when it's too easy or too hard and can find the ""just right"" spot!"
"The product does not work. I got ripped off. Download it, installed it, and does not open at all. Amazon will not give refund because they are rip off squads. WARNING!!!! DO NOT BUY, or you will regret it,"
Very satisfied with purchase
"Bought this to make transferring info from old computer to new computer. Yay, that didn't work. The new computer has an SSD drive and PCmover wants to install everything on it, no way to delegate where things go. Customer service was not helpful. They just wanted to sell me more and more stuff. Even when I told them no, they kept trying other ways to sell me something that ""would fix the problem"". The problem was not able to be fixed. Not happy."
"I like Vista's new interface. I think the security is a big improvement. If you set up Vista on a new hard drive while maintaining your old set up, in other words dual boot, you'll be ok. I have enough software and hardware still awaiting Vista compatible drivers that I have not been able to abandon my old setup. If you have the computer skills and the patience to do as I have done, upgrade now. Otherwise wait a year or so until the compatibility issues are resolved."
"My computer had an electrical problem here in South America where I'm temporarily working and it was unusable.

I had to buy another laptop immediately and wound up with Home Basic in the spanish language.  I thought I could easily change this to english.  Not so easy!

I have to buy Ultimate at $399, $28 sales tax, $120 Colombia tax to get the backup disk, and $35 to mail it to me, making a grand total of about $572.00.  the computer only cost $750.  So I have to pay almost $600 more just to get the english language.

Hewlett Packard says tough luck.  If I had bought a Toshiba, they would have changed  the Home Basic spanish to Home Basic english at no charge.

I see no need for Vista or Hewlett Packard."
trash junk chirp is free and easier and better
I have been using the Kaspersky Internet Security program for several years and it hasn't let me down yet.  I've used other major brands and freebie programs with perpetual disappoints and hours/days of frustrating efforts to fix the problems they were suppose to protect against. Kaspersky is the company you keep!
I have spent the last year fighting this nightmare three times a week I have to shut down my computer because of hundreds of Norton pop ups. I spent $69.00 for tech support in english and 20 hours on the phone for a month and it still was not fixed i just gave up. Then they started sending me pop ups last week that they were going to just renew on my credit card after two hours I think i cracked the code to stop it but I DONT TRUST THEM. So I have now changed my credit card number. It may come down to me buying another computer just to make them go away.
LOVE TurboTax.  It always makes the taxes so easy!  Had the taxes input and filed in less than 2 hours.
"If I could give this program 0 stars, I would have. (Amazon, are you listening?) The program does not correctly run under Windows XP even though it claims compatibility; it will only run as the (administrator) account that installed it. Even Microsoft states that you should not run ordinary applications as an administrator, so I did not test the program any further. Cosmi support was unable to provide a solution to this. Worse, I discovered after the fact that it bundles the Alset HelpExpress adware package, which is installed silently along with PrintPerfect, proceeds to try downloading additional components without any notification, and which is not removed when you uninstall PrintPerfect! I.e. the adware is left on your computer. I confirmed this by examining the install package on the CD, and HelpExpress is in there. Very Very Bad."
"If you like Windows 7, do not upgrade to this garbage. It is actually a downgrade. Nobody wants a phone OS on the traditional PC. Just a cluttered, disjointed mess. Wake up, Microsoft."
"Very hard to communicate with financial institute.
You must know accounting to use this."
As aleays good product!
"Since the package no longer contains the same features as the 2013 ""Deluxe"" version and the cost is about the same, the term ""Deluxe"" can no longer apply."
"It's an ok software for fast retouching. If you need to deliver fast head shot / portrait pictures to your clients, this will do the job.

For more professional final retouching, I'll keep doing it by myself manually on Photoshop."
"I wasted a lot of time attempting to access music I purchased. This app would not accept my sign-in, it does not work. On line chat also disconnected."
"I bought the download version as an upgrade to NIS 2004, which I was reasonably pleased with. The install screwed up somewhow and I was unable to uninstall it without a LOT OF WORK. Finally, after may hours of wasted time, I was able to do a complete uninstall of anything related to Symantec, and then my NIS 2005 install worked (so far). This involved running 3 different registry editing utilities from Symantec, manually editing the registry, deleting temp files, deleting installed files, deleting shortcuts and deleting drivers, restoring Microsoft programs, etc. The Symantec web-site contains a lot of duplicate and/or conflicting information on the topic. What a mess."
Purchased this item and cannot get it to download to my computer. Tried to email seller and get a message back from Amazon saying they are no longer on Amazon platform with them.
I'm loving it
MS Office Suite obviously dominates the document creation world. This product has helped tremendously through work on my BS and into my MBA.
This game is awesome. Honestly I believe this is must have for most educational facilities. I remember playing it back in 6th grade. Sadly back then I was not a very good speller so it had errors. This game gets kids involved in screenwriting though. I think it a very good idea for english growth. It helps with sentance structure and planning and stuff. Overall though it is a good game. (even if it takes fo ever to freakin get there)
"Its been working well, and I like the fact that I can use it on 3 pc's. Thank you McAfee"
Love this program! I originally wanted Photoshop but couldn't afford it. This was perfect what I needed it for. I just wished it had vector illustration.
"Microsoft Office 2008 for MAC is still very much in its infancy.  Not only are very important tools missing from EXCEL, but the formatting is very different from EXCEL 2007 (on Windows XP / PC) such that if a workbook was designed on the latter, it will not resemble what it looks like on the MAC and will not function for anything that uses even a little of the power one expects from EXCEL.  One hopes that Office 2008 is not an example of future Microsoft products because the Office apps are the only value left at Microsoft.  It's not quite a Yugo, but it's not the workhorse Humvee we're used to paying for."
Good
The product was all encompassing. It better and has been the doing the job I bought it for. Good for me.
This version is compatible with Windows Vista!!!!We are so pleased with this product! It has been extremely usefull for the entire family. The little one's have started playing the learning games and my husband and I have both increased our wpm. I highly reccomend this product!
I have used this program for years and lost the original app...I can do almost everything you can do on the low end Photoshop.  Its pricey but I love using it.
"Program does an OK job, but it's completely and utterly ridiculous that you don't get to simply buy it and own it--they force you to buy it again EVERY YEAR.  That's a rip-off, pure and simple."
Been using it for 5 years and it has always kept my laptop clean. No complaints.
"I used this to renew an existing Office 365 subscription and it worked fine.

I had to connect to a US based VPN to activate the product initially and again for renewal a year later. It's not designed to be activated outside of the US.

Once the activation is complete it can be downloaded and used without VPN access."
"Very disappointed. Have never had so much trouble downloading updates. Constant error messages. Even when I used a manual update link, each time I would try and finish a return, it would say I had errors in the return. Sure hope they get their bugs out before 2015. This year was really bad."
"One of the more frustrating parts of using Punch is plant selection. One has to select from pictures that are scrolled down the right side of the screen. Down in the lower left hand side of the screen is the name of the plant being displayed. One should be able to type in the name of the plant and have the picture displayed, rather than the other way around. The database of plants, while seemingly large, is quite sparse, and is especially weak on native plants, which are of increasing importance in contemporary landscape architecture."
I love having my kindle on my computer and laptop and cell!~
"I've used antivirus software from about a half dozen other manufactures. All in all I think ZoneAlarm's is one of the best if not the best. I've been using it exclusively for the last two years and all of my computers (wife's, kid's and mine) have all been virus free. The few times my wife had picked up a virus on the web or email ZoneAlarm caught it and dealt with it right away. I've read others remarks about ZoneAlarm being a pain but I don't know why. I've been using it headache free on my Windows XP and Windows 7 PCs (I've never owned Windows Vista)."
"It is OK, it does not give the detail that I wanted.  However it tells you where your children have been such as Kizi game site and the time spent on line."
"Please read very carefully the note that indicates that this product only works in the US. I live in Ecuador and I can not use it. Apparently, I can't get a refund either!!!!!!"
:)
It helps me to open files very easy. And it is easy to install i love it thank you for your guys proving this service
"I love this software!
It works perfectly on an HP laptop with a Centrino chip.
Older Pentium 4 I have tried don't have all the fxns- usually sound does not work.
I think the concept behind Ubuntu is something everyone can support.
(except Microsoft/Apple employees, maybe)"
"If you are standalone then you have nothing to worry about.  However, if you are on a network and have UNIX machines, there is a really nasty bug with NFS.
Our RH machines actually brought a switched network to its knees.
RedHat as to form said to get the next release."
The tools available for free on this version aeeexcellent
"Hi, I've been a Quicken user since the old DOS days. Frankly I really don't see any user advantage from the 2013 version I've used. I see a huge opportunity for hackers to hack into my smartphone and clean me out so none of that for me!

When a look for old data with multiple files; many checking, savings accounts and investment items the older items 20 years plus is still there
but the find/report function can't find what I know is there. For example,  college costs from 15 plus years ago can't be found. All payees are Ohio State, OSU or something like that. Two sons went 2 years and nor much is available according to quicken."
A fairly quick download and works great.
"It doesn't work on my new mac with OS X El capitan 10.11.1
Get error message: ""TurboTax Deluxe 2010 can't be opened because its from an unidentified developer""

Amazon doesn't appear to have a facility for returning downloaded product????

HELP"
"I like the software. It protects all my devices as advertised. The password manager is glitchy, I wouldn't advise using it. I use Lastpass instead."
"Delorme FALSELY states that GPX file export is available.
Sure it is.. but it does not work.  The flle comes up blank.  The input function works OK.

I like the features of the Map as usual,, I have been using the 2001 and 3006 versions for 13 years."
This DVD covers all the aspects of PSE 12 and makes learning much easier. You can choose which categories you want and go over them as many times as needed. Very happy with it.
"The delivery was on time, the disk its self was in perfect condition, install was a breeze, still trying to get used to windows 8.1 vs. windows 7 but so far I like it."
Don't waste your money...this isn't worth it if it was Free !!!!
"Received it today. It's beautifully written, and I am really getting a lot out of it."
"Very high quality piece of software. I don't have a touch screen but it is still very easy to use and to hide touch optimized stuff if you want. Of course for some people it may be hard to figure out, but I wonder how do they find the PC power on button in the first place.."
"I used TurboTax for the past two years. After reading the review about TaxCut, got fooled to buy this product.
My wife has only Tax Payer ID (TIN), with that the state program didn't start to work and complained SSN is not correct! Customer service says update the latest from the website, looks like standard answer, that doesn't solve the problem. They never tested this simple thing I guess. Finally I found a workaround, enter some random SSN number for my wife and proceed to State program and then come back and change the SSN. What the heck? Then what about any complex calculations? How can you be sure that it has been tested?
I crosschecked my tax calculations manually to make sure it matches before e-filing. Good news is I got the refund in 8 days, a big relief to me.
I'll going back to TurboTax, no doubt."
I've had Quicken since version 1.1 on a floppy disk. Newer  up-dates have gotten more sophisticated but more involved and at times more complicated and difficult to resolve problems. I've spent many hours trying to recover from stock data automatically entered into quicken when another I transferred the certificate of another stock to a brokerage account. I don't find it easy to get answers to problems.
Very easy to understand what is going on. Great features. Easy to navigate. Not a system hog.
Schedule D removed from deluxe
"I used this product last year and was ""very"" happy with my personal tax return process.  I was not as happy with it for my small business. It was not user friendly on any of the corporate issues!  I had to go to an accountant to figure out my s corporation taxes.  I ""would"" buy it again for personal taxes, but unless they have improved the product, I amm so so about using it for my business."
"""I have been using this security for years on my computers and it has never let me down. It is fast, does not slow me down, and is very user friendly. I would definitely re-new and recommend Webroot SecureAnywhere."""
I have been using Quicken since 1972 and have been satisfied most of the time.  I think some of the applications in the new version are a bit difficult.  I seem to be getting use to the differences.  I find problems between my bank downloads and the way the accounts are then entered into the Quicken accounts.  I have stayed mostly with manually updating.
Did not tell you that it cant work n never computers. A waste
"This is the newest version of Office, and does not require annual renewal like Office 365. It does limit you to 1 computer usage, but I think for the price it's not a bad deal. I removed an older Office version (2013) and installed this version. Installation was easy on my Windows 10 laptop. You do need to download the installer from the Microsoft website. This card basically contains the license you use on the website. Overall it's not much of a learning curve from Office 2013 in my opinion."
covered everything I needed and then some.
"TurboTax made a few errors on my taxes this year (related to a limited partnership Sch K-1 information).  TurboTax does not give you the option to edit the data directly on the tax forms.  It relys upon a ""question-answer"" data input method; unfortunately, it doesn't ask all of the right questions, so there is often no way to input the correct answer."
"DO NOT BUY! If you ever upgrade to another computer Microsoft will not recognize the Product key #s.
The reason for paying  a premium for your own disk ($249) was to avoid this hassle.
Sold by: GoodieHub"
I love it. I rarely set it down Best thing ever! I recommend for everybody!
"I bought the Dazzle DVD Recorder Plus from Fry's and installed it on my new HP desktop.  I've never been able to get the device river for the Dazzle 100 device to work for more than a few minutes before Studio either loses audio, loses audio and video, or stops seeing the device completely.  Pinnacle's tech support is very minimal so getting a definitive answer is impossible, but I think the problem is the device driver compatibility with Windows 64.  When I looked at the product specifications, it isn't clearly stated that Windows 7 64 bit is supported.  Because so many new computers are Windows 7 64, I think this counts as a very serious product defect.

Eventually I bought Avermedia's USB capture device, which works well, although I don't like the edit software as much."
"I have had Quicken for 15 years and just upgraded to 2003 version.  I have had nothing but problems with it.  I just purchased a new computer and have tried to backup my quicken files on a floppy and a cd without any success.  Though my original backup is there, I have tried to transfer and copy the
data without any success.  It will not allow me to get that infomation.  I have lost precious time in what used to be a simple procedure.  There is no helpful technical support.  I do not recommend this version at all and as soon as I can get out of it, I will go back to an earlier version."
awesome
"The download is only for windows.  I thought I'd be able to put it on the Amazon Fire it was paired up with in the sale.  I wish I'd have known I couldn't use the fire for this download, I probably wouldn't have gotten it.  I should have researched it better."
Have now tried them all. Kaspersky is great but the learning curve for machine and human is too high. Zone seems to be more balanced in that respect and the price for security is good.
"This CD is very, very basic. Very small vocabulary. It took me 2 hours to do all the excersises and they were quite boring."
I gave this as a gift. She likes it very much. It arrived quickly and in great condition.
"Despite all of Rosetta Stone's claims that it's the fastest way to learn a language, I don't think this program is the way to learn a language.  This is the only Rosetta Stone program I've tried, and I've worked four of the seven lessons (unless memory fails), and I don't think I've learned very much at all.

The thing about Rosetta Stone is that it doesn't teach grammar, you simply learn to associate words with pictures.  Many times now I've seen the picture for children jumping into a swimming pool or off a table and, while I always get that right in the exercises, I don't remember the sentence without some prompting.  And face it, that's very limited knowledge.  Rosetta Stone may help to strengthen vocabulary skills and even comprehension, but it isn't a good course for learning a language.  Use this course in combination with a program which teaches grammar -- explaining what all those little Farsi particles actually do -- and which explains the writing system (this one does not), a program like Teach Yourself, but don't expect excellent results from Rosetta Stone alone."
Purchased this based on prior experience with other Kaspersky Products. Installs fast and conforms to how computer is set up. No problems with computer after installing this program either.
"IMO, the confusion is intended by Intuit.  Leaving the everyday and common Form D off of the Deluxe version allows a customer to possibly purchase the product and then when the customer discovers the absence of the form the customer is forced to upgrade to the Premium version or attempt to get a refund that takes weeks to receive.  I don't need to guess just what it is that I'm purchasing. I love Turbo Tax but I don't like the business practices of Intuit.  I've used Quicken and Turbo Tax for many years but I just purchased HR Block 14 Deluxe for one-half the price of Turbo Tax Premium.  I've bought my last upgrade for Quicken Deluxe also.  I can use my bank's online software and save myself even more time by not having to duplicate entries and doing downloads.  Intuit has lost my business.  Again, in my opinion."
"After reading the reviews I should have realized that this was a piece of junk, but I decided to try it anyway, what could go wrong it was free and was on the Amazon website free for Prime users. It was horrible, I mean REALLY HORRIBLE. I couldn't get it to work with my printer, it kept asking what printer I was using but when I tried to put the information into the space it did absolutely nothing. I finally went into my computer and deleted it BUT not before I had wasted A LOT of time trying to make it work. Maybe if you get the version that isn't free it's OK but this one? Don't waste your time like I unfortunately did."
NORTON ANTI-VIRUS OFFERS GOOD PROTECTION FROM VIRUSES AND SPYWARE; COUPLE IT WITH THE FREE WINDOWS 8 FIREWALL WHICH IS EASILY ACTIVATED AND YOU HAVE A COMBINATION NEARLY AS GOOD AS THE HIGHER PRICED NORTON NTERNET SECURITY PROGRAM. INSTALLATION IS FAIRLY EASY IF YOU WATCH TTHE SCREEN CAREFULLY FOR INSTRUCTIONS. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT NORTON BUGS YOU TO REGISTER your PRODUCT AND that PROCESS IS NOT SMOOTH NOR QUICK; I'VE HAD TOTRY IT SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE IT WAS ACCEPTED. THE PRODUCT WORKS WITHOUT REGISTRATION SO DON'TW ORRY ABOUT IT IF YOU GIVE UP TRYING..
"Serif DrawPlus X4 .... is WAY beyond my expectations for a product at this price point!

It has everything you need right out of the gate to import Web screen shots, scans, photo's and clip-art, THEN edit the mess into GREAT-LOOKING ad-copy!  The Artistic-effect Text offers great control over outlining and fill, tons of interesting fonts and easy angle and resizing control.

The INSTANT 3D for SHAPES is fantastic, you just pop in their pre-made shapes (hearts, stars, etc.) then right-click to select instant 3D and Voila!, there it is, fully controllable via rotation, size, position, color .... simply AWESOME.

I haven't even tried all the Photo Editing capabilities and Special Effects yet and I'm already Blown-Away by this product.

KUDOS TO SERIF !!!!!"
"I bought a copy of this product, knowing full well that it would give the user a taste of each language.  However, imagine my surprise when I listened to 3 of the languages and the CD was screwed up -- slurred phrases, jumps and skips.  I speak a bit of Welsh and when I listened to that language it was faulty as described.  I returned it for a refund."
"Works as expected, with the typical microsoft bugginess."
"Impressive depth coverage of the main lines. No coverage of side-lines 5 c4 or 5 Qe2. One chapter, I noticed (the chapter that covers 5 d3 and the main line with 8 Nc3 instead of 8 Re1 or 8 c4) has the wrong sound-clip attached, so you get a sound clip from the 3 d4 variation twice. Bottom line: one of the chapters doesn't have a sound clip. You can look at the variation in the Fritz player, but with no commentary. A bone-head error that basic quality control should have caught. The CD is still good despite this, however."
"No surprise  it can't be bought here - Rootsmagic is sold through its web site, and occasionally old or extra install disks appear on Amazon.

I would rate it as decent but seriously lacking.

It is relatively easy to use - if you can use it at all.  It works well on Windows.  It works well on Ubuntu if you either jump through a bunch of hoops not for the tech faint of heart using variously Wine or Playonlinux (which one works varies), or spend $49 on Crossover for Linux.  These deficiencies make it pretty much useless for a great many people.  People have complained about these deficiences for years, and Rootsmagic has absolutely NO interest in fixing the deficiencies.

Rootsmagic has an app for smartphones and tablets that is the next thing to perfectly useless.  On tablets and phones it lets you view but not create nor edit databases.  ???  I put the app on my large tablet, and went to spend an afternoon at my sister's house, all excited that I could do some genealogical work, and I couldn't do anything at all!  Since even serious genealogical researchers increasingly work on tablets, this seriously limits who can use this software.

Also, to sync between devices, one must use Dropbox; there is no other method.  I have used Dropbox; if you remove a file from any device it removes from Dropbox and may be lost across all of your devices, and it isn't like anyone can keep extra files on most smartphones and tablets.

The reason why it is hard to get it to work in Mac and Linux, and some people can't even get it to work correctly in Windows, is that the program relies on other Windows software for much of its functionality.  For starters it will not run if Internet Explorer and Flash are not installed.  ???!!!!!!  It needs external gif support (GDI support), even if not using gif images.  It needs external XML support (Microsoft XML parsers) - which is ludicrous.  Rootsmagic's database is structured around XML.  It won't run if you don't have certain Windows fonts installed.

There are people running Windows 10 who can't run Rootsmagic, most likely because no Internet Explorer.  It HAS to be Internet Explorer, even though any HTML pages actually open in Chrome or Firefox on your computer.

Then there are the low key nuisances. For example:

You can't open notes without opening the individual first.

When entering data, you have to first open a form with the name, birth, death and burial information, then REOPEN the form to enter any other information, including notes and sources.

You can get a fact to stay open and apply it to multiple family members if you put a period at the beginning of the first line, or something?  It was as clear as mud - and certainly not intuitive.

You have to jump through about three different hoops several times to get private data you upload online to actually be treated as private.  The living people in my family ended up on Ancestry after I marked them as private!

There are quite a number of little bugs like that.

The program has really deteriorated since I selected it a version or two ago, when you could enter what you wanted in the date fields and it would be on your reports as you entered it, and you could include multiple spouses and their children on ancestor reports.  Those were key reasons for choosing this software.

And, last but not least, on the Rootsmagic support list, when I mention that Rootsmagic is hoaky when replying to people, the moderator won't post it, because noone is allowed to say anything negative about Rootsmagic.  I don't think so!"
"I love that all my clients information, invoices and proposals can be pulled up without opening an excel file.  Invoicing and receiving payments is much simpler with QB.  Not only that, but all my tax information can readily be pulled up and sent to the accountant.  I can also have financial statements printed and on hand when applying for loans or credit.  My productivity level is much higher since I no longer have to spend so much time on invoicing and accounts receivable.  Now, my invoicing looks more professional and can be directly emailed to clients.  I would recommend QB to anyone who is running a business.  So easy to use!  Thank you QB!"
"I needed to upgrade an older version to run on Windows 7  but this version provides no significant improvements over older versions. It works fine but I just discovered (May 27, 2013)a printing issue with it. If I attempt to print more than one month at a time, it doesn't print anything and has wreaked havoc with my print spooler (turned it off), caused my printer drivers to get ""horsed up"" to the point a had to tell my PC that the printer was not there and reload my complete printer configuration including the wireless set up. After doing all this I verified that I could only print one month at a time. If I try to print several months at once, the print fails with dire results. Now even after all of this, it won't print at all. I guess I will have to try their famous technical support."
"I am very happy with the program, it is much faster, I upgraded from Windows xp, the bad part is there is no driver available to install for my HP wireless printer to work. Hoping one wil be avaiable soon"
"I bought this software to use the database excel, so far is been a greate experience.  One thing I like is one note which is very helpful as an organizer.  It my be use for anyone regardless of accademic background.  I am very satisfied with the productand I will rcomended."
great product....I would recommend it to anyone that wants a good free antivirus program!
"Course opens up fine, but after running it for a few minutes it seems to go into a DOES NOT RESPOND mode and have to kill this application; think it may be the age of the operating systems it was made for (2003 timeframe Windows 95/Me/XP); have same problem when I install it on my MacBook.  However, it does look like excellent learning material to work with, if I can solve this issue."
"I love this program, it took 4 hours to download for us.  Had to download twice."
"I do not recommend this program for the very beginnig student.  I used the ""transparent arabic"" program, which focuses more on literacy for a couple hours per day for about six weeks before supplementing it with the instant immersion program.  I could not follow even the first two lessons at that point.  The speaker does not explain clearly what he is saying, especially during conjugations.  It is very difficult to follow for the beginning student.  Also, the phrases are not repeated multiple times, which makes it hard to pick up nuances/slight variations between words.  Bottom line: get something else and consider this well down the line.  Library is a great source to try out multiple programs before wasting money."
VERY GOOD TKS.
"The company that originally created this software (Softkey) was bought several times and the current owners of the rights have no interest in upgrades to Win 7 64 bit.  I have managed to get it to run properly on my desktop with Win 7 64 bit OS, by setting it up with the compatibility wizard as a Win xp program, but cannot get it to run on my laptop.  No idea why as I have used identical settings on both.  This is by far the best labels program I have tried since 1997 when I  first bought it.  Why can't someone take on updating it?  There would be a market for it."
"My new Gateway laptop (manufactured in 2010) came with only a trial subscription to Microsoft Office so I needed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Office-2010-Home-Student-Disc-Version/dp/B00337D8U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Office 2010 Home & Student (Disc Version)</a>.  It installed seamlessly, quickly and with almost no effort on my part once I inserted the program cd.

I have been using Microsoft Word and Excel daily for approximately six weeks and have had no problems.  Neither program has frozen or crashed even once.  Both programs allow me to review and edit documents created with the earlier versions of Microsoft Office.  I have no IT training and am easily stumped by computer issues, so this has been a relief.

I find the newer editions of both Word and Excel similar enough to the previous versions to find the features I need (inserting a hyperlink, tracking changes, etc.) but even easier to use.  The word count is automatically tracked on the bottom left of the screen for any Word document - no need to go to the Review tab.  There is even a button in the Review tab to translate text into another language - no need to cut and paste into an online translation program.  For example, I translated the previous line into Spanish using Microsoft Word: Tambin hay un botn en la ficha Revisar para traducir texto en otro idioma - sin necesidad de cortar y pegar en un programa de traduccin en lnea.

Purchased for a new desktop with windows 8.  So complicated and unintuitive as to be unusable for the average person.  Case in point:  The user manual for the DVD burning section of the software package by itself is 153 pages long.
"This software works great as long as your house isn't designed much different than standard box houses and doesn't have complicated roof shapes.  I tried for two weeks to draw the correct roof on my house and have it draw in the right gable windows and finally gave up leaving a wide gaping side where a wall should be. It has an automerge capability for the roof for gables and hips that essentially made it impossible to draw my roof correctly because mine angles differently than they expect, apparently.  Developing slopes in the landscape area is equally frustrating and largely a lot of trial and error.  I finally got something close and gave up.  You really have to spend a lot of time doing trial and error for most things (for example, it took me forever to figure out how to put two stacked windows (a regular window and a top transom type window) on the upper level of a two story wall.  All in all, it did not work for what I wanted but I assume if I worked at it long enough and did enough forum support I might be able to get it to work but that is unknown.  I also tried to build a deck plan with it and while it did the basic deck well, I needed to draw a two level stairs that starts down and then changes direction at the landling and could not get it to do that either.  I eventually had to go to home depot and have them do it for me.  For basic work, it seems like a good program but for anything out of the ordinary, it didn't work for me."
"My Italian card would not play at all in Europe either. Not sure of the problem, perhaps Garmin products need optional antenna for added reception?"
"This product works great for those who are learning 3D graphic design and are beginners, there are several communities that are ready to help new artists. For the price of the product is one of the cheapest in the market."
"I got a trialware download of NAV and firewall 3 weeks ago. For a week, it worked fine, and I decided to buy the programs, so I picked up the CDs. Within a couple days, the firewall had frozen. It wouldn't work, couldn't be uninstalled, and eventually led to a cascade of problems that meant I had to have my whole OS reinstalled. I tried getting support through the Symantec website and found that this is apparently a very common problem with the program. I tried calling tech support. Not only do they charge you for help in fixing a problem their software caused, you can't get hold of them anyway. The line is always busy, and the hours are very limited.
I spent many hours trying to troubleshoot - to no avail. I actually have a real job and this is a computer I use to do my work. So my work suffered.
Once I got my system back, I decided to install just the NAV2002. I spent an entire day trying method after method to get it to install the antivirus. It would install programs that I didn't much care about - but not the antivirus. Again, I tried the website and the FAQs and the phone help. Same story - no help. I actually got connected via phone one time but then was immeiately disconnected at the last step through a very long phone menu.
I will never buy another Symantec product. It seems pretty apparent they are putting out a product with problems, they know it, and they are unwilling to stand behind their product by providing proper support. To me, this comes close to defrauding customers."
"I bought this on sale and it was a great buy.  It is a very good photo editing tool, but I do not use or understand 80% of the stuff on there.  But, the very basic software was just not enpough for me.  This was the same price, so I would reccomend this over basic software."
"I tried downloading AntiSpam trial version to see how I like it,
I noticed within days that when I download my email it has slowed the process down considerable. I use netscape and when I download my email daily (about 60-70) it seems to bog down. I hope they decide to remedy this challenge. I think I'll pass for now!"
I was told by Microsoft techs that this was a bootleg copy of the software.  Hundred dollars down the drain.
"MSFT products are horrible and constantly crash. After three decades of using their products you'd expect them to make their products more stable. However, all they do is change the icons around adding little value for the bulk of users. If there was an alternative without significant limitations I would have switched long ago."
"This CD ROM is really one of the best products about comics that I've ever seen. To the ones who missed the last issues of ASM is the perfect choice, and who wants to discover the origin of Peter Parker as our hero and his enemies is better than."
I am a former tax preparer who used other software geared to professionals.  This product takes too much control away from users and treats them as novices.  Perhaps that is its purpose.  I used it to prepare 2013 taxes and found navigating thru the various forms I needed a nuisance.  I would have liked the program to provide more flexibility to do what I want whenever.  Not everyone needs to be holding hands with the developers.  I changed some entries as I progressed thru to the forms only to find that the original entry was not changed until after I filed the forms electronically necessitating an amended return to be files later this year.  I doubt I will use it again next year.
This is the first time that I have actually felt this program surpassed the antiviral program I had been using. This is now my go to for any new PC I get and to those who would ask me what one I would recommended.
"Didn't Like the free Zip products out there,So I decided on the older 17 rather than the 18 a/c price. Works Great. I followed the advice of one of the reviews,which was after using the free version(of 18 until the evaluation ran out)I uninstalled ALL of it using revo uninstaller. Then I downloaded 17 from Amazon and had no trouble with the auth code. It installed easily"
"I found this very easy to use and used it to file the 1040 tax form.  I was disappointed when it came time to e-file my returns and although the federal was free I had to pay an extra $20 to e-file my state.  I thought the filing would have been included in the price of the software, not a way to get more money at the end."
"I enjoy the format and easy access of the cd-rom, as well as the other cds. I have just a little knowledge of the German language and have found this product to be invaluable."
"Been a long time Turbo Tax user, so I purchased again this year for 2014 filings.  I sold an investment property this year, but the guided prompts inside TT were so confusing, I ended up going to a CPA to make sure they were done correctly.  I think I am just done with TT altogether."
great product and support.
Despite their description that indicates that this product will work on a Mac - it does NOT! I was disappointed to waste $25 on this product. Caveat emptor - buyer beware.
"Please add option to turn on IF WANTED, a user selected folder on your PC to keep synced with your Cloud Drive. Similar to Dropbox. Otherwise this is useless, I can just use the built in browser upload."
"Norton's latest antivirus program does the job without bogging your system down with features.

The box is just a download code so that novices may be confused.  You go to the Norton website, create an account, and add the code.  Then you download your program.  It works on either Mac or PC

The install took less than a minute after the download to install, and I didn't need to reboot. This software is a basic antivirus without advanced firewall features.  I like this because full firewalls often get in the way.

This box is only one license, which is a steep price compared to competitors.  They offer free tech support, but I've always had bad experiences with their tech support. Language barriers are extreme with Norton.  The ""no-virus"" guarantee requires auto-renewal of the program.  The guarantee means you get a refund if you get a virus, not necessarily the virus removed."
Great product!
"This cd rom is not going to very helpful to someone who wants to become efficient in Gujarati. This disc does not contain very much vocabulary, and no grammar. I learned how to say 'milk' in Gujarati, but I wouldn't know how to form a sentence about milk. I would recommend this only for people who just want to impress someone with a few phrases or words, but it won't give you any understanding of how the language works. This cd-rom was because I work for a family who speaks Gujarati, and wanted to speak a little for them, but if you're looking to do more, it isn't for you."
the utilities portion of this software package will not work on 10.4 and Norton said it won't be updating it.  NOT WORTH THE MONEY.  Go with one of the many other programs that can actually do the work.  Norton has hit the skids!
Purchased as the OS for a new gaming rig that was built about 6 months ago. No issues. Took the Windows10 free upgrade option a couple months back.
"I worked in law offices for over 20 years and this is all we used.  WordPerfect is the best!  It's easy to understand and the help section is great, as well.  I was lost after I retired until I got this product.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EB06QUM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_77"
Was not as simple as previous years.  Had all sorts of problems with trying to e file and print out copies of returns.
It was used!
"I was very disappointed with this program.  Sentiments were uncreative. The art was pretty primitive. The advertising offered much more than you get:  pop-ups consisted of only one kind of simple pop-up; I expected more.  It touted store-quality cards, but Hallmark has no comptetition here. There are hundreds to thousands of sentiments for each catagory, but after going through a couple hundred of each I only found a handful I would use and those were unimaginative. The Easter catagory was all bunnies and eggs--no Easter symbols or greetings at all. If I could delete the parts I'd use, I would end up with about 25% of this program useful to me.  Also I had trouble opening files on disks 3 and 4.  The file icons appeared, but when you clicked on them most were empty.  And I couldn't open any of the font files.  I did like the special effects for text, the craft catagory, the stationary set, and photo editing. I would not recommend this program unless it is drastically improved. It's way too expensive for what you get."
"this product absolutely failed, even after updgrading to the Home & Business Premier, to handle any of my three LLCs. Checked all the online help, none of the suggestions works. If your LLC does anything but rentals this simply will not work worth a darn. Doesn't handle disregarded entities well at all. I spent days and days at it, and lots of time in the help section (the help is either out of date or in some cases flat wrong). It should have populated several state forms, but it just wouldn't, and the suggestions on how to work around it just didn't work. I ended up using paper to file a lot of my taxes because this program failed so completely. Of course, after struggling with this piece of junk for ages doing paper filings was very last minute, which I really dislike. I started early and my taxes are actually very very simple, but this program was not able to handle it."
"I have been using Quicken products for several years now and recently upgraded from Quicken 2013 Deluxe to Quicken 2015 Premium.  I am new to the Quicken investment management tools and so far have been pleased with the analysis tools.  However, i am very disappointed with the sync function from my accounts.  I have been frequently having issues downloading transactions.  Since upgrading, I have had incomplete downloads where one transaction does not download.  This means that every batch that I download, I cannot trust that Quicken has accurately reflected all of my transactions.  I need to find the missing transactions and manually enter them.  Although a minor inconvenience, I would not expect the software to get worse with a new release.  Quicken help says it's and issue with my bank and my bank cannot find an issue.  Not sure who is at fault, but since I paid quicken for the software, i hold them accountable to make the communication work.  Otherwise the software works well as an analysis program; but based on the flaky communication, i could not trust it for money management and certainly would not pay for the bill pay option.  Between this and the Turbotax security breach, my faith in Intuit products is not what it once was and it's time to look at other options."
"I've been a TurboTax user for years, so when I discovered that they're not charging an exorbitant amount of money to add a Schedule C, I'm understandably upset. As if tax-time wasn't a big enough pain, TurboTax has made it that much worse. I will never waste my money on this company ever again. This is such a disappointment. Shame on you, Intuit."
Works great
Thought I was purchasing a thumb drive not a dvd.
"This makes entering and editing phone numbers, etc. into my phone easier.  Uploading pictures works well.  Recommend."
"This will be the 11th year that I have used TurboTax to prepare my Federal tax return. Eleven years ago the user interface was a little difficult but workable. Last year the product was great and I expect it to continue to improve. Over the years, I have learned that the product is not infallible and some (but very few) mistakes were made, especially in the area of education credits and whether a ""Hope"" or ""Lifetime"" learning credit applies. I was able to successfully navigate through this problem but had to force it into the appropriate category. It remains important for the user to be aware of the tax laws so as not to be surprised by these problems.

I have always used the ""Basic"" version and have found that it meets all my needs including self-employment forms, capital gains, pensions, child care expenses, various tax credits such as the residential energy credit, and many, many more. I have never used the ""State"" product since state tax returns can be filed in New Mexico over the internet at no cost. You should check with your state to see if it has similar programs.

The only real problem with TurboTax is that the program is released early and before any federal forms are finalized. The update process is easy enough, but if you have a dial-up connection it will take a good bit of time. With a ""real"" high-speed connection such as cable, it's no sweat. This year it took me about a minute. I personally like to begin my return in December, so this is not a problem for me.

Another great feature is that you can copy personal information such as names, SSN, filing status, etc. from the previous year so you don't have to retype it this year. It also copies financial institution and W2 information which can be edited for the current year without retyping names, tax ID numbers, etc.

I highly recommend TurboTax and wouldn't use any other."
"Movavi's Screen Capture is simply great.  It can be used for still images or motion (i.e. a show, a movie, a video you made and want to copy, etc.[[ASIN:B00O8J0W6G Movavi Screen Capture 5 Personal Edition.  [Download Recording can be in a variety of formats.  What you record as a video can be edited afterwards with Movavi's editor and be finalized in the format of your choice.  When you do a screen capture you can specify exactly what portion of the screen is captured by framing a portion of the screen with boundary lines."
"Creating a video series about programming is not as easy as doing it for a visual tool like Photoshop or Dreamweaver, but this title does a really good job of teaching the fundamentals of PHP and MySql to a total beginner. Starting with the installation of a simple Apache MySQL and PHP stack like Mamp or XAMPP and then slowing showing simple examples about the absolute basics without getting to ""professoral"" and progressing to the main features of the language and it's use in the scenario of a simplified but still interesting Content Management System that you develop from scratch, this title will teach you enough to engage more challenging material and to start experimenting and building simple dynamic websites. Definitely another outstanding title from Lynda's library!"
I absolutely love this program I have been able to do so many things that I otherwise would have paid a lot of money to have a professional photographer to edit. I highly suggest getting this program and playing with it.
"McAfee 2016 downloaded and installed flawlessly. I have not used McAfee for several years, but they have greatly improved it since it's much better laid out than it used to be and it seems to run much more efficiently. So far, I'm extremely pleased with this product."
This is the best product you can buy.  If you have a small business trust me this is the only way to go to keep your accounting straight and make life easier for your tax person.  It is user friendly and doesnt take long to figure out the program.  This is an absolute must if you have a business.
"Norton has given up on being a software company - their only goal now is to take as much money as possible from comsumers, as soon as the public takes notice they will change their name or sell out.
  After 2000 or so they moved their cust svc and other functions to India and EVERYTHING went to hell in a hand basket.  People spend countless hours with software that totally sucks with support staff that has no idea and no experience.  Their only trick is to keep escalating issues around the room until they wear you out and you give up."
So far this is a review of just the install.  Win 7 machine with SSD.  It has now taken ovver 1.5 hours and the DVD is still spinning and copying files.  This is taking farrrr toooo long.
"The software worked great while it was installed.  However, I went to uninstall the software and my Windows 7 install would no longer startup.  Searching online it looks like this happens quite a bit based on quite a few posts in the avast forums.  I can't give a product that breaks your OS much of a good rating."
"It does the job for me. Any tax software would work. I just get the cheapest and it works. My stuff is pretty basic - Annual income, house, church donations, and that's about it."
Good protection and a lot cheaper on the Amazon website.
Horrible program. You cannot edit resume in word it only sends a PDF. If you create a resume for a friend they can't make any changes because it's a PDF. I think it's a good idea but it needs a lot of work. Don't waste your money find another software. If I could rate it negative STARS I WOULD THE PROGRAM SUCKS!
"I've been trying to get used to this software for 2 years since I left the PC and joined the Mac world.  I love the Mac, and won't go back.  But, Circus Ponies Notebook is really in need of someone who knows how to create a UI.  I find myself trying every feature, getting frustrated, and leaving it.  I don't come back for a few months.  There's an update.  And, it's still incomprehensible.  Some examples:

1) It decides whether to give you bullets, etc. based on the type of paper you create.  What moronic idiot thought of this?  I want to type some, then add a few bullet points.  Nope.  You turn on bullets.  The whole page gets bullets.

2) Try to use the flowcharting and you get boxes that won't resize.  At least not intuitively.  The arrow function seems to work well, but the boxes are frustrating.

3) Onenote's greatest feature, besides being the only PC software that was completely intuitive, was that it could take clips of anything, from anywhere, and embed them in the page.  It seemed nearly miraculous.  Circus Pony claims to be a onenote replacement.  Yea, like notepad is a replacement for Microsoft Word.  Circus does none of the things that Onenote did that are important.  Circus ponies is closer to postit than to onenote.

After 2 years, I decided to try and save some of you some money.  I don't have a onenote solution.  But it's not Ponies."
"I was experiencing repeated crashes, program errors, etc...and I thought it was me.  However, when I discovered the Studio 10 support forum (Google:  ""Pinnacle Studio 10 Support Forum""), I learned I was not alone.

The final straw today was trying to transfer some pre-Christmas video I recently took to my computer (worked fine) and add a soundtrack (crashed the program).  Figuring the 10.1 patch would solve my issues, I downloaded this behemoth.  2/3 of the way through applying the patch, like the software it was designed to fix, it hung.  After rebooting and applying the patch again, it ""took.""  When I attempted to re-do my editing chores, I discovered that all the voices and sounds associated with my video was now missing - plus the soundtrack I was trying to add when the system crashed wasn't there either.

After wasting > three hours on a project that left me with nothing to show for my efforts, I gave up.  What a horrible P.O.S.  (Piece Of Sofware).  It *almost* makes me wish I had bought a MAC - at least it works.

Review Summary:  Don't waste your money on this half-baked product.  Try ANYTHING else first."
"I have had an older version of dragon for years.  Decided to update to version 11.  This is the second disk that I have ordered, neither work.  The computer reads them as blank.  I tried contacting Nuance for some direction.  I went to their web cite - need to pay them to address issues.  So I sent an email.  They sent me an email of 6 various steps that I needed to take before even being able to post a question electronically much less actually speak to someone.

Needless to say, I returned the second disk and am searching for another similar product."
"Amazingly Fast. Buy Windows 8.1 if your looking for speed or if you hate something ""Metro Interface"" that is just a little touch on the modern side! Then Don't Buy It!"
"I've picked up the thread of researching my ancestry after a hiatus of some fifteen years.  My previous search included several trips to the Midwest and a number of visits to libraries and the South San Francisco branch of the National Archives.  While I accumulated a wealth of material, organizing it was an overwhelming task.  Thanks to Family Tree Maker, I've put all that material in a usable package and am looking forward to resuming my investigations."
"Easy to use, great features for a beginner, but my computer is older and couldn't handle this software very well."
Great book
"I returned this product and I am waiting for my refund. I wanted to switch from PC to Mac at work, but this version of Quickbooks did not work. It does not print a customer's total balance!!! It only prints the balance of that particular invoice. I called Intuit, and they said it was ""product limitation"". Thanks, but no thanks. I want my money back!"
"It was a free download and although you have to pay more to get the full product for full registry cleaning the little registry cleaning that it did do helped speed up the computer, so it was worth the time, effort and the price couldn't be any lower."
Despite reservations I decided I would try to upgrade my Vista machine to Windows 8; I was hoping to cut down on the ridiculous load times of Vista. I downloaded the software directly from the Microsoft site. Installation appeared to go well. After nearly 3 hours it looked like all was well. As I was setting up preferences I then got the message that the installation failed and my previous operating system was then (thankfully) restored. I could not find any easy solution from Microsoft. Some suggestions were complex to the point where you would need an engineering degree. At this point I would just like a refund but it is difficult to find how to obtain one.  I am very disappointed that a modern operating system would fail to install like this; and it seems they unrealistically expect an average person to perform computer engineer level trouble shooting in order to make the program work. One more thing; you are required to re-install your programs (even Microsoft programs). This could be a headache and it seems they could have come up with a way to avoid having to do that. Will likely migrate to Mac next system I get.  I'm just tired of poorly designed and poorly operational Microsoft products.
"I aquired this cheaply, thank goodness. It is pretty much useless. Present Progressive Tense, OVER and OVER, e.g. I am speaking.  And that's about it for verb conjugations. In Spanish, the present tense is usually used to express this. For example, in Spanish, while ""hablo"" means ""I speak"", it also means ""I am speaking""; it is much more likely to say ""hablo"" than ""Yo estoy hablando"" for ""I am speaking"".  There are big differences in the way these forms are used in English and Spanish. Yet, I would suppose it's much easier to write a program to teach one verb ending than, say, 6, for the present tense...of course, you'll have the ser and estar verbs down, just probably not the difference between the two.

To be fair, it does cover a lot of irregular verbs. But, if you're only learning one conjugation, what's the point? You won't even know they're irregular.

Over and over, and all throughout this program, this is all there is. No verb conjugations, no explainations of what your saying. I can't speak for other languages, but as for Spanish, look elsewhere, unless you want to speak in one verb tense that is used way less often than its English counterpart. FSI is best for fluency, Pimsleur is great for getting pronounciation and grammer basics down, and if used in conjunction with vocabulearn, is fairly effective, fairly painlessly."
I love that I can download for cheaper than I was purchasing this at Costco.  I don't have to drive over there anymore or have a CD-Rom and it's case cluttering a drawer each year.  This is second year I download and I recommend it.
"I've been using Turbo Tax for over 5 years. I used to do my own taxes and spend a week-end figuring them out (I have deductions, investments, etc). Now it takes me about an hour for Federal and State returns combined. I submitted my returns electronically, and received my refunds in 2 weeks.

This product is a lot cheaper than an accountant, and it gives you the same (or better) results. Very easy to use."
"I've already got a DVD and a book about the Colle-Zukertort by GM Aaron Summerscale (Foxy Openings ""20.d4 Dynamite"" DVD and ""A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire"") which are very good.

The DVD of Susan Polgar is nicer to look at (better Quality/Layout), but has much less contents. For instance, every Colle player knows about the many ""Anti-Colle"" plans, which are advertised by GM Roman Dzindzichashvili, IM Pete Tamburro etc.. These plans contain early deviations from the normal Colle continuation by using move orders like 1.d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3.e3 g6!? or 1.d4 d5 2. Nf3 e6 3.e3 Bf5 (or 3...Bg4), etc. Especially an early ...g6 - aiming for a King's Indian or Grunfeld position - is something which is regarded as ""a tough nut to crack"" (Aaron Summerscale, p. 78) for White.

Surprisingly, non of these Anti-Colle plans are even mentioned on Susan Polgar's DVD... Need I say more?

My advice: get the DVD and book from GM Aaron Summerscale if you wonna learn how to play the Colle-Zukertort (they both treat the Anti-Colle systems thoroughly)."
"I'm another former loyal TT user but NO more.  I am so glad I started looking into buying my 2014 software early and God bless Amazon for allowing reviews.  It has sent me to H & R Block for the first time after many years of faithful TT use.
I can't imagine who at TT thought this to be a good idea..........

I just hope Block takes this change as a positive and runs with it.
Looking forward to an easy tax prep with H & R Block.
Bye bye TT."
"This version of Yahtzee is incompatible with Windows Vista Premium.  Amazon's product description had no restrictions cited.  Most Yahtzee verions are not compatible, but I did find one from Spintiop that was."
"I wanted to open wps files, no luck. I deleted it."
"I switched to WebRoot after a disappointing experience with McAfee AntiSpyware. WebRoot does a far better job of scanning and detecting suspicious activity. It even steps in when I am downloading or updating software, which McAfee never did. WebRoot got PC Magazine's highest rating and for good reason. It is true it needs to be a part of a good firewall, virus package, but I have not had the XP problems others here have mentioned. Definitely worth the low price and your time to keep spyware out!"
"This software provides stratagies which help the student learn and a tracking componet which, by showing them their progress,  keeps them motivated.  If you are buying the ACT red book this product is a must have. Additionally, the company and its staff are dedicated to customer support and satisfaction."
Best PC protection and support that I have experienced.  Great product.  I highly recommend it use
"I've been using this for several weeks after bad experiences with ArcSoft Showbiz and Ulead VideoStudio.  I find the interface to be simple and straightforward. I was up and editing very quickly.  There are a few quirks but they are easy to live with.  It uses only a timeline interface; I think adding a story-board mode would improve it, but I'm doing fine without it.
This editor has a rich feature set.  For instance, you can apply video filters to individual clips, groups of clips, or you can just put it on the entire output.  (Great for me, I can create one filter that compensates for the low saturation of my camera.)  You can also create your own templates for filters, text, etc.  It has a very intuitive way of changing the gamma on fades, too.  SMS also has better audio capabilities than the other tools I've tried.  And you can specify your own external audio editors, film capture tools, etc.
On large projects it can be slow to load, but it's pretty fast once it's going.  (Ulead VideoStudio is maddeningly slow all the time.)
This tool uses MyDVD as the DVD authoring tool.  It has some limitations but I've worked out a few tricks that keep me happy.
You can only capture as AVI, and when you ""create a DVD"" it generates AVI.  So I use the honestech tool to batch-convert to mpegs (which causes some problems)and I generate mpg files and THEN go to MyDVD.  Minor irritations.
Overall I recommend this highly.  I downgraded it on Ease of Use because they have a moronic online registration that rarely works.  You have to register both the product and the mpeg plug-in, so be ready to call Customer Service twice.
Documentation and tutorials are excellent.  Well-integrated and thorough."
I could not stay interested in making my data base. What I need to do is take the full course then go back and try to finish my data base. I have trouble staying interested and watching all of it.

"I considered getting a kindle till I tried the app, have it on my desk top, ipad and phone, it's great!  Don't understand the extra charge for whispersync to listen to books.  Unless I'm misunderstanding, there is an additional charge if you want to listen with the kindle app.  That's a downer, must be a way to get more people to try Audiobook which turns out to be cheaper per book, but would rather not have 2 apps for books. I called customer service to clarify this but could not understand the woman who was trying to explain (English is not their first language and they both had heavy accents) and she did not seem to understand my question so I gave up.

Anybody want to clarify????  If you want to listen to books with kindle you pay for the book then an additional charge for whisper sync to listen to a book?"
very good item thanks.
It does the job - just as in any other tax wizard software.
My association with WordPerfect started back with the first DOS version.  A Windows version came loaded on Several Dell comupters that I bought in the past.  I still used an earlier version 10 or 11 because I knew where things were.  I understood the use of tables and 'Reveal Codes' and MS Word was not worth my learning for personal use.  I use the X7 version on my Windows 10 and it works very well.  For me it is totally home and personal use.
"Where do I start? Formatting changes randomly while I am working forcing me to go over documents again and again to make sure they comply with requirements. Apparently, programmers cannot spell. I cannot believe the number of words that have to be ""added"" to the spell check. It freezes for no reason. Currently, I need to do an extremely simple document in a modified outline form with sections beginning A., B. C., D. That's too much to ask of Microsoft word. It keeps spontaneously changing my ""C."" to ""B."" though that is already listed and ""D."" though there is not yet a ""C."" Were it allowed, I could hand print faster than it takes to wrangle a document out of this program. I could go on, but I have to return to my torture otherwise known as my document. Thanks for eating up my time before a deadline Micro-assholes!"

"Still a fan of H&R Block tax software. Have been using it for years. Really like the Deduction Pro feature. Easy to use, when used correctly you get accurate results. Hasn't let me down yet. Just bought the 2016 package of Deluxe + State."
I love the free Avast antivirus.  It is user friendly and seems to work very well.  I have not had any problems since I started using this which was about 6 months ago.  It lets you schedule your scans when you want to.  It updates all the time so the chances of some virus getting into your computer is slim.  It is totally free and an unbelievable value!
"The product is just excellent. It does exactly what the Adobe PRO does, if not better. And the price is fair. The support team is amazing. I emailed them and got a response on the same day. I solved my problem.  The program developer and the support team deserves one extra star. I am extremely satisfied. 100% product."
This disk suks. Waste of money. Does not work
"Worst genealogy software I have used. I started FTM many years ago with version 1.0 and upgraded through version 10 of the original developers. Excellent products then. And made several big, thick books which were happily printed and shared with the rest of the extensive family. So, I updated, I thought, to FTM 2011 deluxe by Ancestry. What a bad experience !!!! All previous versions would update perfectly, without changes or hiccups, the works previously done over the years. But not FTM 2011 !!!! And it did not warn of this inability either in the instructions or in the publicity !! Just a message after importing the previous data that ""some data did not import correctly"" !!!!!! It messed up the formatting on books to make them childish and unusable. Such as not wrapping text around inserts or pictures like the original software which made the books look very professional.

Perhaps newbees and newcomers without any experience in genealogy may accept the crude limitations of the current software. Which is fine. But I am not about to redo all my previous, long and laborious, but delightful work and downgrade it to meet this new edition.

Fortunately for me, Microsoft fixed a Windows 7 driver in a recent update such that my original FTM 10 now works perfectly in said OS, including exporting to pdf. Therefore, I am stopping all attempts to nurse FTM 2011. I can use its space for something better."
Horrible Customer Service. Will never buy again.
same as new and works good had no trouble installing  good seller.
Did what I needed done.
Webroot does awesome job and not intrusive
"I like Quicken products and this is no exception. In my case it has a lot of features that I didn't need. This version provides a free ebook of Nolo's Encyclopedia of Everyday Law and an one year subscription to its Online Living Trust which I was glad it did. I also signed up to be a complete organ donor, the brain has to be donated separately, and I hope using my body to practice on helps to save the life of some creature. Another plus was the paperback book, The Legal Answer Book for Families, which I skimmed through since none of that information was needed at this time. They also offer another version of this product with a more comprehensive paperback that you may want to compare before purchasing. Keep in mind you can upgrade with this from previous versions of Quicken WillMaker, WillMaker Deluxe, and Quicken Lawyer Personal, from 2002 to 2014, as each is only valid for the year it was produced and each year has pertinent legal updates. Also these estate planning documents are not valid in Louisiana, U.S. Territories or Canada. For the amount of information you get for this price, it's a great deal. The only reason I deducted one star is I think the other book version is easier for those somewhat lacking in computer skills. Just take your time and you'll be glad like me that you chose one of their WillMaker products."
The unit was well packageed and delivered what was promised.  Easy software installation; I would recommend the product to anyone.

"I got this for my 8yr old son, he loves it. he said its a little bit hard but would play all day if i let him. There are printables that he likes. I have Vista so i had to install with compatibility wizard."
"I recently got an Acer Netbook and had to decide which anti-virus program to install on it. I was going to use Norton 360, since I've had good luck with it, but then I discovered that Kaspersky makes the only security program that's just for ultra portables, like my Acer. After checking around, I decided to buy it on Amazon.com, since nobody else came close to the price I paid. It was just the right purchase to make. Kaspersky works great on my netbook. I'd highly recommend that other netbook owners consider Kasperky Security for Ultra Potables and buy it here."

"I'm very vigilant when it comes to surfing unknown websites and I usually rely on IE 7's Malicous Site  security feature,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Webroot-s-Spyware-Sweeper/dp/B0016PV4NA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Webroot's Spyware Sweeper</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-s-Internet-Security/dp/B001E0RZ3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton's Internet Security</a>&nbsp;which hasn't let me down... yet! But I know that sometimes they are not enough.

If you use any&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Traffic-Exchange/dp/1430315768/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Traffic Exchange</a>, both manual and auto surf programs, this is a great addition to your security arsenal. However, you will need to babysit your computer, because this program will go off like a high school fire alarm and nail just about every other website on those traffic exchanges. Some webmasters are just scandalous!

With all of that said, I do like this program. It is easy to upload and didn't have any conflicts with any of my other programs, epecially with the use of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/XP-Pro-with-SP3/dp/B0018RCAD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">XP Pro with SP3</a>.

Overall, very satisfied with the program and it's compatability."
"I really like this software. I think it's a good option for people who like photoshop but can't afford the price tag. There's a lot going on here. You can edit your photos, in so many different ways. There's the standard things of course, rotation, one click fix, etc, but it really does have some super cool adjustments and effects and they're pretty user friendly. Some that aren't available with photoshop, that I could have used a bunch of times over, like smart carver, which lets you cut objects out of your picture then scales it back to size.

It's pretty user friendly if you're already familiar with photoshop, if not, it may take some getting used to. You can work with layers and masks, just like in photoshop. The program has a lot of the same tools, different types of brushes to choose from, which I haven't delved much into yet as I've mostly used it for photo enhancement. It has the shapes to (with a limited number of shapes and I haven't looked into if there are more available, but probably).

There is a learning center that pops up when you start to use a new tool, so if you are unfamiliar with the program, instruction is right there for you. There's also a section for instant adjustments and management of photos.

One of the best things is the photo retouching tools. You can do a lot with portraits with this program. Your selfies will never be the same.

I think if you're looking for a program like this, this is a great one, especially if you're already familiar with Photoshop. If you're thinking about getting Photoshop, but it's out of your price range, this is something you should consider. Also, if you're a rookie with stuff like this, I'd have to say this program is more user friendly than Photoshop. Is it as good? That remains to be seen as I've just started using, but I'm definitely going to split my time between the two and see which I prefer."
Program kept crashing

"Did the job, no problem with that at all."
"We were in the first group that sent informatin to FTM when they began many moons ago. FTM 2012 is fine for us, but can be to far advanced for a beginner. The new method of the way pictures are added is a big help. If you are just beginning, go slow and make sure your information is correct. We have spent 25 years correcting information handed down as, ""My great aunt told my aunt who told my mother who told me that she heard her friend tell a friend that a friend told another friend that General Washingtown sleep in this very bed"". That bed was built 35 years ago.

 We had a cousin who wrote that one of our forfathers was one of General Washington""s Honor Guard and it appears on a stone in the cemetery. This stone also reads that that forfather died in 1812, but his will reads 1825. This is hard to clear up. Make sure of your facts."
"If you don't want to pay full price, you can always buy a year old copy and use the install code to get the latest version."

I wanted all of these Slingo games though i've only played a few so far. I had a download but was always haing trouble with it so I deleted it and loaded the CD-Rom version instead. The seller was quick and I didn't have to wait long.

"I was skeptical of this program at first, but had a chance to demo it for several days at a conference. It's compelling and fun to use. It's also accurate-- at one point I was focusing on relaxing and allowing some balloons to float slowly across the bottom of the screen. Someone came up behind me and startled me and the balloons jumped up to the top of the screen in time with my reaction. My only complaint is that parts of it are a little slow and talky. It's well worth the expense if you're interested in developing your mind/body communication, although probably not as valuable for someone who is already well into that."
"For the second year in a row, our ""friends"" at H&R Block, have offered their complete software in 1 box for 1 reasonable price.  The catch as always as if you lived in 2 states, you have to get to 2 state programs via download (and the second will cost extra).  2 kickers to be aware of this year however. 1) It appears this time you can't get your first state (the one that comes as bought) until you are ready to process your state return. 2) The CD with the free e-file is now sold as a separate identity, if you wanna e-file using this version, you have to pay for it during installation. By the way speaking of paying on installation, H&R Block is mailing copies out to people who registered the software in past years (they did this last year as well).  These mailed out copies are NOT free.  You have to pay for them on installation.  Fortunately, they email you a ""receipt"" with an ""activation code"" so if you have to uninstall and reinstall the disc, you don't have to pay again, just insert the cd and enter the code.  Still and all, I have been using this since it has come our I think in 2000, and it is as always user friendly and a lot less expensive than Turbotax.  Definietly, a big help to doing taxes at home."
good
The software was user friendly and I would recommend it for Home and Business tax filing for those who prepare your own taxes.
Great product! Thank you.
"I have run OS X in all its incarnations, on both PowerPC machines, and for 20 months on a Core Duo MacBook.  Tiger was a dream.  It never caused me a concern, was quick and reliable.

Leopard takes up an additional 4 gigabytes of space on my HD than did Tiger.  It loads more slowly, much more slowly.  Sometimes I think I'm running Windows again.

And speaking of Windows, my version of Parallels does not work well with Leopard, forcing me to make a decision to upgrade to 3.0, or go to Fusion (my likely choice).

Adobe still hasn't issued a version of PhotoShop Elements that will run natively on the Intel chip, and whereas PhotoShop Elements 2 ran well on Tiger under Rosetta, it will not run at all on Leopard--and I really miss it.

SuperDuper!, which I have used for back-up, and would prefer to continue using since you cannot boot from a TimeMachine back up, still hasn't issued a Leopard-compatible version.  I'm sure it will come, but I miss it.  It was quick and ultra-reliable.

I had to download a couple of drivers for printers I use.

The iPod-iPhone mods to Finder leave me cold, and stacks don't mean much to me, either.

I can still go back and restore Tiger with a SuperDuper! back up, and I think about doing that every day."
I don't use the cloud player. I would like to not even have it. Could someone help me get rid of it?
"Glitchy as hell. During playback, a random sound will play between measures, and you can't get rid of it, and yes, it is still there after export. The panels for instruments keeps drifting off the bottom of my screen, forcing my taskbar to stay open, blocking all the controls in Magix. Copy and Paste seem to work when they feel like it. Certain instruments won't play, and nothing in the MIDI editor even tells you what octaves are active with the instrument. The add-ons instruments will work when you use them in one session, just don't expect them too when you reopen you project. About a month after I got this software, they sent me an email for the next version, but after the total mess of the 2014 version, who would even try the 2015 version. Oh yeah, don't mind the total random crashes, that occur when you run the program, try to close the program, when your trying to select an instrument, when your trying to open a media file. ETC. I gave it 2 stars, because when all the stuff above didn't happen, on that rare occasion, I was actually able to create some stuff."
"I recently received a copy of Data Backup 3 with my new Guardian Maximus Raid, and initially I was having a problem scheduling backups with the software. I emailed tech support and received a link to a newer version of the software from Michael,  who was extremely helpful. The new version works well, and it's a good feeling to know that your backups are up to date! I really like the folder synchronization features too, that's missing in a lot of similar software."
This was an updated version of Rand McNally Tripmaker 1998 which I used extensively.  The software still works very well and I am pleased with its results.
"My wife and I are both learning Portuguese with Fluenz. We are both in level one; I have finished session 7 and she has finished session 10. We are starting to speak Portuguese to each other and can usually understand what the other is trying to say! (But not always)

The program and style of teaching works well for us as long as we work on it each day. If we just can't understand and apply a concept, we just repeat the class and workouts. If we have to be away from it for a while, as during the Christmas holidays, and find we can't quite remember correctly, it is so easy to go back and ""sit through the class"", practice with the workouts, and we are back up to speed again. The program also has flashcards for each lesson that allow you to practice pronunciation and/or spelling as fast or slow as you want.

Our support questions before and after purchase were quickly and accurately answered. Thanks, Andy!

Fluenz is working so well for us!"
"I have used Quick for over 10 years and really like the software. I don't like the newer budgeting system that comes in this version of the Quicken software as it seems limited in customizing for your own budget. The mobile app is nice and is great for adding transactions while away from home, but doesn't seem to work well after syncing with the desktop side. Another issue is that the mobile app doesn't sync with the bills reminders. This in turn makes it hard to keep the bills straight if you pay a bill online while away from home. It leaves the bill reminder on the desktop computer."
"No problem at all with installation. It installs smoothly without having to remove previous versions. For some reason although I purchased the software they recommended downloading it from their website which I did. I like to have the hard-copy in case of emergency but this install went well. Only put it on one computer so far, but all is just fine, installed a couple of weeks ago already.
Have have purchased Norton several times already and have been happy."
"Last year, I purchased and used Turbo Tax Premier for the first time, and it was unbelievably smooth.  Not so this year - and be aware that you must purchase the new edition for each tax year: there are no updates from the manufacturer. In the previous year, I did both my and my daughter's returns with no problem.  With the 2005 edition, after doing an initial run-through of my returns I was unable to transfer last year's info and start a new 2nd set - the default info would NOT change from the first set without deleting each item line-by-line.  I took my paperwork to a tax accountant, and he found an additional $800 federal refund due to me, and that my state payment was $400 less than what TurboTax calculated it to be. A waste of $60 - do yourself a favor: go to H&R Block."
"Purchased this product on preparation for a new job. Worked well and haven't had any issues since install about 2 months ago.

We have it on a partitioned drive and haven't had issues with either OS on that drive."
"I contact Smith Micro to ask if the upade is coming. They answer that is, since few months...
I try in compatibility but it don't works too.
Loose my money."
"We've been using NTI Backup for quite some time. It seems quite reliable and user friendly. However, the one thing most managers seem to like about it is that it's automated... ie. you don't have to worry about when you last backed-up. Once you set it up you just change your disk daily. The only one thing I would say they could improve on a bit is a little faster support. I notice they put a lot cuter rep on the front cover too!"
"I have managed to do some really nice arrangements and tracks with GBJP classical orchestra, but I wish Apple had included more instruments e.g. BASS CLARINET (essential for 'dark' atmospheres and a gorgeous sound), FFF FRENCH HORN - no I'm not stammering. I mean a triple forte French Horn. Again, an unmistakable sound for drama. MUTED TRUMPETS - a no brainer. MUTED STRINGS - you can 'fool' the program by taking off a lot of treble but it still doesn't imitate that romantic 'soft' glow of warm muted strings. AND many many more.
I would have like a LOT more articulations too. Most instruments are capable of subtle but noticeable variations on their playing techniques that ALL modern orchestral pieces exploit. If anything, the percussion comes off best here as different velocities produce marked changes. Well? Why not in the pitched instruments too? The differences are not all that marked, especially with reed instruments.
I would gladly pay another $50 (at least) to have a much wider spectrum of sounds here. It's NOT disappointing - more frustrating as the samples provided are pretty good and just wet your appetite for more. It is NOT a totally fulfilling package, regrettably. More please - MUCH more!!!"
This really helps an average guy like me do my taxes accurately.
"The item came quickly and was in the condition that was stated, my husband enjoys playing this game each day. Will buy more things in the future from this site."
"I was running out of room on my system drive (C:) after installing XP, especially after turning on the system recovery process that eats up alot of HD space. I had plenty of room on my other two partitions, so I purchased Partition Magic. It installed easy, and was very easy to use. Do back up before you rearrange or change your system. Every machine is different. I have used it twice to reallocate my free space between partitions with no problems at all."
Did not work with Win10. Refused to recognize itself! Returned for credit!
"Bento has an attractive interface and it is very easy to use.  It integrates well with Calendar, Contacts, and many other programs (Excel etc).  For quickly doing very simple and casual database functions its great even if you've never used databases before.

Unfortunately its extremely slow as database sizes grow (its great for hundreds or even thousands of records but starting in the tens of thousands of records it gets unbearably slow).  Its also fairly buggy, frequently hanging, crashing and loosing data.  To me that makes it unsuitable for any serious work.

Hopefully Bento 3 will resolve the performance and reliability issues with Bento 2."
Just your basic video editing and uploading software. Lacks many of the more advanced features like layering. But ok for the beginner just learning.
I've used Turbo Tax for many years; good results.
"Great service!  Product was received in good condition, sans the original box but had the code on the CD itself.  Works well!  Definitely worth the money I spent, and thankfully at a reduced price!  Thanks!"
"My bank is one of the largest in my region, and this thing still cannot synchronize with a simple checking account.  I'm glad I tried it out on my friend's computer before I purchased it.  MS Money 2004 Premium isn't any better, but at least it's less money."
"Kindle is so functional that I can't imagine anyone has not heard of it and used it!
Me? I really like it!"
"I have a laptop running Vista that came with a free trial version of this program. I never activated the free trial, which may or may not have something to do with why this version failed to install properly - I'm not sure. What I do know is that in each time I tried (about 6 times in total, over a week) it seemed to go through the entier installation routine as one would expect, until it got to the end and then it would ask if I wanted to activate the free trial version - it never got to the point of activating the full version I was trying to install. I tried calling Norton customer service, but always got snared in a horrible cue. Since this is not my primary computer I simply gave up - there's a point at which the time investment is simply not worth it, especially since I already have other anti-virus programs that do work. (and yes, I disabled the other one before trying to install this) I have used Norton products in the past, and they've always worked reasonably well, but this was an exercise in pure frustration."
"I've used H&R Block now for several years.  Really like it.  Price is better here on Amazon than from H&R direct AND Amazon keeps a backup of previous years programs, which can really come in handy - like when I had to do a correction from a previous year."
Ask my great grandson who is using it daily. With his broken wrist it allow him to do his school work.
"The program simply won't install from the CD.

And the company hasn't responded to my email about  the problem. I know others have reported the same problem. So, not good since  I spent $48 with tax and now  I got  to fish out my receipt and figure out how to return it."
"My clients run Windows, and I must have a native Windows OS with Office apps to ensure that my documents, presentations, spreadsheets are in the EXACT same format when they arrive as when I see them on my screen (Office for Mac is slightly different, and it's hard to tell how those differences will show up on the other end).  I've used Parallels for more than 4 years and it is the reason I'm able to use my Mac (which I love!) and run my business."
"The activation code expires after one year (12 months). Also, you can only register this product once. If you have to reinstall windows, or upgrade windows, before the expiration date you can't re-use the code to activate the product; you have to purchase another activation code. This means that an undergraduate student will spend at least $79.96 to $99.95 over the course of 4-5 years on a study aid. Just another way to bleed students dry."
"my daughter is 3, and loves this game. its easy enough and very scientsy. She isn't much of a sesame fan more a bubble guppies (which i also got the game) but this one is by far better that the bubble guppies one. there more to do, the BG is very repetitive."
TurboTax is the easiest way I know to do taxes.  The deluxe version handles simple rental property calculations easily and accurately. I began using it 4 years ago; it's well worth the price. The benefit of using it for successive years is that it looks at the previous returns and offers suggestions for averaging taxes.
"After using PC/Microsoft forever, switched to iMac.  Was having incredibly difficulties adapting to Apple's ""office"" suite but didn't want to pay for Microsoft Office.  Found Apache OpenOffice and it works great!"
"Buying a 3-user pack is not what it seems. The license starts for all 3 copies with the installation of the first machine. If you don't install all 3 copies immediately, you will have less than 1-year on the other copies.  I feel that I have been cheated and will never buy Symantec products again."
"I relied on this software to accurate calculate my taxes.  Unfortunately, it didn't include the right information about the HIM, and I just received a letter from the IRS that my taxes were filled out wrong.  It will be at least another month before I get this straightened out.  I called H&R Bloc customer support, but only got hung up on.  The don't seem to think they should be responsible for these issues.  I disagree - this is classic detrimental reliance.  Do not rely on this software, you sill get screwed."
WORKED FINE FOR ME
"I've been using PCMover for about 3 years. I have moved about 20 systems during that time.  It works better than any other way of upgrading from systems such as WinXP to Win10.  It moves data, programs, settings and lets you know which programs may have problems in the newer system.  It also alerts you to utilities that will not work in the newer system, so you can make arrangements to find a substitute.  In short, it not only does a great job of moving the systems, but saves you a bunch of headaches as well.  I and many of my clients are delighted with PCM."
"If there is a native Mac application, go for it. If you have a Windows application that you cannot give up Parallels is the perfect companion. There is no need to reboot.  Just open Parallels (I have installed Windows-7). It works as well, or better than Windows on PC). I usually leave it in the background so that I can open it immediately but it actually boots extremely fast anyway. Highly recommended."
"For anyone who wants their 64bit wide screen desktop PC to act like your portable tablet, you'll love it.  For everyone else, this is a disaster!  I wish there were negative stars for this one.  I've been with Microsoft since the early DOS days when we configured IRQ's by hand and this is just a mess (including Win 8.1 and 8.0).

First, you'll need to go the internet and find yourself a startbutton application, then seek the internet for everything else, like starting-up in desktop mode, adding the control panel back, disabling stuff to protect you from installing your own programs (!), etc.  With about a day's effort, you can succeed in getting it to look like Windows 7 and be a normal functioning desktop (or laptop) PC.  Then it will feel like a PC instead of MS trying to get you to go to the Store and buy Angry Birds for your desktop.

If you're used to Windows Media Player and Winamp, you'll be surprised when the music ""App"" launches and you get this giant solid blue screen with a mini drag bar on the bottom left.  Don't worry, if you've lived through previous versions of Windows, you can figure out how to associate mp3's with a real PC program.

Don't make this mistake - I had switched to Windows 8.1 Preview because I thought it offered some relief over Windows 8.0.  Well, on 1/16, my PC started rebooting itself.  It said it would reboot every 2 hours because the preview edition was now turned off (I didn't know it would turn off!).  So I try to upgrade to 8.1 but I can't because you can only do that with the Store App (or an iso file, which didn't work because my key code was no longer valid for the 8.1P).  The Store wouldn't connect because my version of windows was no longer supported.  So I backed all the way back to 8.0 again.  What I didn't realize with the ""refresh"" is that *all* of my programs would be deleted - yes, including all my hand additions to my music recording software - gone!!!  But my documents stayed behind.  Then, I upgraded to Windows 8.1 through the Store.  At this time, I switched my account to reference my Microsoft account (something I should have done the first time).  Now when it completed - my *Documents* folder was deleted (because my user name changed to the MS account name).  No way to get them back - not even in the ""Old"" directory.  I should have backed up *everything* to the network drive before touching a thing on here.  I downloaded some programs that search the drive to recover files and that actually got back about 70% of my missing files.

So beware of any maintenance like changing versions and always backup everything.  If you can, I recommend waiting until Windows starts releasing operating systems that look like they're made for PC's instead of shoe-horning a tablet OS into a desktop.  Or seriously consider switching to a Linux OS (I use both).  If you have no other choice but to get a WIndows 8 PC, do some research on the web first for the settings changes that most people do and have that handy when you first start it up to make the experience better.  Note that the right mouse key will do mostly nothing and you'll need to keep hitting the ""Windows"" button to get around, which will feel very different, until you get it back to desktop mode."
Seller and Amazon are great. Delivery was fast. Federal part of the program does what is expected. Rating is because of how much additional states cost. They are 39.95 and that is more than I paid for the whole program and one state.
"HAVING BEEN A TURBO TAX USER FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE TO SAY THIS MAY BE THE MOST TAXING RELEASE YET.  ALTHOUGH EACH YEAR THEY SEEM TO IMPROVE MANY ASPECTS OF THE SOFTWARE THIS YEAR IT SEEMS TO USE MANY MORE KEYSTROKES THAN NECESSARY.  TOO MUCH RETURNING TO THE TOPIC FOLDER TO ADVANCE TO THE NEXT OPTION.

"I purchased 3 Mastercook 11 CD's because of my excellent experience with other cookbook CD's. One for myself and 2 as gifts.  It sounded like the perfect solution to any cook's desires.  It came with no instruction, and no tutorial.  It appears to have many features that you are on your own to figure out.  The company ( Valusoft)that produces it only lists a fax number and a snail mail address.  I did find their telephone # on the net 952-442-7000.  I called the number only to receive a recording instructing me to leave information and they would call back within 24-48 hours.  It has been over one week. I have called three times and never received a return call.

I will continue to try to figure out the operation of this CD for a couple more days before they all go back.  I only wished it could have been what it was advertised to be."
"As a contract management specialist, I have to maintain a current and up to the minute list of more than 1000 contract actions that pan over a life cycle of up to 5 years.  For each contract action, there are 40+ attributes that I need to keep track.  Moreover, working with several interrelated offices within the organization, I also have to generate different reports on these contract actions for my internal and external customers.  It would continue to be a daunting task if I keep track of these contract actions on a workbook.  Through my knowledge of Integrating Microsoft Office applications, I determined that Access 2010 would be the best application for me to keep track of data on these items.  So over the past month, I have spent time developing a contract management database.  To ensure that I spend the minimal amount of time designing and developing this database, I have decided a take a quick course to brush my skills on Microsoft Access 2010.  As a satisfied learner of another IT Training course (Microsoft Excel 2010), I contacted Dream Force LLC and inquired about availability of training materials on Access 2010 and Database Management.  I was pleased to find out that this IT Training provider offers Access 2010 course on DVD for only $39.99, the same price for Excel 2010 training that I obtained a little less than a year ago and more affordable than competing training products.  And once again, Dream Force LLC has trained me to become an advanced user of Access 2010 in no time.  With 140+ topics covering basic skills as `creating tables', shining the `dance floor', `one-to-one relationship', `one-to-many relationship', `enforcing referential integrity', `forms', `queries', and `reports' to challenging tasks such as `creating macro' (running a set of tasks) and restructuring the database.  From soup to nuts, I was able to move current data from an ""old school"" workbook to an advanced database I have just developed, showcasing a Front-End Switchboard Terminal, ready for users to enter data, retrieve information, print reports and update existing records.  This training program comes complete with 3 levels (Basics, Intermediate and Advanced), complemented with Exercise Files, Instructor Notes, Review Questions and Answers.  This way, you can be assured that you will get all the tools you need to learn and excel in every topic.

What you need to know about database management and Access 2010, this course will take you there. The video lessons show the LIVE (production) Access environment. The instruction is very easy to follow along and the instructor will let you know what you may expect to see on your OWN COMPUTER screen so that you will never miss a thing!

I love this course, and the DVD will be a good reference material whenever I need it.  It will be my best companion as I prepare for my Microsoft Office Specialist Certification exam!"
"We've been using Quicken since it was a DOS program and can't imagine trying to manage our personal and Micro-business finances without it. At year-end, it takes about 10 minutes to run the reports our CPA needs to efficiently prepare our taxes.  I highly recommend Quicken and QuickBooks On-line whenever I'm talking to someone and they mention managing finances! We recently updated to 2015 and it was seamless! Thank you for a great product!"
"We received this product quickly, I think within three days of ordering.  It installed well.  Initially it allowed us to take the pre-test, then it froze as others mentioned.  However, we called, talked with teh support and it was corrected and the kids love it!
Thanks!"
Works as expected. was able to do my taxes in less than 30 mins and able to feel confident that nothing was missed.
Do not purchase this. I purchased it because it is supposed to be so much better than microsoft word but it is not. I cant even re-coop my money back. Product is horrible
"I bought this product because I had downloaded a demo version from their site that worked pretty well. I had to reformat and reinstall my programs, and when I tried the product again, it slowed the internet connection to the point of it being useless. I have since removed the software, and I am a bit reluctant to install it again on the system, even though I have the licensed version, afraid that it will mess things up to the point of having to reformat and reinstall, which would be a small catastrophe in my case. The first time worked like a charm, the second time it was awful. I don't know what to do with it now. I am waiting for a ""computer wiz"" friend to help me decide if it is a good idea to install it or not."
"Mac user first, quicken lover since first version. In short, I was happy for a long time. With the arrival and now usage for last 3 months, I'm ecstatic. Bravo  intuit!"
DO NOT BUY!  I have Windows 8 and the thing will not download.  Microsoft Office link - not helpful.  GET  A DISC!
"There really is not much to review about this item.
The iterm I needed was an update for my Garmin GPS. First, it took over two weeks for a CD to get to me. When it arrived, seller had sent me a single use item only. It had had been used once already, therefore I could not use it again on a different equipment. Seller claims he did not know that was the case. I am still waiting for my refund."
"I hate this product,  it is hard to load, and Norton wants to charge  for there help.  I need my money back"
We can get pictures printed again.  That was our goal.
"My two-year-old is already adept with a mouse and enjoys games like ""Blue's Birthday"" and ""Sesame Street Letters.""  The slow pace of this game, long narrations, and the fact that he only has to scroll-over pictures and not click on them are very frustrating to him.  He really wants to play with Pooh, but it just makes him angry.
I was especially disapointed with the foreign language section.  Instead of using a total-immersion method such as introducing a new friend who speaks to children only in the foreign language, Rabbit operates a translator machine.  Words go in in English and come out (quite a while later) in Spanish.  No explanation is given, and the child is left wondering why Rabbit is using nonsense words.
I don't recommend this to any child with computer abilities.  They will find it boring at best, frustrating at worst."
"We've been using QuickBooks payroll for 14 years, upgrading when they did. The QB Payroll system works perfectly for our small businesses. We've had up to 50 people - and have been perfectly satisfied through all the years. With eFiling it's even easier!"
"I had doing my taxes, but who doesn't. TurboTax comes through for me year after year. Don't know the first year I used it but it was before Windows existed."
Brilliant game- kept the grandchildren occupied for hours - and they're still playing the game (and so are their parents)
"This is a fine product that I bought to use with my Win 8 computer (64 bit) system.  It replaced Parsons Address Book 2.0.  There were problems migrating the address lists to the new program and Jeff Elwood, the software developer, spent many hours helping me to convert these lists to the new format.  In all my years of computing, I have never had such fine customer service!  It was outstanding and ""above and beyond"" any other software I have purchased.  I recommend Jeff and his software without reservation!  Dave Kelly"
Product is described accurately and vendor service was very good.
I was disappointed because my Microsoft Picture It Publishing 2001 stopped working.  I was hoping this one would.  It seems they must have an expiration date for using them because all of them I have on various laptops and computers no longer work.  This one doesn't work either on any of my computers.
"I made a sea-change jump from VC++6.0 to Visual Studio 2008.  I miss my old ClassWizard, but it only took a day or so to get familiar with the new methods.  Probably the hardest thing to get used to is the change from Alt + E + I to launch Find-In-Files to using Ctrl + Shift + F.  Even after weeks of using VS2008, I still do the old key combination.

The executables produced are great and the program functions reliably.

I would easily buy it again."
"It was my fault that I received a product that was unuseable.  The product (Version 3) was priced at practically the same price as the newest version (Version 8), and I mistakenly assumed that I was getting the newest version.

It was incompatible with my needs.

Delivery response time was exceptional."
"Just a glorified calendar.  And, you must have the CD in your CD-DVD drive to be able the launch the application.  I understand the desire to protect copyright, but this is excessive and inconvenient.  The usefulness of the application does not justify this level of copy protection."
Listen all the time.
Was delivered fast and downloaded even faster.  Great business aid.
it was easy to use to the point. good guidance  steps  and  online help. I liked it a lot . will use it again.
Couldn't be happier. Worked great
"Have been using it for several years. It picks up last years information very successfully into this year's filing which is very helpful.

The one issue I had this year is once I filed Federal return I got the acceptance message but did not receive a processed message
to let me know my refund had been processed."
I recently upgraded my Quicken 2006!  I was afraid it was going to be difficult to learn a newer version of Quicken.  It has been so easy to make the transition. Thank you Quicken for your customer support and for this great helpful financial tool.
I have used H&R Block software for years.  Always happy with the results.  This year was no different.  I would recommend it to anyone doing their own taxes.
"Not for beginners. I'm not sure how many times it lets you download it, but I successfully downloaded and opened both the PC and the Mac versions on one serial number. The interface looks the same on both platforms, and is not easily intuitive. I can see it is built for professionals who might want to perform the same task on many photos at the same time. I mostly just crop and lighten, and it was not readily obvious to me how to do those tasks. On the Mac, iPhoto can crop and lighten easily, even fix some easy flaws. When PhotoShop became a monthly subscription, I switched to Photoshop Elements, which is the same price as this, and at least it has a Guided routine for idiots like me, and is easier to figure out. Not sure I would recommend this to anyone other than event and wedding photographers, but the price is reasonable if you have the patience to learn it. If you want free, there's still Gimp and Acorn (I think) that does very basic photo editing.

Update: the second time I worked with it, I found it puts an .xmp extension on the photo files so none of my other photo programs can open it, and I could not figure out how to do simple things like export a photo as just a .jpg or even close the file. So I got very aggravated that this program has such a steep learning curve."
The only anti virus I trust and the company is easy to work with with any issues/problems/questions pertaining to using their product or virus questions.
"I'm an auditor in public practice and I use quickbooks (on a PC) on a day to day at the office. I purchased a MAC for personal use and wanted to keep my personal financial information on a MAC because I feel that it's a safer environment. QB Mac does its job but definately does not compare to QB windows.

Also as an aside, I've experienced transition problems between MAC to Windows QB. When received MAC backups, I cannot restore them on PC QB.

For the price, I don't think the product is worth it."
"Went to local H&R Block last two years for Dad's 1040. So, this year I decided to get the program and play along. Big disappointment.
I'm use to turbotax - ten times easier."
"I used to think Intuit's customer service was really bad, but it has gotten much worse. If you need to download manual updates to TurboTax 2011 the web site says to contact customer service. I spent 34 minutes ""chatting"" with someone overseas who finally said she couldn't help, and then I spent 44 minutes holding on the telephone while a recording told me it would be just a minute longer and that I was a valued customer. After 44 minutes someone told me that although the web site said you can manually download TurboTax 2011 updates, you really can't. I was told Intuit made this change to improve the product. WTF.

I give this 2 stars because although the product appears OK, Intuit has the worst customer service of any company with which I've interacted."
"Non-returnable and non-refundable...waste of money, crashes on Win 7.64."

Have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for over 10 years.  It has never given me any problems.  The only tax program for me.

"The Best tutorial. Give yourself 60 day, 60 minutes a day and you'll be an expert."
"Easy to install on two computers. One area I am still a little unsure about is that I used Norton to replace another Internet Security program and the Norton does not appear to track or show possible intrusions as the other software did.  Now it could be that I have not had any intrusions, but given the number I had weekly using the other software I am a bit skeptical as to whether the Norton is preventing anything.  Everything seems to be working fine, but there is no reporting to reflect that it is in fact doing its job. Just a little nervous about that.  I had used Norton in the past and gave it up due to a lack of support, but decided to give it another try."
"What follows is the review of someone who has more than 25 years on both sides of the Unix/Windows line and who owns no stock that would benefit from the sales of either.
When you read all the reviews below, you might get confused, with ratings from 1 to 5 stars and the obvious pro- and anti-Microsoft commentary (this IS a Redhat review, right? Why do people feel compelled to throw in the Microsoft jabs?  Very juvenile!) - so if you're among the confused, let me help you out.
The clue to reality is found in the posts themselves - as you notice that the majority of reviewers feel obliged to tell you what kind of system they've installed (or not) Linux, right down to the drive types and the mouse pad they use.
Why do they feel you need this information, which anywhere else would be totally boring and even irrelevant?  Yes - you guessed it.  Linux still has problems supporting a number of hardware platforms and devices - period.  And, when new devices come out, Linux is slower than molasses in supporting them.
Well, this level of ""polish"", if that's the word I want, is what you get with a lot of ""open source"" software - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, often critical or obvious features are missing.  But hey - don't whine.  ""Everything is going to be fixed in the next version...would you please donate some money?""....
When Linux arrived on the scene, the CONCEPT was practically spiritual - at one point I thought the Congress might rewrite the Preamble to the Constitution to say that all men were entitled to life, liberty, LINUX and the pursuit of happiness.  It was all so very, very egalitarian.  Free stuff....well, until someone started charging for it.
It was the OS version of free love and hippie beads.
Years later, Linux still doesn't measure up.  It may sound like an oxymoron that Linux hides behind its ""openness"", but that is precisely what it does.  You're never entitled to scream VERY loud about its shortcomings, because, after all, it is free....or it only costs a few bucks, and hey - it's....OPEN!  Have some pity on the poor people who are working so hard to contribute to Linux, you heartless (grep .astard myreview > truth.txt).
Linux has promise.  In fact, lots of promises.  The fact that it's the same promises they were making years ago is merely a speedbump along the pathway to Nirvanalux.  And no matter how fast you drive it, Linux can never seem to outrun its kludge.
So, I run it - mostly as a development platform for work, before running anything on the real deal (Unix or Windows - the operating systems that actually work).  Crash my Linux, who cares?  I never compile anything on it that doesn't go to backup first.
And for those who claim constant crashes with Windows, I won't call them liars.  I have an NT server that I can't remember when I booted it, a 2000 server literally running from the day it was installed a couple of years ago, but then again, I RTFM and I'm a trained system administrator.  Could that be the difference?  Probably not - my wife's Windows 98 ran for about 6 years straight until she upgraded to 2000 and she has never seen the BSOD.
Notice I'm not telling you what platforms these systems are running on - because it doesn't matter.  If you're seeing the BSOD in Windows, the most probable device causing your failure is YOU."
"I used this tax program it makes an error.  My numbers are correct, but somehow it did a calculation error.  Now I am sitting on MN errors.  Ugh!"
"I am a MS Money fan so was quick to get the 05 version. Well I am uninstalling and rolling back to last years version!

First there is a new Internet Services Policy you must agree to. It starts out with ""Microsoft Money 2005 includes up to two (2) years of Internet-based Services. You will be able to use the Internet-based Services in Microsoft Money 2005 for a period of two (2) years from installation of the product or until September 1, 2007, whichever is earlier.""

Second the little Money Express program that reminds you of upcoming bills is gone.

I have 3 words for this program - Do Not Upgrade!

Stay With Your Current Version"
"It was great to have a GPS in Italy and the price of the SD card was fine. I was using a Garmin 760 GPS unit that works very well in the US. Nevertheless, I discovered that you should not expect it to work as well as it does with your US map. Too often, I found myself passing the exit before I could identify it from the GPS instructions. Probably, that was sometimes my own fault in trying to understand the mispronounced Italian street names that were identified with too much information--sort of like trying to read the overhead route directions that contained directions to several places, all in a foreign language.
The quirkiness of the guidance was annoying. For example, on one occasion I was on on a major road (comparable to an interstate road in the US) and the GPS said to drive on it for 60 miles.  I knew that to be correct, having been on the road before. I drove about 10 miles at about 80 miles an hour (yet being passed by the other drivers). Suddenly, the GPS started telling me to ""go 500 yards and make a legal U-turn."" I knew I had another 50 miles to go so I ignored that instruction (and it was a physical impossibility to make a U-turn on such a road). For another 5 minutes, it kept telling me to make that U-turn, after which it stopped doing so and reflected the fact that I had another 45  miles to go to my destination.
Despite these issues, I recommend the SD card for anyone driving in Italy. Overall, it did its job, and if you realize it is quirky, you will be OK. It is not perfect, but it is better than trying to read foreign maps and asking for directions when there is a language barrier. If nothing else, its pronunciation of Italian street names will keep you amused."
"Wow, what can I say?  Been looking for a simple recording system for our old Sony HanycamVision HI8 movie camera bought back in 2000 to convert the tapes to DVD.  I knew all along there was something out there.  Well, here it is.  Everything worked as advertised. There are a couple of hiccups, of course.  But if you have a little patience everything will be just fine.  Remember that you will be recording at the tape speed, not 4x, 8x, 24x etc.... So, sit back and enjoy your old home movies or whatever tape you are recording.  The Dazzle itself is very simple to use as well as the software Pinnacle Studio 12.  To use all of the features of Pinnacle Studio 12 you will have to register the product online.  This is recommended because if you decide not to, many of the features will be grayed out and a warning box stating you need to register online will appear if not.  So, make sure the computer you are using has an internet connection.  Definitely make sure the Dazzle will work on the computer you choose first.  Go ahead and install Pinnacle Studio 12 without registering and make sure it will capture and save your tape recording.  If it doesn't work, find out why and or use another computer.  This way you won't have to dink around with the problem of the serial number / activation key if you have to use another computer.  This is what I do know it works on perfectly: Sony HandycamVision model CCD-TRV88 NTSC using HI8 tapes and converting to DVD-R on computer system:  Toshiba laptop model A665-S6086 using Windows 7 64bit, 4gigs ram, Intel Core I3.  I chose this over my other computers that run XP or Ubuntu on 32 bit os.  So, 64 bit ran great. No problems with the webcam either, as some people have mentioned. Things to look out for that I ran into:  S video, as another person pointed out, will not fit properly into the Dazzle itself.  Interesting, huh?  Bad design.  Luckily I have may different S video cables and just screwed the protective sleeve off of the end of one and was able to make it work just fine.  Otherwise it will be composite only.  When you are ready to start your recording, I would recommend turning off your internet connection and disable your virus program.  This way it will help keep some of your other programs from trying to do background processes while recording.  My problem:  I have Norton and it loves to run background scans when it thinks nothing is happening.  Problem is, it can be taxing if you know what I mean.  When it started up it immediately messed up the sync of the audio to video while recording.  Audio was 1 to 2 seconds behind the video. I wouldn't be surprised if other programs could cause this too.  So look out for this.  Just be sure you are not online when disabling your virus program.  You can try silent mode with Norton, but if you have been at it for hours don't take a chance at this frustration.  Also, make sure you are using USB 2.0 or you will get a warning saying it needs the speed of this.  No USB 1.1.  I found this out trying to use an older laptop from 2005.  I tried to use this with USB 1.1, Windows XP 32 bit, 1 gig of ram, Intel Celeron 1.7 ghz, No Way!  Don't waste your time on this.  If you use maxium quality, which is pretty darn good if you ask me from HI8 to DVD-R, I was only able to get about an hour on a 4.7gig DVD.  Crazy, huh?  Or you can cram many hours at lower quality.  If you have the patience and the ability to follow the directions, life will be good with Dazzle. Remember:  You will need lots of hard drive space too, unless you use the option of direct to DVD feature.  But this leaves no room for error, like some other program screwing up the audio/video sync. Good luck."

"This game DOES NOT work on all 4 of my laptops.  I am very disappointed!  This was a favorite game of mine years ago and I ""thought"" the description gave me enough information that it would work on Windows 7.  It certainly doesn't!"

"i rated the other similar 9.0 2005 old version - i don't know what [LB] stands  for except that it would work better on hard drives of that type formatted in that way [large base? [size,... of sectors?]], as i have recently done, but haven't got that new ones modem up + going yet with XP. ...Well, hmmm. Customer servive? Sucks REALLY BADLY. Don't even waste time talking to them online. They take control of your pc, and opnly make  problem worse. DAYS of time wasted, and no solution. Phone support? It's a little better, but only avlbl m-f 8-5 i believe. And if you need their number , they are in Plano TX and you want the 866 number toll free, so when you call the 800 number (might be under network  associates) that it is for businesses , so when it tells you to puch option 1 for retail, it gives the 866 number in Plano, TX. By the way, the online chat is SLOW as hech to even get started up worth it. And if you delete cookies nd need to relogin since setup, they may have reset your password without even asking or telling you. I believe the chat is really comprised of foreigners with questionable english skill(s)? It is full of auto-reply niceties. Its been a couple weeks and still no solution or help from them. What good is bying 2 CD's when you are unable to get DAT file updates? Furthermore, the autoupdate pops up, even unseen in the background, all the time-- even when you turn in off, and it says it is supposed to be off. If you are slowing down a lot, do CNTRL+ALT+DEL and shut it down forcefully. And don't think you can defragment your drive for maintenance by exiting the the tray icon. Oh, no. Must close down all 4 running Mc-anythings using CNTL+ALT+DEL several more times. It was soooo refreshing to uninstall after reinstalling and everyother thing they told me to try. Ran sooo much quicker, even opening files, folders, calculator-- anything. 6 startup entries gone with the wind. Downloaded AVGfree and runs so much nicer and faster. AMAZING that they want to make it so hard to give you updates that you pay for, and will not. Apparently, they said you could put it on 2 pc's, which i did not, but another said you could not. I have an email reminding me to renew, with all their other spam, yet they have altered my account to show i was never signed up. You have to sign up, and give and use an email. Much cheaper than buyig online direct though. If you have at least a 1 Gz (P III) processor, it is not so bad  on autoupdate, and yet it will tell you when asked that you are up to date and protected and when you log in, and maunually check, it downloads updates, so apparently it was NOT up up date. They should TELL you that you need to use 2 different emails for 2 different pc's. Surely , i am not the only one with more than 1 pc? And god help you if you forget your password. So, both online and when i called they dais myone email had nothing signed up, when i have now an email from them telling me to renew. Gee, i wonder how that could be. Liars!!!

The software AND the support is dishonest and not trustworthy.

And if it ever turns dark-colored maroon, and you read online where they tell you it is ""nothing to worry about""-- don't fall for that one. Don't you believe them."
I had no problems in renewing Norton security deluxe. I recommend this product.
Just wanted to print envelopes and had lost my other program due to computer malware.  This installed quickly and was free.  This even let you had some design.
I have have many many hrs of great reading.  Thank u.  I would and have told many of my friends about this site.
"15 years ago, when I was old enough to buy my first PC, I chose Norton as my antivirus.  It was pretty good software, lightweight and powerful.  Over the years security products evolved with more features, and while Norton added those features, it got bogged down by them and became more bloated and slower.  I stopped using Norton products several years ago when this line was called systemworks, but decided to give 360 a shot on my Windows 7 PC.

Installation was fairly simple, and there isn't much to configure, which can be good for novice users.  I personally would prefer more options.  The software is pretty and seems pretty friendly.  It handles antivirus and malware protection, system cleaning, and even annoying popups on my browser to ""warn of unsafe websites"".  Although there are programs out there that use fewer resources, this version of Norton seemed much easier on my system.

I am a bit concerned over not getting to use the software in 1 year if I don't ""renew my subscription"".  I will probably not do that, but we will see.  For now though, the software meets my requirements and doesn't slow down the PC much.  Recommended if you need security software."
So nice to have all my music in one place and when I buy a CD from Amazon if it qualifies they put it right in my music for me. I haven't used iTunes in quite a while and I used to love it.  The Prime music is absolutely great.  I love the whole thing!!!!!!

"I know that there aren't any anti virus for tablets yet, but I thought this had it is the reason why I bought it. On the box it says ""Compatible with Android & Apple IOS Tablets, IPhone & IPad"" (under operating systems.)This only means you can get the ""App"" for the Secure website Browser - for browsing securely on the net. I'm about to upgraded to Lion on my Mac & once I do, I will install this anti virus & will update! my review."

"As is a habit of mine, I tend to troll movie sites in my free time, checking up on news and seeing what's being filmed where, who's in what, and so on. In March, [...] had a spotlight on Natasha Richardson to commemorate her life and acting achievements--it has been one year since she passed. Looking at her filmography I noticed that Wild Child was last movie she made. I began combing websites like Wal*Mart and Target for the movie, but it is not sold in stores. I wasn't going to buy a movie solely because it was Natasha Richardson's final appearance without first making sure it was half-way decent. Thank the Lord for movie websites. That is how I was, finally, able to sit down and watch this movie. I have watched interviews with the cast and behind the scenes videos all over Youtube and one thing is for sure: I love this movie. Call me crazy, but me, a college student, is completely enamored with it.

Looking at the film in scope, is it original, no, it is not. It is kind of a twist on Mean Girls meets a British Academy for young ladies. There is nothing especially remarkable about this film--not in the slightest, which is why I only give it three stars, but that rating merely reflects the film as a public whole. Personally, for me, this film is way better than Mean Girls was. Mean Girls was raunchy and I was about ready to strangle Rachel McAdams for just about everything. You see, I believe that movies only work if the characters are dynamic--static characters are a waste of everyone's time and money whether literature or silver screen. The character's in this movie are not static--even the snotty head girl has to deal with change.

It is recommended that this movie would only be good for preteens up through thirteen years of age--personally, I wouldn't let a child watch this until they were thirteen years of age. The crudeness of British vocabulary and Poppy's mouth was, at first, startling; I know Emma Roberts as the beloved detective Nancy Drew, not as a teenager I would personally tie to chair for her attitude. As such, though, is Emma Roberts' character, and having seen her do nothing like this and be completely out of her element in the British countryside was an eye-opener. For sure, Emma Roberts can be the brat as she can be the darling and she does, by the end of this film make that predicted transformation. She does, of course, push the limits along the way.

All-in-all, the heartwarming nature of the story contained within this roll of film is one I find worth paying for, every cent. Emma Roberts is a delight and British cast, most of whom I had never seen before outside of Natasha Richardson, as the meadmistress, and the matron (most notably Moaning Myrtle in the Harry Potter series) and who were a delight to watch interact. The male lead was handed off to one Alex Pettyfer [upcoming Beastly] and while his role was small, he held his own within the film amongst all the other ladies; I applaud him for his bravery. Natasha Richardson, though, with even a smaller role than Alex, who plays her son, was a delight to watch light up the screen. It was almost like seeing her in a new movie and that she really still was out there, making movies and being a doting wife and mother. Her final role is a character that is a tribute to her as a person and as gentle a leader as her role as Liz from the Parent Trap all those years ago. While I do wish she had played a larger part, her character was integral for the story to move forward and it made it worth while.

If you are looking for a movie that is sassy, full of quirky quotes that I personally love (allusions to Alice in Wonderland), and laughter as notorious as my own, Wild Child is a movie I recommend with no hesitations. As long as you understand that you are getting a comedy that is entirely British in nature, but with a heart that can be distinguished from neither country--buy Wild Child. Enjoy Emma Roberts as a brat and then a starlet and watch Natasha Richardson's final performance, one that deserves more credit than it received.

"It works. I'm using it right now. However this software isn't perfect. I haven't used it extensively, but I realize that as it learns and has more time to adapt to my vocabulary and voice, the program will become better suited to my needs. However it is big obstacle to overcome the training. and also annoying to have to proofread what it typed in order to ensure that the program faithfully recorded 100% the words I spoke. For me this program was supposed to save much time, however I fear that it wasn't worth the price. Yet, this may change as I go to school and begin to dictate my papers and other documents. I give it four stars just for the sheer cool factor, yet  of five because this isn't the future -- yet."
"This program was an excellent addition to my girl friend's experience in learning English.  She was drawn into active use of the tool through the use of colorful and interesting photos as well as choices presented to her.  I saw her struggling to stay awake while using another program.  There were some occasional difficulties in getting through certain pronunciations.  However, staying awake was not a problem with Rosetta Stone.  This tool is a valuable component to anyone's study of a new language."
I have used Norton Utilities for years and purchased this latest version to upgrade.  I depend on it to help resolve issues on my computer.
"I love Quickbooks, and I can't imagine using any other accounting software. It is simple to upload and download excel documents, which is a feature I use frequently. Everything about Quickbooks is simple, intuitive, efficient, and headache free. I recommend Quickbooks to all small business owners. If you want to save money and do your own bookkeeping, look no further. This software is perfect, as you won't spend a lot of precious time keeping up with the books, and you will always have a clear picture of the financial aspect of your company."
"I used to use Poser MANY years ago (God only knows what version it was, but I don't think they had animation yet!) So I'm coming back to it now, and there have been so many changes (and it's been such a long time) that it's more like learning a new program than anything else. Poser has amazing capabilities. You are not stuck with buying thousands of dollars' worth of props and models if you ever want to do anything with it (which is what a lot of people seem to think.) And yes, you can create your own characters, props, materials, walk cycles, etc etc etc...

 The major, MAJOR problem I have with 2010 is that it is absolutely and completely impossible to get the Poserfusion plugin to work with Cinema 4D r14. That is not a good situation. Then, when you get to the page on the SmithMicro site that supposedly has a plugin, you get the thrilling experience of entering the serial number from the back of the CD sleeve about 100 times and checking it over and over and over again and still being told that it's the wrong one. I'm still trying to get through to tech support about this. So that's a real issue. If this plugin is supposed to be part of what you're buying, then it needs to work.

Overall, though, what makes this so worthwhile is the fact that once the next edition came out, this one dropped to literally 1/10th of the price, something that normal human beings can actually afford. This is something that all software manufacturers desperately need to learn from (and maybe one day they'll wise up. I wonder how much revenue they'll have to lose to piracy before they figure this one out??)"

It was a bit trying at first, but then I got  DIRECTIONS FROM THE HELP AND THE TUTORIAL SECTIONS. You must read the directions carefully but it's worth the time it took to learn it which was about 2 days. I LOVE IT!!! I was able to add some amazing morphs to my movies. I'd be willing to bet those who rated this poorly didn't bother to read the directions!"

"While I have used earlier versions of Dragon Naturally speaking, I find version 11 far more user friendly and intuitive.  The training time is surprisingly short. As a publisher of a monthly newsletter, I really needed help when I broke my wrist recently.  Dragon Naturally Speaking gave me the ability to continue my work, publishing my newsletter without any problem.  I really recommend it to anyone that has problems with keyboard entry, or who are simply tired of typing all the time."

I do not understand all the hate on Windows 8. It is a much snappier OS than Windows 7. 8.1 brought a lot of good fixes to 8.
"Edit: Back to Windows 7.

Windows 8 is a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. I guess that is not entirely true, it is a solution for a problem Microsoft has, not I.

The UI is flashy and gets in the way. It wants to be notice. I don't want to notice my OS. It should be invisible so I can get what I need to done. I don't want to interact with it, play with it. I had to search for regedits to make my synaptics touchpad not trigger the charm bar if I even scrapped the left side of the pad. Either that or install a generic driver.

No native drivers for igfx by intel, windows provided one crashes and resets. When it resets, any video that would be playing in a browser would only play audio. The fix is to close and reopen the browser.

A November update came along. EVERYTHING slowed down for me. My SSD was relegated back to HDD speeds. Browser took a good 5 seconds to open, as did OneNote/Word/Excel. ON W7, which I am back on now? Instantaneous. Another update broke all my Metro apps. Repair function in the store did nothing to repair it. Uninstalling and reinstalling the apps did nothing to repair it. Refreshing the computer would leave the apps in tact and would do nothing to repair it.

Search - inefficient and unreliable. 0 matches in apps, 5 matches in settings, 10 in files. Lets display apps where there are 0 apps! Makes sense! Quite frequently the search wouldn't bring up a result until I finished spelling the whole thing, completely. One letter from completion, nothing. Enter final letter, there it is. Makes no sense.

Training consumers for ads - Minesweeper, Xbox Music, advertisements. Xbox music will match your music and serve up the censored version from their servers rather than play the one locally from your drive so they can serve you ads. Ads in minesweeper? No thanks. Give me back the low graphics ad free one. It is plain as day where MS is going with this and I do not like it one bit.

Workflow - extremely disruptive. Changing the entire screen to open something up messes up your train of though, especially when working in number intensive programs or you are in the certain place in a long document. Much like how I forget what I was going to do when I enter a room. What did I come here to get again? Happens a lot for me, especially when I'm working on something monotonous.

Cleaning up after install. I really don't like having icons pollute the startup screen after an install. It is unnecessary and annoying and indicates a lack of polish.

2 different browsers. How is this a good idea? 2 different browsers, each with their own history, extensions, bookmarks, etc. Why deal with this added complexity? I ended up forcing Chrome to disable the Metro browser because I did not want every link I clicked in anything remotely connected to metro popping up that browser. That worked well for a while until I went into Metro mode for whatever reason and got permanently stuck in Metro mode. I'm not blameless in that one because maybe my regedit had something to do with it.

No clock. Seems small but it was annoying not having a clock viewable at all times. Full screen mode=no taskbar=no clock. I tried to compromise with an app called the Time but that thing leaked memory like crazy, upwards of 1GB in ram by a clock used up.

The mousing around. OMG, the mousing around. All this dragging and sliding and flinging. I'm not here to play around. If my workflow requires mostly mouse inputs, then I won't have my hands on the keyboard. Shortcuts are inefficient so I have to click and drag, click and drag. Hit a hot corner and carefully go down so it doesn't lose focus. Everything requires further mouse travel. Right click is inconsistent, always a surprise. Back button on mouse is inconsistent. Sometimes it goes back, sometimes it doesn't.

Metro App startup times. I thought these things were lightweight but some of them take 4-5 seconds to startup. I thought they were going for Android startup speeds, near instantaneous.

I could go on. It makes me angry that a lot of people are dismissive of other users concerns. Oh, they are just parroting what some tech blog said. I assure you I am not. I am frustrated because I have wasted hours and hours of my life trying to get the OS to do what I want it to do.

The speed slowdown plus my browser being stuck was the last straw and I uninstalled Windows 8. I like W7. Windows 8 is like a service pack with some great improvements but a lot of added, unremovable baggage. I loved the pastel coloring and the flatness of Windows 8, I found it a lot more attractive and clean than W7. I loved the explorer ribbon interface which made everything more efficient to get to. I loved the file management system and how I could pause and start each transfer individually.

In short, I would have had no problem upgrading for $100+ to Windows 8 minus metro rather than this $40 waste of hours of my life. Maybe these issues will be resolved in the future, maybe they won't. Bottom line is I found the experience unpleasant."

"Downloaded and installed on my Mac running Mavericks 10.9.2 No Problems. Downloaded and installed TurboTax Updates as of 03/26/14. Returns from prior year carried over, no problems. Completed Fed and CA State returns and Efiled, no problems.

With regard to the ""hidden fee"", you do NOT need to accept what they are trying to sell you (the TurboTax Plus for $39.99) For California filers, pay the $24.99 CA Efile fee separately.

The price of this product includes Fed and State returns and Fed Efile for $49.99. California filers pay the Efile fee separately. A good value, you will save money with this package. Total cost to get all my taxes done and Efiled $74.98 AWESOME!"
"IT WAS A GOOD BUY,BUT STILL WASNT ABLE TO OPEN THE GARAGE BAND,SO JUST WAITIN TO FIND SOMEONE WHO CAN OPEN IT FOR ME THANKS."
"I used this program last year and plan to use it again this year.  I was always wary about doing my taxes on my own.  (don't EVER want a tax audit!)  But this thing was so easy to use, and there are ways to double check all your work.  I felt very confident that everything was right when I sent it in, and a little proud that I did it myself!"
I'm very pleased. I received my game on time and it was wrapped in the original packaging. It's working smoothly. If the game ever shuts off on you it would have to be a computer problem. Definitely a great buy!
I still have yet to use all the progams provided but for the price this is a great buy.
"Once I figured out how to use it, I found this product fairly powerful in its ability to generate labels.  I especially liked the ability to edit individual labels once generated.  The program is pretty flexible although I was dismayed at the number of features that it lacked such as allowing access to every single Address Book field (it only lets you use Spouse Name but not Friend or Assistant, for example).  There are other features that are found in Microsoft Word's label applet that are more powerful, such as using Boolean logic to be able to generate more complete labels.  Of course, if Pages, AppleWorks or even (God forbid) Address Book had a real label making feature, there would be no need to shell out the extra bucks for this program!
Now, my real complaint, which is about the company.  They put out two products- Labels & Envelopes and Business Cards.  Clearly they are both the same product with only subtle differences, such as the templates that they come with.  Business Cards does not even allow access to the Address Book, other than one's own personal entry (even though they imply that they do).  They should combine both products into one and maybe charge a little more than the cost of one for it.
A good product that does do this is Print Explosion but unfortunately it does not access Address Book."

"Amazon may suck worse than MS! Trying to install Windows 10 in OS X boot camp. I already own a valid Windows 10 Pro download key and USB, but I bought the download from Amazon because Microsoft download of iOS hangs an all platforms except Microsoft. I already have a valid Windows 10 Pro key (!) but I can't use it because the download hangs indefinitely on any platform but MS. In desperation I bought the Windows 10 Home key & download from Amazon in expectation of a valid download. But that took me to the MS download site, which still hangs indefinitely on any platform but Windows! So I have two Windows keys purchased fromAmazon! but can't download Windows software to let me use them!!!

Never buying windows again if I can help it, and totally never buying from Amazon. Spent $300 with Amazon for Windows 10 software, and nothing at all to show for it!!!

"I ordered this Norton Antivirus for 2012 last year. I installed it and love it. However, I think its time for me to upgrade."
Pricey. Good quality. Shipped in timely fashioned. What is neat about this is that you can install this up to 3 computers (like family packet or something). Five star for product doing exactly what is expected from it. It is still expensive and can certainly be cheaper. All these brand name stuffs...
The best sales training ever!!!!!!!  Spent 25 years in Dupont and Dow Chemical - a great aid to our commercial execution!!
"The updated version is a huge step backward. It's clunky, counter-intuitive, and definitely user unfriendly. The slide-open windows are terrible. And I still haven't been able to figure out what happened to my playlists that were populated with dozens of songs from Amazon Prime. I so wish I could go back to the previous version.

[Update 11/29/2016:] The newest update still has problems. It continues to forget all of the songs in my Prime Music Playlist. I have over 100 songs in the playlist. But when I open the program and select that playlist, only three of my songs are listed. It also says the three songs are over 6 hours long.  Total fail. An Amazon rep told me to sign out, quit the program, then relaunch and sign in again. The workaround works, but it's a pain having to do it every time I want to listed to songs in my playlist."
"Just ok, not great. The latest version for Macs stinks!!! I went with iBank."
"This is a decent addition to your Mac, but I still ended up paying more to buy the Microsoft Office for Mac. It's much more useful and adaptable to various uses and platforms. It's much easier to stick to the industry standard."
Huummm pretty good for the price only thing was my 14 year old didn't like the look of the after video he created for YouTube saying that the framework was slow
This was a really hard game to find out! I was so much wanting to find out who did it I kept playing for hours. The most I ever played was 5 hours in a row! I finally won it! I think you should really try this one! I think that you should be at least 12 though because it is really hard.
this is a great product

"I have to admit I was worried initially since I couldn't spoof my Garmin here in CA to pretend we were already in France to see if the maps for France would work.  But, once we picked up the rental car in Paris and plugged in my trusty Garmin, it knew exactly where we were and showed us the way out of Paris.  Worked great the rest of the trip and was a real lifesaver.  We had our Michelin maps along just in case, but we only used them to get a larger lay of the land prior to exploring the regions we visited.  I'm still amazed at the technology that allows me to visit almost any country in the world and have an interactive road guide that tells me how to get to my target destinations."
"I have used the ""Tax Cut"" and H&R Block software for several years. The Federal forms are pretty good the forms for my State taxes (Idaho) are lacking several of the forms I needed. I had to down load them from the state website so of course these weren't calculated into the mix and I had to do this by hand. So since then I've just bought the Federal, but this year Wal-Mart only offers the Federal & State combined forcing you to buy the state forms whether they will work for you or not. So I am glad to find a place where I can at least down load just the federal tax software. (I'd rather have a disc.)"

"Not sure what all the bad reviews are about.  I upgraded from 2011 Premier and it worked flawlessly.  Conversion worked quickly and flawlessly.  Software is LOT faster than my 2011 version.  Sometimes it would take several minutes to update my accounts in the 2011 version.. this one updated in probably under a minute.  I hate the fact quicken forces you to upgrade and actually disables online account updating from financial institutions every couple of years, but it sure makes tracking everything in one place nice.  No issues here with the upgrade.."
Straightforward and simple!
"The business program would not handle the balance sheet properly with new assets put in place.  It also had several error notations that were not errors at all.  Due to some of these errors the return could not be efiled.  I spent several hours with different premium customer service personal who could not help me.  A couple of them admitted that the program has problems they cannot resolve.  The premium individual program worked as usual.  Ok, but not great.  For basic returns it would be great.  But, for more complex returns some questions are not clear and the program is limited in handling certain situations for proprietorships or partnerships.  It is also difficult to maneuver back and forth through the program if you are need to go back to update sections."
I have been using Quicken for over 10 years and purchased this product to replace my 2009 version of Quicken. I was disappointed to learn that the 2013 version combines/changes the features of the budget and savings goals. I am no longer able to bucket my money like I use to. I have since decided not to continue using the 2013 version and resume use of my 2009 version (though it is no longer supported).

"After several versions of Act and other Sage products, it's time to call it quits! Tech support in India is horrible, both in voice quality and also in understandability. My problem started after Act was upgraded to ver10, which they don't tell you works using SQL server. My problem which should be simple one to correct, the ACT address book will not install in Outlook 2007, that's it. And they can't fix it and this was after 5-6 hours on tech support calls, uninstalling and reinstalling the software. Plus my time and working with Microsoft (which was great support) Boils down to get my money back and moving to Business contact manager from Microsoft."
"Terribly designed program, always crashes my other programs and the editing features are glitchy. Im going back to premier or final cut studio."
After close to a year of using this product I still find it frustrating and inferior to past versions.  For the most part I don't like the menu structures.
what a shame.
This is the 4th or 5th version I've used and it really helped my typing.
"Best Music APP Ever! Easy downloads, great previews, and offers are unbeatable. This is the app that makes me want to have Prime Membership!"
I always use TurboTax to do my Federal and state return.  It makes it so easy to follow.
Works just fine. I'd buy again when I need to.
Very old copy and technology and it does not integrate with other software. Very disappointment in both the vendor and AMAZON.
"I use this software in two HP PC's, a Surface and a Dell laptop.  In all 4, the software freezes (""Not Responding"") very frequently. 75% of the time you'll have to close your work and deal with the 'recovered file'.  25% of the time you lose your work.  Mega annoying.  Wish I would've stayed with Office 2011."
I ran this on an older desk top and it listed and cleaned up 346 items. Has a few nice options and computer seems quite a bit faster.
"This program doesn't break down the deductions and credits very well. You don't know what exactly to put in what deduction or credit. Turbo Tax has it though, turbo tax is about 20 times easier to use."
Very Disapointed

"Am I out of date or is this program not for middle school?  First, the work that was being asked of my daughter she did in elementary school, then I was not been able to find a way to get to the level she was working at without going step by step starting at the first level and it is like pulling teeth to get her to work on the lower levels.  She is going into 7th grade and I wanted her to review some 6th grade work and learn more this summer but that probably won't happen.  There should be some way to get to an appropriate level but without a manual I have not been able to find it. This program is not very user friendly."
I found this product to be very adequate in its performance and it is very easy to install and log on to.
"Ridiculous rip off. The TurboTax Basic software only allows you to file the 1040EZ form. Nobody should have to pay anything to file a 1040EZ. There are lots of free software available to file simple tax forms. Heck, even TubroTax offers their ""Freedom Edition"" online where you can file basic tax forms for free. Skip this product."
Excellent transaction. Received timely and in advertised condition. I would do business with this seller again.
"worthless piece of garbage. if you're not selling something that's intuitive to use, you at least owe your customer clear instructions and advice on usage. if you have a laymen's grasp of computers, save yourselves 10 bucks and a couple hours trying to make it work and invest in a sledgehammer and safety goggle."
"As a parent of two kids, I became increasingly concerned that my ever expanding collection of videotaped (VHS-C) family movies would erode over time due to oxidation of film surfaces.  With that in mind, I recently purchased a Dell XPS 400 (Dual Core Pentium D Processor, 1 GB RAM)PC and had decided on the Pinnacle Studio Plus 9 AV/DV software and PCI card package in which to initiate the VHS-C transfer to DVD project. I have been using the software for nearly a week and am very satisfied with the results.

The Pinnacle package comes with a PCI card (that is mounted in an available slot in the PC), software, a ""blueBox"" and cables.  The blueBox is an interface that allows you to connect a VCR or camera in which to deliver the analog signal to the PC.  The software has three primary tabs: Capture, Edit and Make Movie. The first step is to capture the analog source.  The capture tab has a ""Diskometer"" with two fly-out panels so that you can monitor memory usage and adjust the audio and video settings of the captured source.  Next, the edit tab allows one to create chapters, albums, special effects, etc.  There are so many features in the edit tab that I've still yet to explore all of them.  If one desires a straight unedited version of the video, you need only to click and drag the frames into the toolboxes and move on to the Make Movie tab. Once you've selected the desired digital media (i.e. DVD, VCD) and quality of resolution, the tab renders the video into final form (which can take a half hour or more for a high quality DVD on a fast computer)and burns the video onto a disk.

I have made several DVDs at this point and have not experienced any dropped frames in videos or PC system crashes.  I think it certainly helps to have a powerful PC that is up to the task of video capturing (be forewarned, however, video capturing is a big time memory hog.  I am contemplating on getting a 250 GB external hard drive just for my video clips). The finished DVD quality is really quite astounding.  I now have a piece of mind that I am able to preserve valuable video movies on a more permanent and durable media.

I would whole-heartedly recommend the Pinnacle package to anyone that is interested in transfering VHS tapes to DVDs.  Just make sure you meet the minimum system requirements outlined on the package (even so, you may want to upgrade PC specifications)and to take the time to learn the software (a 290 page book comes with the package)."
I have small business and QuickBooks has helped me organize the finances in and easy manner. It connects with my bank account and has all the features I need.
"I am a long tim user of quicken for windows. I have been using Quicken 2015 fro Mac for a few weeks now. Basic checkbook appears to work. I can't say as much about tracking investments. I figure I have to invest several hours fixing the data import. Need a rainy day to tackle that.

I am totally amazed that Quicken for Mac lags so far behind the level of the Windows version. I have paid for many version of Quicken and this is the third version for Mac that I have tried."

The programming is downright sloppy. loaded with errors. Game graphics bug out continuously. There are some privacy invading elements as well to these games. Guess you get what you pay for. Worst money I've spent.
Very well done!
"I've been using TurboTax (formerly MacInTax) for over 16 years now. Highly recommended to someone looking to do their own taxes easily.

Expecting the average user to immediately dive into advance printer reconfiguration of print spoolers and RAW data conversion is unrealistic and something the other major software developers have mastered - unlike NOVA Development. Roll the dice and take your chances. I removed the software after 3 hours of troubleshooting and requested a refund from PayPal. Even if NOVA doesn't cooperate, I'll forfeit the $30 and free-up my time for software that works.

Postscript: NOVA doesn't offer after hours support."

This is a great and inexpensive way to practice and learn German!
"No problems at all, wish price would drop a little."
Worked great untill the subscription ran out. Now I can't get the pop-up notice to stop. They don't my OS any more so I can't buy a new one.
I received the downloaded edition and it downloaded perfectly even over satellite internet connection. I always recommend TurboTax to evryone. Have used TT every year since 2005. Have had no problems.
"I have had this program for about a year now.  This is my second copy (cant find my first one).  I LOVE this program and so does my daughter!  It works just like it says it does!!  I haven't bought a ringtone or graphic since I first got it.  You can take any song or picture and make a ringtone or graphic out of it! I have made graphics for my phone from all kinds of pictures on the web.  It is a really cool program!  Very easy to use, instructions are very clear and easy to follow. Support at the website is a bit hard to navigate but its very rare that you need it.  I first got it to use with my razr V3 and now my daughter and I use it for my Blackjack 2 and her Tilt.  It says to make a ringtone no longer than 15 to 20 seconds, we have pushed it to 35 seconds.  I would recommend this to anyone who changes ringtones and graphics on their phones like my daughter and I do. I LOVE THIS PROGRAM!!!!"
Dragon ~Speak  lives up to its reputation this is a quality product makes dictation and the task of writing so much simpler. Who knew? Get off the fence and get this if your typing it now you will wonder what took you so long. By far the best way to interface with a computer and save time. The learning curve is always a factor but after a couple days of practice it becomes a breeze. I was the same guy who said a camera and a phone together that's never going to work. Make your life easier get your own Dragon. You will get more done and spend less time at your computer and more time living your life. Comes bundled with McAfee both on separate CD loads easily. I don't need the McAfee product I just wanted the Dragon the price sold me at the time. Always something new this has about everything you would want works all platforms and OS to date 3-1-2016.
This software is excellent for academic citing for research purposes. It work beautifully with Microsoft Word.
"Used turbotax as long as I can remember it is a great product.  People are giving bad reviews because the price went up.  Its worth every penny if you ask me.  Turbo Tax is welcome to raise their price if they want to.  What's another few bucks anyways?  Its accurate & much cheaper than paying some quickie place that plugs the numbers into the computer for you.  Plus, if you use this year after year you gain a better understanding about taxes in general.  Anyways, all these bad reviews are about price, not the product."
"I have 3 machines that I have installed PC Matic on.  an XP, Windows 7, and Windows 8.  PC Matic has discovered numerous issues on all three including virus's that Norton's didn't find and removed them.  I have PC Matic scheduled to run nightly on all machines and performance is better."
Avast has been an excellent antivirus program--am very happy with the protection.
"We purchased this game for our daughters, 6 & 8.  They both absolutely love it.  It allows them to use their imaginations to set up not only the fashions but the models, the music and the stage for the show, etc.  They love watching the show at the end because they created it all by themselves.  The reason I came online and wrote this review is because I am now purchasing this for my 6 year old niece."
"These are wonderful card games. I especially like that I can play cards with my Mom and sisters (who live in different states) and chat at the same time! It's like sitting around the kitchen table at my Mom's house (one of the rooms is even a kitchen)!!! If you love to play cards, this game is for you."
"Although it has some great features, especially the auto detect for harware configuration, you should be prepared to replace several pieces of hardware on your computer.  I ended up having to replace my video card.  At this point my cd burner won't work and scanner does not have a driver update for XP.  Now before you scold, these items are name brand - Iomega cd burner and Visioneer scanner.
Overall I would only suggest putting XP on a totally new system and not upgrading an existing computer."
"Due to a Windows change, I needed to upgrade my accounting software and the cost for this was next to nothing.  I tried to use it for about two weeks and found it terribly unfriendly.  It bogged down my computer, required a constant internet connection and was almost impossible to learn.  And I am no slouch when it comes to accounting products.  I really didn't want to buy Quickbooks again but ended up getting a higher version of QB anyway and just forgetting the money I spent on this."
"It is technically one of the best, however it suffers a milder degree of the bloat others like Norton and Mcafee have been plagued by for years and it does NOT like to play well with other malware software. Maybe it would be OK for someone with basic knowledge of computers but only uses one for basic tasks and no on line purchases or banking, as I have heard too many horror stories about substandard protection and would never use this all by it's lonesome as it hates other anti-malware utilities."
"The program installed fine. After that it was downhill.  The learning curve for this application is extremely high. Don't be fooled by the commercials-- you will not be up and running anytime soon.  I spent hours training the voice commands (and doing the tutorial) and still got it to open and run what i wanted it to only half the time. My frustration with repeating commands was a huge issue. The headset they supplied was of poor quality and I got better results with an old one I had.  Navigating  around the Desktop was
almost impossible and an exercise in frustration.  Once word or the internet was open, wrong words were inserted and editing was painful.  The program took over sound settings even when it wasn't running and when I was using skype it would arbitrarily reduce my mic volume and I could barely be heard. Bottom line: if you are still ok with using your mouse and have 50 hours to spend learning and training voice recognition, with no noticeable increase in speed or productivity... This is the program for you. If not skip it... until good voice recognition technology is available.  I gave it away it was so bad."
"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT, I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS WITH IT, IT CONTINUES TO QUIT WORKING WHEN I TRIED TO GET HELP IT WAS A JOKE ,THE SOFTWARE ISN,T EVEN LISTED ON THE WEB SITE FOR DOWNLOADING ,EVEN THOUGH I REGISTERED IT THE WEB SITE TELLS ME I HAVE NO ACC.

"I had been a Pinnacle studio user since version 9. 8 months ago I got Avid Studio - it was a program not ready for ""prime time"".

My system is a AMD 945 quad core, a ATI 5570 1 Gig video care, 4 Gig's memory and about 3 t'bytes of storage free. I could not get Avid studio to render a file longer than 15 minutes in ACHD 1920 x 1080. Sony Vegas does it without a problems (so far up to an hour of content). The price on Vegas 11 HD suite is amazing ($81 here on amazon prime).

I'm having to learn the system, but Vegas and its supporting products (soundforge, and the DVD/BR program) work well together.

One of the things I like about Vegas is now with 10 video and AUD. TRACK I use Vegas for a mix and finish in soundforge.

It's a powerful program and perhaps hard to use if you haven't use a NLE before, but I got up and running within a week. I won't be going back to Avid Studio - great concept, poorly implemented.

I do some web video's for clients and so far Vegas has performed flawlessly.

The slide show function is very easy to use as it the pan/zoom facility. Lots of good additional content like music, title editor, and effects.

I use a CanonVixia H100 and a Nikon D7000 for video and the rendered files are amazing at 1920, 30 frames. Just ask my cat who attacked a YellowLeg shore bird from a wildlife video I&iexcl;m going. Caught him before he clawed the screen, same thing with a Blue Heron eating a fish. No flicker, no problems with the fades and a score I did with ACID loops sounded great.

The help forum on SonyCreativeSoftware are friendly and lots of knowledgeable folks ready to help you with questions. Also free email support.

If you out grow this software then Sony Vegas Pro looks like it is similar enough to make a seamless transition. I  think I should have changed software a while ago"
"I've been a regular user of AutoCad now for well over a decade (I started on R10.) I've had various versions of LT on my home computers since '95. If you work in a 2-D environment, then it is everything you really need. In fact, even though I use full AutoCad at work (R14) I regularly take drawings home with me to view and edit on my LT. I've also done extremely large projects at home (mechanical design) that are as complex as anything that I've ever done on the full version at work. However, if you are now part of the 3-D and solid modelling world, then you are out of luck. This is strictly a 2-D product.
 At the risk of offending the newer generation out there, I've found that in my experience 2-D fits the actual needs of the vast majority of users in the real manufacturing world. In fact I've seen company after company, especially small ones, that have been talked into solid modelling ( and expensive new work stations) they never needed, only to end up using the system exclusively for 2-D work. I've also seen several companies suffice perfectly well with a couple of seats of AutoCad LT on their old office PC's, combined with AutoCAD Viewer for the salesmen (which is a much, much, more economical way to go.)
 Oh yes, don't even think about loading this software on multiple machines with only a single license. Autodesk WILL come down on you like a 600 pound gorilla...."
"Easy to install, automatic updating and automatic scanning, checks everything but the family laundry. Super  Excellent Support.  If you have crashes of your PC, it is very easy to go to their web site and re-download your program and reinstall it, unassisted and no 64 digit codes to type and re-type and re-re-type.  My highest recommendations."
I have been using this for almost a month now and am very satisfied.  It installs and runs well on Windows 7.  Until this version I have in the past been critical of Quickbooks because I felt it had poor reliability.  Have had no problems with this version at all.  With Microsoft dropping further development of Microsoft Accounting and if Intuit continues improving reliability it looks like Quickbooks is the way to go.  My only complaints are that Intuit no longer offers discounts for people who are upgrading from a earlier version and that they want to charge you extra for payroll.  This results in me deducting one star from what would otherwise be an excellent product.
"Put the DVD in tray , close tray , nothing. Open my computer , double click icon , installation comes up, click installation nothing. Close installation , right click on icon , click open , go to setup file , click setup file , software installs. Try to open for first time , serial number box pops up , type in serial , states serial number invalid. Uninstall reinstall about 5 times still no luck. Right before writing this review tried one more time , still no luck. Very unimpressed with customer service. Have to jump through hoops , which I haven't done yet. Will try in the future , right now very frustrated. Will update when/if get the software to work. FYI there are no #0 or #1 they are either letter O or Letter I ."
"I loved the product when my children used it years ago. When I saw they had it available on Amazon I purchased it for my local elementary school to use with the younger students who were learning about the Caribbean. However, we were not able to install the software because the technology was not compatible with the new computer systems."
my sons father loves this item he did a lot of reviews on it and is still learning how everything works but he is very happy with it.
"so far, so good"
"The product was excellent, however it would be wonderful if it was sold with a power supply. I had to purchase a separate power supply."
I have purchased this before and love it much more than later version that you have to use several different CDs with. This is much more convenient and price is great. Thanks.
PC MAG has rated this product tops for the last three years. It is fairly straight forward - I was able to figure it out without help but it took me a while.  The tutorials could be better. Don't expect much help of any kind from the publisher. They don't take phone calls - (actually they do but they charge you) You may post a question on their web site and wait two days to get a very brief answer.  But - it is a very good product! I would give them five stars if their customer service was better.
"I have always been leery of Quickbooks.  When intuit launched the online version, I thought I would give it a try.  I've been very impressed with how easy it is to use and convenient the tools are across various devices.  I would highly recommend Quickbooks Online!"
"My third year doing my owner personal and business tax returns after the CPA got over $1,200.  It is made so easy to follow and I regret I didn't use TurboTax long ago!"
"***UPDATE 11/30/14: Changing my rating to 1 Star. I can not believe that QB charged my credit card $2.16 after I finally broke down and gave them my C/C information, because it was the only way to activate my payroll and I had Federal and State Reports that were overdue (since I was hesitant to give my credit card information to quickbooks when I didn't owe them any money).  The charge is for a payroll back in August - a full 3 mos prior to the current activation!  I still have never incurred any valid charges from Quickbooks, as my previous payroll subscription(expired 10/14) included 3 Employees at no additional charge, and my current payroll (activated 11/14) includes 1 Employee at no additional charge.  I have only had 1 employee all year long - and yet they are charging me extra!!!  Quickbooks - you are guilty of FRAUD! You force people to give you their credit card to activate a subscription that is already bought and paid for on Amazon, and then you charge them for services that are already included in the purchase.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  I WILL BE LOOKING FOR AN ALTERNATIVE TO QUICKBOOKS THIS WEEK POSSIBLY PEACHTREE.

***Previous review 11/25/14: I am giving this product a 2 star rating due to the fact that Quickbooks has stooped to a record low, in the areas of greed and unethical business practices.  After spending an hour with support (and speaking with 2 supervisors), I can verify that the new version of Enhanced payroll CAN NOT BE ACTIVATED WITHOUT ENTERING YOUR CREDIT CARD OR CHECKING ACCOUNT INFORMATION, AND AGREEING ELECTRONICALLY TO AUTOMATICALLY RENEW EACH YEAR, UPON THE EXPIRATION OF EACH YEAR'S CURRENT PAYROLL SUBSCRIPTION.  The new Payroll version only allows 1 employee at no additional cost and then charges you $2 per month for each additional user.  The software tracks your payrolls each month, so that as you add or delete employees it just bills you whatever it determines you should pay that month, per your initial Agreement.  Because I have only 1 employee on my payroll, I should not have to provide a Credit Card, because I should never be billed anything.

Additionally, I will NEVER purchase a Subscription Renewal from quickbooks because they are very overpriced compared to Amazon, where I have been buying my Payroll and QB Pro for many years - so again, they have NO VALID REASON FOR DEMANDING MY CREDIT CARD OR REFUSING TO ACTIVATE MY ALREADY BOUGHT AND PAID FOR PAYROLL SUBSCRIPTION.  The reason that they are requiring the Credit Card is so that a year from now, they can automatically renew your payroll subscription and charge your credit card ""the current price at the time of renewal"".  Customer Support reassured me repeatedly that they would immediately cancel my Auto-Renewal as soon as I provided my Credit Card and they activated my payroll account.  They also reassured me that they only were requiring a credit card in order to provide great customer service by insuring that no one would have any interruptions in their service.  Really?

Why would anyone be required to provide a credit card to activate a service that they have already paid for and will not be incurring any future costs or charges to use?  Why would any reputable company also require you to Electronically Agree to an Automatic Subscription Renewal, but tell you not to worry - they will cancel your automatic renewal as soon as you agree to it and enter your credit card or checking account information along with it?  Why would an ethical company not provide for any means for their customers to be able to activate the payroll without a credit card and agreeing to the automatic renewal, if they were not going to add additional employees and not renew automatically and not be incurring any additional charges?  An honest and ethical company would just not allow me to add any employees to payroll unless I provided satisfactory billing information.  Apparently Quickbooks does not value fairness, honesty or ethical business practices.

DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  I have been a loyal QB Pro & QB Enhanced Payroll user for too many years to count.  I have put up with the onslaught of popup ads and solicitations to upgrade to overpriced a la carte services and extras, and with the hit or miss overseas customer service for many years and still I have recommended it to many  clients and friends because it seems to be one of the better solutions for many small businesses - that is why I still gave it 2 stars, but you have stooped to an all time low in greed and, questionable business practices.  You were always on the edge, but you have finally crossed the line, from aggressive sales tactics to deception and opportunistic means.  I would highly recommend that anyone not already on Quickbooks or Enhanced payroll, finds other solutions before you get in too deep."
If you're just starting in the industry you definitely have to start with this set! Your downline will thank you!
"This is a very useful tool for my son, he finds everything here instead of trying to find it on the web."
"Since the other review for this is so horrible, I'm going to go ahead and write one even though I've only used this simulator for about 2 weeks. I'll update as I learn more.
First off let me say that I am an electrician and also a student of industrial process control. So if you are anything along those lines from apprentice to engineer than this is going to be a good purchase for you. If you are not familiar with the function of ladder logic and the associated items that work with it then this is a good way to figure it out.
This product comes with programs for both function block and ladder logic. I am not at all familiar with function block right now so I won't comment on that portion.
You will need to understand the functions of the icons before beginning and they are all in the instruction manual that is included on the CD. The instruction manual is pretty decent and it does a good job of explaining what icons are what but you will have to take the time to read it carefully so that when you get into the simulator you are not confused by all the icons and how to address them.
This is a great setup for learning the basics but if you want to get to the ""programmer"" level then I would suggest taking a PLC class along with this to learn some of the more common programs like RSlogix, Siemens and Omron.  For my purposes which is simply to learn the basics of PLC programming the simulator is an excellent choice for only 20 dollars.

If you do decide to buy this simulator and it works out for you or doesn't for that matter, please leave a real review and don't be one of those knuckleheads that only writes about how fast it got to you and the condition of the package. Were all trying to learn something here and that doesn't do any good for anyone"
Great way to have professional advice without hiring a CPA.
Downloaded with a virus!
It says in plain print that this disc is compatible with Windows Vista 64. IT IS NOT!!! It doesn't even work with Windows 7!
"The program is horrible.  It cannot recognize basic words.  I have had the program for several weeks and have been ""training"" it to my voice, which is a normal adult male voice.  I am a natural English speaker with clear diction.  However, the pogram cannot recognize basic words even when I speak slowly and clearly.  Literally every single sentence has several errors that take significant time to correct.  Here are a few examples:

""Often I've asked myself why I'm watching this movie"" becomes
""Often I've asked myself I my offspring this movie""

""Amber asked me that the other day"" becomes
""Over will as me that the other day""

It is truly pathetic.  Voice recognition technology just hasn't advanced far enough for this type of thing to be worth my time, at least with Dragon Naturally Speaking.  Hopefully other voice recognition software is better, but I've had enough.  I've spent much more time correcting sentences than it would have taken to have written the senteces on a keyboard in the first place."
"Made wills for my wife and I very quickly. Haven't looked at the Living Trust Maker yet, but I trust it must be as easy to use. Great price!"
In time for Tax season.
Product came on time and worked great!! Everything I needed to get started was included in the packaging and everything was in good condition.
"This software was purchased primarily for the Word feature.  It is meeting my needs for letter, memo and other text files.  I recently used the label feature to create an approx. 100 label file for our Christmas mailing.  It was relatively easy to enter the addresses once I became somewhat proficient at entering each line item for each label.  I don't know how to use the other segments of the software but I am retired and there is always tomorrow."
"Do not buy this for your window 7, does not work. Bought the download version at first , downloaded about 2/3 of the way then just stuck . Amazon was kind enough to refund then bought the cd version ; the same problem  occurred . Tried to contact customer service  at resume maker not helpful at all . Wasted money and a lot of headache . Wish  I can have my money back , I will never buy anything from this vendor ever again."
Quicken is the only way to go!!!!
I am in college and was taking English and needed Microsoft Word for my writing. I was using another program that didn't work for the type of writing I was doing. I had a trial size program that ran its time on my computer. I decided to buy one because many students requested Microsoft and tried it. I'm very happy that I invested in the product and it saves me time with my school work.
"I recently purchased the Scrapbook Factory Deluxe ver. 2.0 software.  So far, I believe that this is one of the best software products on the market today.  It is very user-friendly, and without much of a learning curve. You can produce impressive scrapbooking pages, in a matter of minutes.  However, the problem comes in when you create scrapbooking pages with more than 12 pictures and text on a page.  If you do not print that page as soon as you finish creating it, trying to save it and print it later, is impossible.  What happens usually, is that the page with all of your hard work will usually crash, and you end up starting all over.  This can be quite disappointing.  Secondly, even with a new printer, when you put a full page border on your page, there have been many occasions, where the border would not print correctly on the bottom of the page, and some of it would get chopped off.  Lastly, as a friendly suggestion, more templates are needed for the areas of Graduation, Kwanza, Anniversaries, Halloween and Easter.  Other than the few bugs mentioned above, ""Good Job, Nova Development""!  I'm looking forward to your next new and improved version."
WORKS GREAT.
I have used Turbo Tax since about the beginning of the millennium and have pretty much always been satisfied with it.  I am extremely surprised that Intuit would remove features from one of its most successful products and alienate its loyal customers.  I have already ordered the Deluxe Turbo Tax product.  I will probably slog through entering manually the schedules that I need that have been removed as I refuse to be forced to upgrade just to get the features that were available in the deluxe version.  Next year I will be going to H&R Block.  Really sad...
"Followed instructions. It came on but I couldn't play anything and it was very complicated. Bad instructions, horrible platform!"
"Windows 10 is ok. an upgrade from 8.1. Only buy this if the seller is amazon.com, and if you pay much less than $100 don't expect it to be legit.
The activation code is very, very small and it is under a ""scratch off"" portion on the COA label.  Don't be confused by the part that says ""this is not a coa"". That is the sticker that surrounds the COA. I need a magnifying glass (or use iphone camera and zoom) to read the letters."
I have used Parallels for over 4 years on my mac.  It allows me to use a mac for my work laptop and run my enterprise software on windows 7!
"Have used it for years.  It automatically feeds some info from year to year, allowing less data entry.  Although it's very thorough, sometimes it gets cumbersome to move around in the program, especially if you want to skip around to different sections initially instead of following the program's layout.  Would recommend it to someone who's somewhat knowledgeable about their finances and taxes but who still needs some step-by-step assistance.  Each year, the program has had improvements."
"Obviously, the tax code is confusing and TurboTax does an excellent job at simplifying requirements. In addition, TurboTax helps you get organized, i.e. Income sources, Deductions and Tax Credits.  However, the cashless sale of stock options does need work, specifically distinguishing the type of sales that can occur; and other requirements associated with the sale of equity assets."
Quicken does all of the things that I expected it to do quite well plus a few more. Record keeping and internet banking features are very good. There was a bit of a problem on the install that Quicken Tech was not able to resolve but it was only by shear accident that I was able to figure out the problem and fix it with ease.
"I just purchased the software and successfully installed it on my computer.  When I got to the point of entering dividends and capital gains, I couldn't figure out how to import the data from Fidelity that I've done for the last few years.  Looking around on the Fidelity website, I can across the following statement: ""For the 2005 tax year, Fidelity information will not be able to be imported directly into H&R Block's TaxCut programs. H&R Block expects that these products will have this functionality restored for the 2006 tax year.""  Unfortunately, this is the reason I'm using a software tax prep program, looks like it's back to TurboTax!"
"There are a number of issues:
1). CTRL-X no longer works correctly and bi-directionally between Investment accounts and source/destination account for cash transfers. It is really annoying to have to select the other account and find the other end of the transfer manually, I use this a lot to avoid mistakes.
2). One Step Update: I used to omit certain accounts from this and update them from the register ""actions"" dropdown later. I don't want to dialog with my bank account (used to pay bills) until I have downloaded all my credit cards and reconciled them. If there is a bill I expect that to be set up as a ""send"" transaction before I interact with the Bank. Now I keep finding that the Bank is downloaded prematurely (so has to be accessed again) or that the ""download"" box is checked but not the ""pay so-and-so bill"", increasing the risk of forgetting to pay a bill this weekend (so it is delayed a week, I do my finances weekly, not daily).
3) Minor nit: When I enter a price $158.75, why does it appear as ""158 3/4""? I thought that went out years ago. Fortunately it shows in the price history as $158.75 after entry, but it is not what I typed and it is a distraction."
The add-ons are incompatible with Firefox 30.0. That is a major drawback.

Purchased 4 my 6 yr old son. Loves his leapster explorer. Fun & educational :) loves it & helps make learning fun for him which is very hard to do in this world of wii & xbox & cell phone un educational games. highly recommend.
"I purchased TaxCut Premium this year.  Big mistake.  I encountered two problems with the Schedule C.  First, I found that two different business types had the same Principal Business codes.  Second, and truly egregious, is that the interview process for the Schedule C (for a sole proprietorship) neglected to ask about Cost of Goods Sold!!! For a retailer this is generally the largest expense!  The Final Review feature didn't even provide a warning that these fields were blank on the Schedule C.  It's easy enough to get around, going directly to the form, but when I contacted customer support to alert them to these problems they gave stupid answers like ""delete the form and then go through the process again.""  Huh?  Ridiculous."
Used it for many years and then tried something different that didn't do the job that I expected it to do.
"it dose not work.. Dead

are you paying for my pay role??????????????????? I paid for this fake product so shut the hell up and so I am am telling you! my email is fruad?? who the hell you  think you are??? then I hang up. I respond like this to any one that is rude to tax paying customers
 its just as bad as Norton. just as dead. oh Norton dose not kill virus. instead delete folders and files when it is not allowed to do. then windows dose not boot up.

Stopzilla faked it that kills instaltlion
Norton kills installtion
earer one dose not work"
I didn't see much difference.
"I was impressed by Microsoft's accounting program, even though it maybe be better suited for the professional or small business. But if you have a hard time controlling your check book or receipts, this is one program I would recommend.
The installment is pretty easy and and easy to use. Just a word of caution because if you want to upgrade, you may have to break out the waller. Overall, an interesting way to keep count of your finances.

"Worked fine for us. With the 2014 TY changes, this may be the last wonderful version of Turbo Tax... we'll see!"
"It's decent but alot of the time whenever I recorded with it it kept going off by itself or ""not responding"" also you have to buy the editor separately which sucks.
Maybe my computer was just not good enough to use this I dunno."
There's a lot of material on this CD. There's also just a lot of fun and good-natured silliness. A very good supplemental activity.
Great App
"After a great deal of personal effort, I was able to achieve a stable download of my transaction data from my bank, credit union and brokerage for Quicken 2016 so as to continue using it as I have done for 20+ years  (Barclays bank credit card downloads still intermittent fail). Unfortunately most of the data from the previous Quicken installation became unusable. Please tell the Quicken management (THEY DON'T SEEM TO OTHERWISE BE LISTENING) that the new Quicken 2017 version had better be stable, no bugs with downloading data from my bank & Schwab, and NOT mess up anything that I have carefully set up & tracked in Quicken 2016 - else the Quicken product and company are toast.  BEST WARNING TO ALL POTENTIAL PURCHASERS :  DON'T BUY ANY VERSION OF QUICKEN 2017 UNTIL THEY GET TO BUG FIX LEVEL ""R5"" (TYPICALLY IN MARCH OR APRIL) BECAUSE YOU ARE VERY LIKELY TO BE UNHAPPY WITH IT!  IF YOU WANT WHAT QUICKEN IS REALLY GOOD AT, GO WITH QUICKEN 2016 NOW THAT APPEARS TO STABLE AT BUG FIX LEVEL ""R8"" (actually at bug fix level 9 because they had to re-release the product a year ago without incrementing the bug fix level - it was an awful time to be a long time Quicken user).  If you use Barclays Bank for any of it's many 3rd party credit cards like Wyndham Rewards or NFL or Apple Rewards VISA, stay away from Quicken."
My husband said that I was addicted when building Notre Dame and I agree  that I was. Not only is this great fun but educational. I had not quite  completed the Platinum level when we went to England. I found myself  enjoying going through the big cathedrals there and was more curious about  them because I had built Notre Dame. I don't think I would have found the  cathedrals quite so interesting if I had not done this puzzle. I recently  just finished the platinum level but did have to go to Wrebbit site and and  get the final clue to free Esmeralda. The puzzle clues change on every  level. What you find in the first is not in the same place on the last. Now  I'm going to try Victorian Mansion.
"I love Turbo Tax, it help take a lot of guess work out."
"I've been using Norton Antivirus Suites (And Others) since I bought my first computer back in 1993,  I've always owned at least 3 PC's at any given time.  In all the annual Reviews, which I read every year, altho Norton isn't always rated the top Antivirus product it's always Rated as one of the Top 3 and altho some other programs score better in certain tests in the reviews, Norton is almost always found to be overall probably your best bet taking into account the overall scores averages..."
I've always liked and used turbo tax. Still do.
"worked fine but after a while it asked me to validate again which I am unable to and then it crashed. every time I tried to burn , Disappointing"
"For the price of 7.99, this PC game is WELL worth it, great graphics, colorful and lots to do! My four year old daughter is in love with the many tasks to complete in this game, including dressing and grooming wide variety of pets and decoration of numerous floats to show in your little one's very own parade."
"The user interface is highly cryptic. The customer support is shameful and virtually non-existent.  Never got a virus though while using it, but did get a lot of false positives using Auto-Hot-Key ... Ant watch out for the Auto renewal scam."
It's didn't help my PC still slow....
Nice item thank you
"I had great expectation from this software for my boy, but apparently the product came defective.  I tried to load it onto my two PCs, but it would not load onto either of them due to errors.  I emailed the manufacturer about the problem, but received no response after two weeks.  So, I had to send it back to Amazon."
Very nice. I just wish you could zoom in on the pictures on the PC app...you can on the Android app.
Very easy to use.
I have been Symantec product user for years and this is my third edition of Norton SystemWorks. Particuarly like the utilities aspect for troubleshooting. Support is good as well.
"If you aren't familiar with Freeverse, it's time you were. Their card games are packed full of style and wit. Complete with game variations and a great help system, iPuppet combines four of Freeverse's best games: Hearts, Spades, Euchre, and Setback/Pitch. Included is access to AspyrWorld, where you can play any of these games online against friends and strangers. Of course you can also play off-line against the game's various AI characters. If you like computer card games, iPuppet is an easy winner."
Doesn't work on current computer systems. Was a waste of money. We tried on a few different computers without any luck.
"Its ok...but don't for one minute think that Linux is LESS of a security risk. What a joke that previous reply was, considering Linux released more ""patches/fixes"" last year than Microsoft. The product itself is probably the best it has ever been, (thanks to the open source community) ;) Still compiling and configuring isn't for the noobies out there....(yet) :)"
"As always, works well, is easy, and allows for flexibility when certain circumstances require other than pre-defined workflow or entries."
I love that I am up to date and my mac use to freeze and now that i upadated it hasn't frozen ever since!!!
Very Basic and Just another number generator. It will work on XP.
"Absolutely useless.  They teach VERY few phases, most of which you would never use.  The worst part is they don't teach you what the different elements of the sentences even mean.  This is ONLY good if you want to just memorize 3 or 4 phrases and be done with it.  This is NOT good if you want to learn anything about the Japanese language.

Useless..."
"Product provides good value for the cost. Not as easy to use as desired for a person who is not very tech-competent. Installation was nerve wracking because I had no idea what was going on, and I did not know whether installation was proceeding successfully or not. Use of the program was relatively straightforward, but I did encounter some entry issues that I did not know how to resolve, so I actually went through the process 3 times until I was confident that I had gotten the entries right. Biggest negative was my inability to view or print the Qualified Dividends and Capital Gains Tax Worksheet. Since this was used to calculate the actual tax due, I think it is very important and should be accessible to me. I wanted to see the actual calculations used to arrive at the tax due, so I performed the calculations manually on a hardcopy worksheet from the Form 1040 instructions; gratifyingly, my results agreed with the software's. But I don't think I should have to do these manual calculations, and I think the software should provide the worksheet. Rated as a good value because it allows for tax calculations involving investment income, something that is only available at higher (and more costly) levels from a competitor."
Did what I expected it to do. Help is somewhat limited.
"I am using this software for 1 week and i found it really sophisticated compared to Norton System Works 2000. But during 1 week period,i experienced some problems with my computer and i highly doubted it related to that  software(i had to use my recovery disk once).I think easy uninstaller in  that package is not efficient enough. You know it has many fancy features  but not much reliable. But i only have 1 week experience and i have to keep  an eye on it for more complete review."
"It works and have not had any issues, but I don't use it a lot."
"This product is quirky. Overall does a decent job, but not polished at all. Considering a full blown accounting solution."
Dragon is really the best dictation software on the market.  Our son has dyslexia and it is much easier for him to dictate than to write by hand or type.  This software is best at capturing what he is saying and will then get used to his voice.  We tried other options and school too agreed with our assessment this is the best software out there.
"I prefer the HR Block software product and have used either DeLuxe or Premium versions for about 17 years. One year I tried TurboTax but went back to HR Block the next year.

Have completed six Federal and three State returns. Have not had any problems with it."
"Bought a new computer that came with McAfee and two additional licenses. I loaded one of the licenses on my laptop. I have been running a free anti-virus program on this machine for over two years without any problems. Within 24 hrs of loading McAfee (and deleting the other program) I had a rather serious virus.

Used another computer to research it and found that it has been around a while and directions to remove it, although it was generally suggested, due to the nature of the virus, that I have it professionally removed.
McAfee failed to stop the virus and I even did a full computer scan and McAfee failed to see that there was a virus.

Sooo, I called McAfee Customer Service (obviously in India) and the first person I talked with was border line useless, obviously reading from a script stating the same thing over and over. Insisted it was my fault for downloading it. Huh ??? I was then transferred to another department which also stated it was my fault and for $90 (the entire program cost less than one-third of that), they would access my computer remotely and remove it. Upon further complaint from me (like how could they let the virus through and also how come the scan doesn't recognize there is one there) they agreed to remove it for free but next time it would cost me. At one point they advised me that apparently the virus turned McAfee off in order to gain access to my system. Gee, thought that's what virus protection was supposed to avoid. I advised them I didn't trust them to remotely access my computer.

Not only do I find this program to be a useless waste of money but customer service is even a worse mess. I would recommend almost any other program (even the free ones) for more protection than this program appears to provide."
"Works wireless as well as wired, which I love. Connected great with Android phone after download of iMegacam but be sure to have phone close to camera during setup for quicker connect. I purchased for use as a security for my home. Would purchase again if another is needed. I love the fact I can use it with my smart phone.

"Are you used to saving program files in C:\Program Files\Name of program? Well you can forget doing that with Vista unless you buy the two most expensive versions (Ultimate or Business)? Why is that? Because Vista does not recognize you as the owner of your own C: drive unless you claim management rights to your computer -- which you can do only with Vista Ultimate or Vista Business. And if you want to be driven truly nuts by a million annoying ""protective"" filters every time you visit a web site, Vista is the operating system for you. Warning: if your current computer is old and you are thinking of getting a new one, go to an auction site and get an XP machine while you still can."
Excellent product - I had a much earlier version without so many bells and whistles.  I'm very pleased.
this thing is genius..
Useful tool!
It keeps asking me to install toolbar I have but it still asks. Tired off it asking.
Pandora Schmandora. This is the ultimate music site!
"I just installed this and it was the easiest thing ever, instantly cleaning nearly 1,000 MG of space. I'm running the Yosemite 10.11.6 operating system, and unlike another review I read, I had no problem at all. Highly recommend."
It has been running great. Thinking about upgrading.
I have been using Quicken for many years now.  I run in to a problem ever so often which I had not anticipated and I am able to figure it out.
Grandson loves this and all the games. Fun and educational at one time.
Product arrived as scheduled and as advertised. Loaded right up on the computer and is working great. Great product. A very good alternative to the windows software if you feel a need to migrate. Plenty of software to download for both business and personal use. Excellent product.
"Several years ago I purchased the online access to Rosetta Stone.  I don't know if that is still available but the months went by and I ended p paying a lot of money.  I actually don't think there is much difference between that and this....the features that I remember re all comparable.  I didn't end up using it enough.  Really, you should just pay for what you need and I believe this is what I need.  I took a year of Spanish in college and I just don't remember enough and I need to learn it now.  I can't wait to see how quickly I progress with this.  I will update.  If you are trying to decide which software to buy, I definitely recommend this.  I don't have a DVD drive on this computer, so I just downloaded it and entered the code on the sticker in the package,  It was very easy.  Great product."
got this several years ago.  Tried to use it a few times when we visited italy.  Haven't used it for awhile so I really can't say
"Webroot has been my favorite computer anti-virus software for 5 yrs, I highly recommend it for any computer. Consider and Buy!"
"To bad there's no competition. Still has the bugs from Quicken 2013 plus some new ones. When I try to download transactions sometimes it doesn't give me the proper window to enter my password. It tries without a password then gets an error. Every now and then it hangs and I have Windows terminate.  Bugs from 2013 where you enter a bill reminder into the register the entry disappears. I tried online support, but the foreigner didn't understand the problem at all, I gave up after 1/2 hour of chat with 5 minutes between each entry, and several disconnects."
"One would think that backup software named True Image would create an accurate image of your computer disk. But it doesn't. Buried three menu levels deep is a list of files that it excludes by default from even a disk image backup. Some like hiberfil.sys can generally be ignored without problem, but also included is the Chrome/User directory. So no Chrome cookies or user settings are restored. If Acronis is not actually making a true disk image, what else is it hiding from me? Also, I had to type my encryption password four times during a test restore before it was recognized. Maybe I mis-typed it the first time, but not twice after that. Having done more than a few restores from backup in the past 35 years, I have to have absolute trust in the backup software I use. Acronis falls far short of earning that trust.

To add insult to injury, half of the main menu features are attempts to sell cloud backup space and backup for phones and other devices. I want no nonsense backup software, not shill-ware. Finally, despite thousands of words in English in the interface, the main menu is a set of cryptic icons with no text. I guess that made sense to someone at Acronis. Macrium Reflect is more expensive but I'll gladly pay for solid backup software."
"I came to PC-cillin with high expectations, based on other reviews.  And like other reviewers, I'm impressed by (1) its low price, (2) the quality of its antivirus program and the frequency with which definitions are updated, (3) the fact of free tech support by phone and e-mail, and (4) the whole program's relatively low impact on computer memory and speed.

On the other hand, knowledgeable users seem concerned about the quality of its firewall - a concern corroborated by PC Mag's new review ([...]) and by the failure to cloak ports on my computer.  Moreover, the spyware filter failed to catch two suspicious files flagged by another leading program.  And the antispam filter has only about an 80% success rate in my experience.

More worrisome are the bugs.  At first PCC would hang while attempting to download updates -- a problem eventually fixed by uninstalling the program (which I had loaded from a CD) and reinstalling it from the Trend Micro website.  But two more issues have been unresolvable despite countless hours spent with various tech support people and several escalations.  First, the e-mail scanner fails to display a pop-up confirmation, leaving me less than certain that the scans are happening reliably.  Second, when I awaken my computer from stand-by, Outlook Express freezes while attempting to download messages, requiring me to restart Windows.  No need to recount the various suggestions made by the tech support people, some reasonable and some clearly silly.  All have failed.  (At one point, the T.M. level-2 techie had me scan for spyware with another company's program -- a tacit admission of PCC's inadequacy.)

I very much wanted (and expected) to like PC-cillin, but it has cost me an enormous amount of time and still doesn't work properly.  Even if I persevere and these issues are solved at some point, I'll probably disable the firewall and spyware features just as I've already gone back to another antispam program."
When I first heard the name I wasn't sure I wanted to purchase so I downloaded the demo version which was highly recommended by one of my computer Guru's. Easy to install and easy to use! It's like having an anti-virus program and not knowing it. I then ordered it from Amazon. It doesn't get in the way of my normal operations. Great product! FYI... I now go to Amazon first when looking for anything.
I liked the older versions better.
"Firstly I have to admit I do not like Garmin products. They have fallen way behind Google maps. The user interface is horrible. But, if you do not have cell access you cannot use google maps navigation. So I am going to Italy and thought I would get these maps for my Nuvi as a back-up.

I loaded the SD and can go to Florence and see the street details, but when I search for Florence, it says not found! I then zoom in to the Villa we are staying at and I find the road to the villa is not on the map! There is no way to update, so I am stuck with an out of date map."
Forced to buy this new version because my bank wouldn't support the older version. Ok so far.
"Vendor sells Pirated licenses.
The box was siled but the lisence has been activated multipal times.
Unfortunately I was not able to discover the problem after it was too late to ask for return.
KIS2012 is a good  product if you have a valid license.
*** BAD dial ***"
It's great software for making video's. Not easy to use at first but after watching tutorials and how to's on YouTube. I can say it is pretty impressive for the price.
The only problem is that sometimes I need to disconnect it and connect it again to hear the audio
Worked great was so glad I had it
Included with my prime membership. The quality is right up there with Play Music and Groove.
"Typical QB expensive POS I buy it download it install it it registers then when trying to install payroll it says invalid product key? REALLY? It accepted it to install the stupid SW. I have always hated this product their support sucks but I have not choice, like Obamacare I'm forced to use it.
Do your self a favor and use a calculator and spread sheet"
This is the best Quicken yet for easy downloads and manage ability. Everyone should use it and learn from it.
Well this pgrade is really great if you have upgraded to FCE 3.5 already. However if you are upgrading from an older version watch out. FCE 4 comes with only 500mb of live type content. FCE 3.5 came with 10GB. If livetype isn't a priority for your video production then go for it. But if you are looking for an upgrade for your FCE from 3 or lower and your live type 1 and want all the latest live type content this upgrade is not for you. Buy the livetype 3.5 or buy both 4 & 3.5 while you can.
Love it
Barf. And double barf on having to create a ms account to activate this crap.
"I like the old format better, this doesn't allow the same access/viewing to my playlist when playing."
I liked the easy-to-use installation. There was nothing that I complain about.
"Needs a 16-bit OS.  I had hoped to be able to convert some old Lucid spreadsheets to Excel using this as a bridge, but did not have a computer with a 16-bit OS"
"My daughter is in first grade, so I almost made the mistake of buying the first grade one, but after reading many reviews it seemed like the first and second grade games would be too simple for my daughter because reviewers were saying it was not challenging enough. This is an excellent learning game just be sure to look at the subjects being taught to match what you're child can handle!"
"It's important to note that often there are multiple English equivalents for a Greek spelling, but with some patience this card provided us excellent, detailed coverage."
A good Purchase. I am pleased.
"My six year old son loves this game.  It does need to be run on an older PC though.  I tried it on my laptop running Windows 7 and loaded it in Compatibility Mode for Windows XP and set the screen for 256 colors but I cannot see the control menus.  I can run the game itself okay but the controls for the radio, exit buttons, etc. are fuzzy.  If you just click around to figure out what they do, some buttons work and some don't.  I put it on my older Pent II machine running Windows XP with a graphics accelerator card and it works just fine.  I can see everything well.  Maybe this is the problem another reviewer had when he said he couldn't see an exit button.  The only complaint my son has is there's no backhoe.  The equipment you use are dump truck, excavator, bulldozer, front end wheel loader, and a wrecking ball crane.  Some have attachments too like a hook for the crane.  The wheel loader has a forklift attachment.  The excavator gets an auger and a jackhammer.  You can switch stations on the radio (very cool) and get 360 views outside plus inside cab views.  You can do the missions or just drive around crashing into things.  Some of the buildings cannot be demolished.  I like the fact that the foreman is friendly and encouraging in the training mode.  A good game for kids.  So, set up your old PC with this game and you'll be left to use your new computer in peace!"
Great I use it all the time
"great app, installed all my drivers immediately and my PC is really working far better now"
"They're pretty much the best and they don't 'nickel and dime' you with ""extras"" that cost you."
"Quite simply, I had a lot of paper to scan, and I wanted a tool that would allow me some real ""professional"" options.  I originally started with Paperport and Omnipage, but the app would just not work.  I tried multiple PC's and every time, the batch processing stalled and failed.  It was a complete nightmare, and their support was pretty much worthless.

I then started trying as many apps as I could to see what could fill the need, and I stumbled on FileCenter Pro.  Wow.

Extremely easy to use, it's relatively small in size, and it's fast!  Also, it uses your standard filesystem to store files, so if you ever wanted to access them through another means, that option is available to you (I store all my docs on a network share from my Linux server).

The search is good, setting up separator pages is easy and they work well, and overall it's a joy to use.

I originally bough version 7 off of Amazon about a month and a half ago, and when I updated to version 8, the company was extremely helpful in sending me an updated product key as I was still in their upgrade window per their policy.

There are a couple things I would like to see in future products - such as an ""Auto file"" based on keyword, and the ability to move files around from the search window, but that does not detract from my 5 star rating.  Keep up the great work!"
Good Product but it only is good for one year.
Great product
"I love it. One star was taken away because of its restricted market availability - everyone who so desires, should have a Kindle Reader irrespective of where the person lives on the surface of the earth. Today it is not so and that disappoints - there are perfectly free books on the Kindle platform: it is only if free is not free that restricted access on the basis of geography make sense."
"My previous virus protection left me with a massive memory leak, slowing my laptop and using my data allotment from my provider. Since installing PC Matic, the leak has stopped, speed has increased, I do online business with confidence."
I bought this product for hikes and to guide me in navigating rivers. Only very major roads are named so I can't use this very easily to calculate my route there. Most roads are there but they just vanish at some points and reappear in others. Using a real topo map it is immediately obvious that these same roads do not dissapear and in fact continue on their course uninteruppted like a road should. The elevations and detail are very course. No trails are shown. I am not very happy I bought this product and am going to look into the roads and recreation to see if it does a better job. FYI I bought this to use with my Etrex Legend which I think is just great.
Quickbooks is a great tool to manage your business successfully.  As a construction company we were able to maximize our sells by keeping a close eye on the business.
"I have used this for 3 months now and it is pretty useful if you have to work with PDF. I had some trouble activating the product, but the support was OK. $99 is a good price."
"THE PRICE THAT I GOT, IS JUST AMAZING. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SELLING ALL THESE MICROSOFT SOFTWARE WITH A REALLY LOW PRICE. I LOVE IT."
"I just got the brand spanking new downloader virus. I am somebody who will work to get rid of a virus or trojon on my own. I couldn't get rid of this one. I called for technical help. Yes, it cost me money to repair but it was better than hauling it in to a shop. The person repaired it remotely while I watched and took a copy of the virus for the technicians to analyze. They could then send updates to protect the other Norton customers. The bugs get through. Especially when they are new. I'm just glad Norton was there to fix it."
"As already indicated in most customer review on amazon and costco, this product isn't worth the price of an ""upgrade"", but it makes it tough if you rely on it for importing from bank and other financial websites which require an upgrade every three years. Intuit currently appears to have a market monopoly for this type of application. They also don't provide an ""Upgrade"" price so we have to wait until we find a price more fitting for an upgrade. One reduction is noted on the Costco website for a limited time between 1/6/11 - 1/30/11 for the Quicken and TurboTax products. For Quicken Premier 2011, the price is currently $39.99 w/S&H of $2.99 plus taxes. Amazon's ""tell us about a lower price"" function trucates and ""errors"" a somewhat long URL so they don't accept feedback in the case of these Intuit products on costco's website."
"Before this product, I used Norton Internet Security 2005.  It was  a big resource hog.  Now that I installed PC-Cillin, my computer is only running 33 processes in the background (vs. 40 with Norton).

Also, when I went to register, the program told me my key was already registered.  I called them up and the phone was promptly answered.  After a few minutes for the verification that I actually just purchased the product, they gave me a new Product key and I was on my way.

As for the program itself, virus scanning is quick and updates come almost every day.  The only thing is that the firewall is a little different from Norton's, so you  have to configure certain ports to allow certain programs to connect through them (but this isn't too difficult).

All in all, this is a great product."
Quicken is always the best. Price was right and the download was easy I just have to make a hard copy for reinstall just in case...
Great
"I am a college student. I taught myself to type when I was eight or nine, but I don't ""touch type."" I only use a couple of fingers and my speed stalled around 45 wpm. I decided to buckle down this summer and learn to type more efficiently. My ultimate goal is 100 wpm.

That said, this is fantastic software. It is really difficult to start over from 0 wpm when you can already type, but this program is a lot of fun - I actually look forward to my practice each night. The lessons progress very slowly, which is actually a bonus because the software is very thorough. With lessons, tests, dictation, and games with multiple skill levels and options, this software never gets old. If there is one thing I would add, it would be an option for long term and short term goals. My short term goals are usually 30-50 wpm, but I'd like to see my progress toward a long term goal."
great buy if you like card games.
"Until QuickBooks, I thought I had a handle on my business finances.... well I was mistaken!!  QuickBooks is so easy to use and keeps everything organized for you!!!  Greatest invention since sliced bread!"
"I have to say that I'm very happy with this new OS. Takes less room from your HD, uses less memory and performs better than the previous Leopard. I recently enrolled on an Objective C Programming fall term class and needed to install the latest versions of Xcode and SDK, they require Snow Leopard and I was a little hesitant at the beginning, but after installing and performing a few tests on my MacBook Pro, I could easily tell that it was the right choice. The new Quicktime optimizes everything having to do with media display. The system runs smooth and I would say faster. Besides getting a new OS for only $29 makes it even more attractive. Good job Apple!"
"I have had Quickbooks for many years and have used its enhanced payroll as well.  I have been paying their annual subscription each year assuming they would give you a reasonable charge.  I found out that they have raised their prices and are now at $295.00/year.  However, purchasing the enhanced payroll on line results in a cost of about 147.00, or nearly 50% off their renewal.  I called them and asked them to match what their retailers offer.  They said they cannot price match their retailers and can only offer up to a 20% discount the subscription.  So I declined my annual subscription.

This QB 2012 + Enhanced payroll is an even better deal.  The QB 2012 Pro is $139 on Amazon and this makes the Enhance payroll $108, or 63% off their annual subscription.

I normally would give Intuit 3-4 stars for the software since it does what its supposed to, but has advertising baked into the product which is horrendously annoying.  Paid products should not have advertising, or at least have the option to disable it.

Intuit gets 1 star because their annual subscription is sneaky and fleeces customers who do not do their homework.  This goes for me... I hav ebeen fleeced many years and just woke up to this scam. Caveat emptor.

My recommendation to all buyers is to not give Intuit a real credit card number for their account so they are unable to auto-renew you.  They will send you emails of a pending renewal.  Purchase the renewal from Amazon for 50-63% discount and call up Inuit to reactive for another year."
"I've been using Safe Eyes with my son's computer for the past couple of years. In general, it's worked fairly well, however there are issues with how it works with iTunes. I tried a few times to open a support ticket with McAfee, but had only bad experiences - no record of my ticket #, no call backs, useless response.

That said, if you're not going to allow any iTunes use at all it probably will meet your needs for filtering, time limits, time of day limits, site blocking, etc. Once you get into any complex, you're pretty much on your own.

It should be said that the fault lies with McAfee. Prior to Internet Safety being purchased, I remember having a very good experience with their technical support team."
"Nero 11 is faster and more easy to do the things than the previous version. The interface didn't change; only some screens!

e system disk made it easy to download windows 7 into my windows xp computer.. The only problem was the small key code that was very hard to read .
"You'll be using this word a lot!! This brand new version lost me more time than it helped me gain. It also LOST me key important emails due to the ""key words"".There are key words which cause the software to go to another place and generally cause your email to be lost. If you have time to take a course on using this software or have a  computer mind it may work for you,if you don't then please save your money and learn to TYPE.In my opinion for the avaerage person this software is frustrating and almost never works right. The correction tips simply DO NOT WORK.I tried every one of them  and still got the same results. There is NO HELPLINE and NO PLACE FOR REVIEWS on their site. So if you like curse words,losing money or general frustration then please be my guest,BUY ONE!."
"I LOVE TREND MICRO BEEN USING IT FOR MANY YEARS. I WAS VERY SURPRIZED WHEN IT FINALLY SHOWED UP IT WAS NOT MAXIMUM SECURITY.  AFTER A LITTLE RESARCH I DECIDED TO KEEP IT RATHER THAN RETURN IT. IT SEEMS FOR HALF THE PRICE I GOT 90% OF WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. AFTER A MONTH IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING JUST GREAT. I GUESS IF YOU HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS AND HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM, YOU DON'T REALLY NEED ALL THE BELLS AND WHISTLES. IDID NOT KNOW THEY WERE STILL MAKING THE STANDARD VERSION. TITANIUM INTERNET SECURITY WORKS JUST AS WELL AS TITANIUM MAXIMUM SECURITY THANK YOU."
"wasn't able to download this on my mac , waist of $175.00 and no one is able to help me at amazon, they gave me a contact for rosetta stone of 888-767-3882 but was a number for selling me a device in case i fall down in my home, horrible experience and will try to get my money back."
I do like this product. My complaints are that if you are trying to digitize from the start you have to outline your design. It is very hard to go around corners smoothly. If it would pick up the sample and make the outlines to start. It would be much easier. Also while using this product it would stop working and shut down. Saving my work often does help with that.
"Not that thrilled by it, after using Turbo Tax for over 14 years, there were significant adjustment I had to make."

"Avoid this product as your backup app.  It can sometimes be acquired for free but is not worth it even at that price.  Caused me lots of grief in use.  If you check out your ""Users"" folder under Windows you'll see that this backup app creates it's own hidden ""user"" on your PC.  You'll see a folder called something like ""_ashampoo_"" as a type of hidden user with all types of stuff in it.  In addition to this, the backup app doesn't show up in the typical uninstaller app listings, either.  The only way to get rid of it is to run the special uninstaller app that Ashampoo provides (you'll find it in the same folder as the backup application).  And guess what?  Their uninstaller doesn't get rid of the hidden user account that Ashampoo Backup created when you installed it.  Lovely, huh?

No thanks.  Avoid this one.  You'll thank me.  Just use the native Windows backup & restore capabilities in the control panel and you'll be fine."
Better than nothing.
I previously owned Printmaster version 17.  This is just like that one.  I installed Printmaster 18.1 on my 8.1 computer and it works great.  The only problem is you need a cd adapter as my computer did not come with one in it.  I attached the cd adapter to my computer to download the program and you need it when using the program to access all the graphics and such. But I am highly satisfied.
"Wow, package arrived on Sunday!  Extremely fast shipping! Box was just as advertised and disk worked perfectly."

"I've owned many Norton products in my time, and for the most part, I've been pleased with their performance. This is also the case with NIS 2004. I've seen many reviews praising 2003 and cursing 2004. I upgraded from NIS 2003, and the change in performance has not been noticeable. On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade. It works better and has more useful features than NIS 2003.
PROS:
* Norton AntiVirus - Very pleased with this. Has a very nifty new feature (since 2003), where a small box pops up near your traybar saying that an application is waiting for a scan of a specific file. NAV has also added new signatures and logic for finding spyware in this version. As usual, it will find Viruses, Trojans and other nastiness on your computer, in your email and in your chat sessions.
* Firewall and intrusion detection - Has worked fine for me in both NIS 2003/2004. This features has been nicely improved on in NIS 2004. The main new features I like is the fact that when a program first tries to access the internet, you can temporarily or permanently choose whether to permit or block ALL traffic for this application, or have the system automatically configure settings if it recognizes the application.
* Norton Privacy Control - Can prevent you from inadvertently disclosing personal information in email/chat etc. All confidential information needs to be input manually though.
* Nicely integrates with your system, and does not needlessly interfere with applications. I've had no known application issues due to the installation of NIS 2003/2004.
* Norton AntiSpam - New features in NIS 2004. It integrates nicely with Outlook 2003 and Outlook Express. It's been quite a useful feature, and would be worth the upgrade/purchase for many users. Seems to remove about 70-80% of my spam, and seems to flag about 10-20% of my legitimate email as spam. Very user-friendly feature, and learns from your input on what's spam and not spam.
* LiveUpdate - Works great and can be configured to seamlessly update your computer against the latest threats. Works fine with modem as well - does not try to dial up all the time, but rather checks for updates when you're already online.
CONS:
* PRODUCT ACTIVATION - Almost made me not upgrade. TWO THUMBS DOWN! Personally, I don't care if the product activation is flawless, I'm very unhappy with Norton treating their legitimate customers with such great distrust.
* Needs more tweaking than I'd like to get up and running - at least for the firewall/intrusion detection bit.
* Memory/CPU and resource hog - It does slow down your system noticeably, but I'd rather have that happen than having my computer screwed up by a virus/Trojan/hacker.
PROBLEMS?
* One thing I've noticed is that a few occasions it has alerted about an intrusion attempt from my own computer. This hasn't seemed to cause any problems though.
* The automatic program scan, which is supposed to find all known software and configure the firewall/intrusion detection for each of them crashed during installation. I've not been able to successfully run this, so therefore I've had to configure each program manually as they tried to access the internet.
Overall, I'm quite pleased with NIS 2004. For me it was also worth the upgrade from NIS 2003. They could definitely improve on the performance itself, and they should remove product activation (aka. ""We hate our legitimate users, so we'll make life difficult for them""). 4 STARS!!!"
"Goodbye TurboTax!! I had used TurboTax for the past 16 years, and I was mostly happy with it. This year I saw all of the negative reviews about what Intuit did to its customers, so I took a chance on H&R Block. The product is less expensive, the interface works just as well, the soft sell is much more tolerable than Intuit, and it just plain works. I had to redo an entire TurboTax return last year because a form changed after I started my return and TurboTax does not allow you to modify forms directly. Not so with H&R Block. I was able to go in and modify form after an import on a 1099-DIV didn't work right. I encourage anyone who is fed up with Intuit (I am done with Quicken as well) to look at H&R block."
As hard as it to believe I learned to type (amazing) I'm fairly old & I didn't care for it in school. I'm now typing with pride.
Item arrived on time and was as advertised.
"This app works perfectly on my android cell phone. Books can be easily downloaded, read and page-marked whenever I please. I am more than satisfied with this app."
"After trying to import a GEDCOM file to my family tree, the program failed to function properly. If I clicked on anything (""New"" ""Open"" ""Import""), the program shut down. I uninstalled and re-installed it. Still no luck. Contacted Individual Software's tech support by email yesterday (9/17/14)about the problem. Received an email this morning from them walking me through the steps to fix it. Steps were easy to follow and they got the program working again. VERY PLEASED."
"Year after year Norton wins the software security smack down done by MaximumPC magazine. Always at the top of the list, sometimes sharing the title. Do not listen to the kids at the BBrick and mortar stores. Every year this mag  puts all the security software in a battle royal, and Norton wins. Check for yourself, never had any problems with Symantec for 12 years now."
Just can't beat how awesome this program is for doing Schedule C and E forms.  Really allows one to enter in a fool proof way and love the audit meter!  Tells you when you are in the green or red!
"I used Nero at work and needed it at home to create a DVD from an ISO image that I had downloaded on my Windows Vista System for my Linux box.  After getting past the learning curve, the product did what I wanted and is great.  I like it better than Roxio Easy CD."
Very convenient to download. The only thing is to keep the computer or labtop system in English.
Good software. Used H&R Block for years.
"Norton has evolved to be one of the better AV products. It is fairly efficient and no longer the resource hog of old. Installation is quick and it appears that uninstall nightmares are a thing of the past. Most reviews show that it is always near the top in actual virus protection.

However, it is absolutely horrible at Malware and does not seem to catch ANY of it. What a shame!  You will still need to run Malwarebytes and/or Spybot if you want to fully protect your system.

Decent rebates on NIS are now few and far between. It will be hard to stay with Norton when so many comparable products continually run ""Free After Rebate"" offers."
"Backyard baseball teams up with Major League Baseball and The  Major League Baseball Players Association to bring real-life  baseball pros to the neighborhood baseball diamond...as kids!  They have players from Mark McGwire to A-Rod,Ivan  Rodriguez,Randy Johnson,Larry Walker,Chipper Jones,Barry Bonds,  Sammy Sosa,Ken Griffey Jr.,and much,much more! As well as all major league teams. And you can play people on the internet. Theres game modes like season,single game,and batting practice. Plus you not only get the game but you get baseball cards with the game and its a whole lot of fun for anyone. Enjoy!"
Is good
"Had numerous business PCs with latest Kaspersky running.  Got a pretty nasty virus which quickly made one of the systems unusable.  Kaspersky not only didn't stop or slow the virus, it couldn't even find it on the machine.  Turns out the virus is not some new variant either, as another product which has been around a while quickly trapped and removed the offending code.  I understand there is no AV program that can trap everything, but it's frustrating when the response from Kaspersky's support seems to indicate they aren't interested in understanding why their product didn't see or trap this virus when other much simpler/cheaper products did.  YMMV, but you may want to think twice about relying on this for any serious systems you rely on."
"This was exactly what I was expecting. It is simple and has some limitations on the design side, but is very useful and helps me avoid the online version with its monthly fees.  I'd buy it again, knowing what I now know."
Good price and what I needed to upgrade to current version.
As usual the software download very easy and installed no problem. Everything was transferred from last year and all went smooth.
"Perhaps the most non-functional software I have ever purchased. While it's voice recognition seems to work just fine the command interface does not work at all. Biggest failure is the ""Press Key"" command. ""Press Enter"" for example just puts those words in as text and the enter key is never pressed. Each time the software is used it seems to lose more functionality. Things that sometimes worked when first installed now do not work at all. This is a product that should be avoided unless you like to just throw money away. If you feel a need to do just that, go ahead and buy ""NaturallySpeaking 8 Preferred"" but do not install it. You have been warned."
i was just looking for a program to get my bluray drive to work and did not want to spend a lot of money.  this program did that and has worked great  have not had any problems with it at all.  great value.
"While it was a little difficult to install, McAfee specialists were readily available by phone amd we got it installed and working."
"easy to use and install
office keeps getting better and better

but if you don't like change it may not be for you - because they changed it again ie it's 2013 and not 2010 or 2007 or 2003 or 2000 - get the idea they change the product when they change the version ;)"
Checksoft does what it promises to do.  I've purchased the product before but had to get another DVD - as such I'm setting it up from start again on a different PC.  I've reordered it this time because I liked it so well the last time.
Excellent blu-ray player!
"First the rant:  My not-very-old laptop developed several problems simultaneously, and I decided to just buy a new one, assuming I could move my Office Pro 2010 to the new machine.  Unfortunately, Microsoft said ""no""!  Turns out it was licensed for only one computer and they did not care if your computer crashed the next day after you bought it.  Your bad luck.  I see that they have backed down on that - the description for the new software says you may move it from one computer to another.

I made do with the Word and Excel starter on the new laptop, but Publisher is my go-to software, and it really galled me to have to buy it.  I even looked for other software to replace it but couldn't find anything that would convert my old files.

So, now for the review:  It took about 1.5 hours to download (I have a fairly slow connection) and only a few minutes to install.  It looks quite different from 2010, but so far using it has been fairly intuitive.  There are some changes in how it operates, but I like the ones that I have encountered.  For the most part the changes I have seen correct awkward steps.  For example, when you click in a text box there is a new menu Text Box Tools menu that you can access with many of the functions that used to be hidden several levels down in various menus.

In all fairness, I have not yet done any graphics-heavy publications.  If I encounter problems as described by some of the reviewers I will amend this review.

So, I like the software.  Still not too crazy about Microsoft."
"The customer service for Quickbooks is FANTASTIC!!!! Beyond comparison to any other payroll services. All the agents are knowledgeable, local, and really do help.

The Software is perfect for Dummies like me. The software makes it easy and allows for correction . The only service and software I would ever use or ever recommend. , hands down.

"I have used QuickBooks for about 20 years, and it works quite well for my small business. Unfortunately, they only allow you to download transactions from bank and credit card accounts for three years, forcing me to purchase the latest edition. Although they make improvements every year, very few of them are of any interest to me, and if it weren't for the download restrictions, I would probably buy a new version every 10 years, instead of three.

It's important to be aware of the learning curve associated with this product. I have a background in accounting and I've informally helped many people get started. It takes quite a few hours for a new user with no financial or accounting background to get comfortable with all the functions in the program they need to perform. This usually entails a significant cleanup operation after a couple of months of entering transactions incorrectly. Once the learning process is complete, however, QuickBooks vastly simplifies the process of running a small business."
I have used this product for that last few years and have been very pleased with it.  I use it to test software and os versions and have had no issues with configuration or deployment.  Very happy with this purchase.
"It has truly been a pleasure, a great learning experience, and a lot of fun working with Brenda.

Not only is she really good at what she does, hard working, always helping others, and a great person to work with but Brenda is overall just a really nice person, thoughtful, and you couldn't ask for a better teammate/coworker.

Her jazz hands, quirky sound effects, dance moves, appetite for tasty beverages, and bubbly personality will be missed.

Best of luck Brenda, I have no doubt you're going to do really well in your new role and your new team will love you.  You'll be missed and will never be replaced.

I got this for my son who is writing a book and wanted to add in Russian dialog through out the book. Well I was a little suspicious due to the low price but he loves it. He said it will work from within MS Word so he can translate as he writes. Well worth the price.
"Having a Mac can sometimes be a challenge, definitely worth the it, but a challenge nonetheless.  I was so glad I could use this program on my Mac, I don't know what I would do without a computer with the Office suite on it."
"Item: Cyberlink PowerDVD 14 Ultra, Rating 4.5 stars.
I really enjoy this software for playing files. I've used older versions without problems. I've also used WinDVD versions as well, and like that program too. I use more of Cyberlink's other programs like Power2Go and Director.

Install process: The install is straightforward and only took 5 minutes. After install, enter the product key, then you need an internet connection for the product activation which took 3 seconds.  First, on the Welcome Screen, click on Media Library Preference. In the Movie Library, delete or add folders you want to connect with PowerDVD. It will sync those
folders with the software. Do that for Movies, the Videos/Photos tab, and Music tab.

Next screen is the Cyberlink Cloud Service. Redeem you free one year now or later. You can upload your content from your smartphone to the cloud to be accessed later on by your other devices.

After setup was complete, I ran the updates, and that was a fairly quick process. Interface: It's a very clean and organized interface. You can drag files into the player and it will begin playing them. It's a fast program and processes everything quickly. I'm running a AMD Quad-Core processor 64-bit, with 8GB RAM, and a 1GB ATI video card. You can also create playlists of various files. I noticed that the software had automatically associated certain files with the software. While I prefer using other programs. You can change the program back by right-clicking a file and selecting ""Choose default program"" and then select the program and make sure ""Always use this as default program"" is checked. There are instructions online to change programs associated with files. This should never have been done. I'm subtracting 1/2 a star for it. But since I'm experienced with this stuff it doesn't bother me much. Others may be annoyed.

In creating PowerDVD 14 Ultra, Cyberlink knew they had to bring a much morepromising experience to PC users.  This whole package was created to be a seamless and easy to share experience.  You can easily share to Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, or Vimeo. For those who like using Vimeo forvideo-sharing, Vimeo support has also been added in this version.  I own version 11 as well, and had no issues with that version. Version 14 proves to run without problems for me. They've added support for
the new HEVC/H.265 format with this version.

Using a blu-ray optical drive, this software plays DVDs, Blu-rays, 3D Blu-rays and4K Blu-rays.  The software can also view 3D photos and videos.  BD Live is alsosupported. I tried all the types of optical discs mentioned above, and they all
played without any problem. I had to use a different computer and TV to try out the 4k discs. 4K, 3D, and 60fps discs and files require much more processing power and I had to use a 2GB video card and a much better processor.  Everthing ran smoothly.
You can also play AVCHD, MP4, MKV, and M2TS files. A tried all different files mentioned above and they all played properly.

The Ultra version includes PowerDVD Remote v2, and Power Media Player (for Android/iOS and also Windows). PowerDVD Remote requires you to install an app on or iOS or Android device, and then you can use that as a remote control, or a
wireless mouse pad and keyboard for PowerDVD.  The app works well for me on my iPhone.

CLOUD: Included with the software is a free one-year subscription of 10GB to Cyberlink's Cloud service. Price after is $10 per every 10GB of storage. You can upload your files to their cloud service and access them anywhere. The cloud
service works fast on a fast connection, but remember it depends on how fast your connection is.

Normally, I use my big-screen LCD TV, PS3 blu-ray payer, and 7.1 speaker setup for my optical disc movie-watching needs. Since I can connect my PCs to my medium-size monitor or my big-screen TV, I'm available to view all my other files that aren't on optical discs.

INCLUDED: Also included are trial versions of other Cyberlink products: PhotoDirector 5, PowerDirector 12, DirectorSuite 2, Power2Go 9, YouCam 6, and MediaEspresso 6.7. Some of them I've used before and they are really good."
"I'm not sure why NAVTEQ hates Garmin users. In other devices NAVTEQ has more recent maps and details. Just check it against google map. Both maps are provided by NAVTEQ, you should think if they have it in google map they should have it in other NAVTEQ products as well. You can definetly skip this update, if you live in Upstate SC."
love them.
"Terrible, clunky software. Have never been a big fan of its user interface. This years version takes the cake and I am not going to use it ever again! I use it for business and personal. The personal side is okay. The business side is the problem. There was no interview available for California, that means that the software is useless as it instructs you to open the whole form and fill it out without any assistance. So not only do you have to know the form and schedules that you need, you then have to know what lines to fill out. I had to use last years return and go line by line to figure out what I needed to do. Without the interview there is no purpose to the software. When I called customer support they apologized, said they had a memo about no interview for some states, offered no solution and no explanation. When asked what good is the software without the interview/guidance from H&R block he had no answer. If they had said on the box that state was not supported I would never have bought it. Can't believe they even are selling this software in this state, shameful really and bad business."
"Insanely buggy, buy you're stuck with it"
"I am a 9 year user of TurboTax for Business.  The last few years corrected a number of older problems with multi owner LLC K-1 preparation and got rid of the need to do several manual overrides.

Thank you for posting the release early again this year so I can purchase, install it, and get a preliminary year-end run in as the IRS releases forms for 2013.  This saves me time as we make some year end decisions.
I will update this review if I see any functionality issues once the final tax forms for 2013 are released."
Install & update is a nightmare which still precludes me from using the app.  The system's green progress bar comes to a dead stop before the update is installed.  I HATE IT!!!!
"Great basic photo editing. I've had no major problems with it - I use it to prep photos to upload to websites. Sometimes  I like to play with the photo effects, but really, my purposes are pretty basic, and Paintshop meets my needs."
"Ordered this last week and received it today.  My laptop was running Vista. I backed up my files and did a a clean install with no issues.

My ordered came with a 32 bit and 64 bit disk. Along with a card with the activation key.

So for no complaints. My laptop runs smoother and faster. Cool thing is I didn't want to install Windows 10 right now so it let me download the upgrade without installing it."
"This program may be powerful, it may be able to do a lot of things but the only people that I know of that know how to use the program are the people who wrote the program and they aren't making it easy on you to figure out how to use it.  I bought this program to scan business cards into Outlook.  I was told that it was easy to do and the salesman actually recommended this product over another product.

The guide has only sales pitch level bullet points for explanations. The guide tells you what it does but not how to do it. There are no tutorials that I could find on the program, on the disk or online.

CUSTOMER SERVICE IS PRACTICALLY NON EXISTANT!  The email system says it will respond in 48 HOURS. The phone line customer service is open only MONDAY thru FRIDAY during business hours.  So if you are like me and are spending your weekend trying to improve your business and hit a snag like I have, like me, you will be out of luck.

When I installed this program I went through the scanning wizard and all seemed to go well then when I actually tried to scan a document, the computer stated that another program has control of the scanner and I should shut down the other program.  Well as far as I can tell I only  had  one program running and that was OP 17.

Unless you know someone who knows how to run this program I recommend not getting it.

Unless I can get this issue resolved in a timely manner on Monday I will return this product and get my money back.  If they refuse I will cancel the payment as this product very clearly says that it is guaranteed to be compatible will all makes of scanners.  Clearly this program is not.

It so far has been a colossal waste of my time and money."
FOR  GODS SAKE DON'T BY IT FOR DOWN LOAD YOU WILL BE SCREWED BLUED AND TATOOTED
"Corel has improved their Office Suite with this new version X4.  It no longer has the problems it once struggled with using VISTA operating system.  It is easy and intuitive to work with and you can save files in MS Word for Windows format, or any other MS Office format.  It comes with WordPerfect X4, Quatro X4 spreadsheet, Presentation X4, and Lightening X4 (kind of like Office OneNote, only easier.)  At less than half the cost of MS how can you go wrong?"
super anti virus protection best out their
Great!
Program was easy to install. I have an anti-malware program but many privacy and internet issues were found and repaired. My computer is working much better.
I love it
"I think exploring the Titanic on the computer is a lot of fun. The graphics are excellent, and you do sort of feel like you are really there. Some of the rooms are very exquisitely decorated, and it's neat to walk out on the deck.
I think the game is okay, as adventure games go. Pro: The story is pretty good. It progresses at a pretty good pace. Cons: The navigation is a bit difficult in some rooms. Also, this is one of those games where you spend a lot of time interacting with characters, and choosing from a list of responses. Like many adventure games with video, some of the acting is not stellar.
I think this game is worth buying if you like to explore, and are intrigued by the Titanic story."
"I've had to reformat my computer several times and each time I either get Norton Go Back to work, or the other diagnostics, but not both at the same time. A technician tried to help me online, but was unable. He told me someone would contact me the next day to resolve. That was months ago. It is still unresolved.
Norton does not seem to care about ensuring that its products work properly and this is one of the reasons I may be switching to a Mac for my next computer."
"It is nothing like my regular office program on my other computers. I sent it back, but that is no problem with Amazon! I love my amazon prime! They are so good to take things back for whatever reason you don't like it!"
Didn't even come with the disc to download it.
Well so far
My hard drive failed and needed replacing in my Windows 7 laptop.  This restore disk and drivers worked perfectly with my Windows Key (which was on the bottom of my laptop). Replacing the failed hard drive and buying this recovery disk (since I was an idiot and never made any) was way cheaper than buying a new machine.  Cheers and thank you!
"I WAS a loyal customer right up until I encountered a problem.  The problem almost wiped my computer clean, I was able to save some of my pictures and documents but contacting ESET was almost impossible.  I was given a telephone number which was nice except NOBODY ANSWERED !  Let me repeat that, ""NOBODY ANSWERED"", not exactly sure what to call that kind of customer service, certainly not support.....

The one and only time I needed help they didn't help me.

I sent several e-mails but to no avail.  Guess they don't want their ""loyal customers"" anymore."
"The only complaint's I have is that I had a bit of a problem converting my quicken data into quickbooks. I was back and forth with quicken and quickbooks customer service because one doesn't know or help with the other.
The other thing would be the possiblity of being able to recieve (record)payments right at the time your typing up the invoice rather then going to a seperate window.
 I wish they would combine the best of quicken and quickbooks!
Quickbooks is defintely better for my business."
"This is by far the most useless, overprice piece of junk I have ever used.  I feel like a moron for paying any money for this program and it ends up being a ongoing yearly fee. ($99) The only reason I bought this was for the find your phone application but it doesn't work well enough to actually find your phone, all you might get is what block its on. The other applications don't provide anything useful, my email already syncs to my phone, syncing my calendar with my computer is useless since I always have my phone with me why do I need it in two places.

TOTALLY USELESS!!! DO NOT BUY AND WASTE YOUR MONEY! VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
"This software is designed to do everything automatically and this makes it extremely difficult use. I have yet to get the software to communicate with any of my accounts at 3 separate banks. The software always shows there is a connection problem with my bank's site such as US Bank, Bank of America, and Chase. I can however always log into the bank's site directly via a web browser. I work in IT as a systems administrator therefore I feel I am very capable of using Quicken. I really wish I had saved my $ 60.00 and chosen not to purchase this product. DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I upgraded, reluctantly, in January from Quicken 2006 to Quicken 2009.

I only upgraded because the 2006 version will cease downloading account data in April. I am not that happy about it, but $20 per year for software that I use quite a bit is not horrible.

Despite all the doom and gloom reviews, I have not found the 2009 functionality to be any worse than the 2006 version...though I have not found it to be much better either.

One plus is that some accounts which required manual download in Q2006 are now automatic in Q2009.

If you have Q2006, your upgrade will likely work fine based on my experience. I have a bunch of data for 10 years and download information from 35 accounts at 9 institutions"
"The 3 machine license is not as advertised, you'll be disappointed if you think you are going to get a 3 machine 1 year FULL VALUE, that's not the deal. If all of your machines expire on exactly the same day, then you get that. If there is any anomaly, the license expires when you FIRST registered no matter when that was. Customer Support is just what you'd expect from a huge foreign conglomerate- useless, unless you like defensive pre-recorded platitudes."
"Downloaded KIS7 because previous subscription was expiring. During load it said to remove old K product first (why didn't the installation program remove it?) After tedious and time consuming process it finally loaded. Then it said database is obsolete (over one year old).  Why didn't it download the current database? When I clicked the button to update, it said the site could not be found.  The product shut off all access to the network (Internet, email, LAN).  I disabled all the protection, still no access to the net.

Then I tried to remove the program; it wouldn't let me! Other programs on my computer ran, but KIS7 wouldn't let itself be removed (isn't that what a virus does?). Then I tried to restart. KIS wouldn't let me restart!  At the risk of really screwing things up, I had no alternative but to cut power! I crossed my fingers that my computer still ran. Low and behold, KIS7 was gone, and I had access to the net.  But now I don't have any anti-virus protection!

Apparently ""customer service"" is best found on K's forum. The ""expert"" said not to use the standard MS removal program, but to use K's special program (why didn't the download instructions say that?). Then he said to create a ""GSI log"" which requires a tool from...the internet. But wait...KIS7 prevents me from having internet access!!!

What a nightmare! A day later, I am far worse off than I was yesterday at this time.  I use my computer for work, not to troubleshoot someone's lousy software! I thought I was being proactive by renewing two weeks early. Not sure what to do now except find an AVS that works and try to get a refund from K or the credit card company.

Moral of the story: I should have read the Amazon reviews rather than rely on magazine reviews!

7/29/08 UPDATE:  ""Customer Service"" was unable to solve the problem. They finally offered a copy of KIS 2009 or a refund.  I wasn't about to shoot myself in the other foot and try 2009, and I needed antivirus protection, so after days of troubleshooting on my own I was able to install KIS7 (I'm not about to release the details - why should I help Kaspersky? They need to fix their product.).

It runs ok; startup is faster than Norton but slower than KAV6, but IE is MUCH slower. Even after a complete scan and 5 years of virus free operation, the ""Proactive Defense"" (which runs continuously) generated 650MB of reports in 4 hours!!! Besides eating up memory quickly, it definitly slow things down.  My computer ran fine (and faster) before using it (PD), what's the point now?

Obviously KIS7 has problems!  (Otherwise they wouldn't be pushing KIS2009 and offering rebates on Amazon)."
I have been using TTax for many years this version seems to take a long time to boot up.  Seems like previous years it was easy to move around in the menu's get input the tax data as it comes in.
"I am a long time user for WordPerfect version X3. Iam dissapionted in X5 as it has little or no new features compared to X3 that would make it more powerful and all of the same bugs. Also conversions from MS-Word to X5 destroys the format just as X3 and leaves a lto of cleanup work. Its a nice programm but if you already have X3 the upgarde is a waist of money.

As a professional graphic designer I have found this package well worth the purchase. With stock photo CDs starting at $300 there is bound to be something on here you can use. Very easy to use and you get an excellent preview of the image. Everything is high resolution. And you'll find many of the same images that are postage stamp size in the Hemera Big Box of Art. Just remember that these are DVDs so your computer will need to be able to read them.
have not been able to put on kindle
"For a free product, it does a very good job of updating often."
Works great for cross platform testing. The ability to have a separate VPN tunnel open on both systems is a huge timesaver.
I love it ! You have to work on it but it is worth it.
"I was really excited when the QB Premier 2011 version advertised new upgrades.  As a non-profit organization driven by fund accounting, using ""classes"" is absolutely necessary. Being able to get balances by class is a big help, but it still needs some work.  It would be nice to have more reporting capabilities by class, but hopefully Intuit will address this in future versions.  Overall I really like this version.  I am still learning as I have only had this a couple of months and hope to learn more as I use it.  I am sure there are ""buried"" capabilities that I don't know about but will find as time goes on."
"Software seems to have glitches.  It does not display properly on the screen. It loads too low down on the screen and does not allow you to select on-screen buttons.  Not able to use.

I feel this would be a good product if problems are fixed."
Our company needed an update on Quickbooks to allow us to do payroll. I purchased this  and It has fulfilled all of our current needs. Easy to use.
"This is total stupid to ask for a review on a 5 year old item
electronics has replaced this product"
"I downloaded Deluxe and did half my return.  I saved it but when I tried to continue I got an error message.  After several tries with the same result, I started a new return.  Before I wasted another hour I saved it.  Yup, I couldn't open it. About the only TT help is a message board.  No phone help.  No chat help.  Eventually I tried to ""repair"" the down load.  That didn't work.  Then I uninstalled and reinstalled.  That worked but I wasted at least an hour fooling around when I should have been able to get help.  I've used TT for years but I don't know about next year."
Like it better than  the big brand
"I have been using Microsoft Streets and Trips for many years. This is still my preferred mapping software for the following reasons :

- Ease of use
- Accurate and up-to-date information. The program constantly checks for the latest updates for route planning
- Information for nearby places (such as restaurants and gas stations..which are great while I am on a trip)
- Free coupons (there is a catch. You get a 14 days/ 25 coupons free trial but then have to pay $30 annual fee)
- excellent customer support. I contacted support once for installation issue. They would continue to follow-up days after to make sure my problems were corrected.

What I would like to see for future enhancements :

- allows exporting of maps to PDAs
- yellow pages for business reference

All in all, this is a great piece of software for my desktop and laptop."
"When I bought this about 6 months ago, I was trying to find something to replace my CA Internet Security because I was unhappy with its performance.

This product is great when it comes to protecting my computer. It found viruses that my old software NEVER did. It has blocked multiple attempts on my PC, and I have had minimal problems with it.

My biggest complaint is that it seems to slow my PC down a bit. However not as bad as others I have used (i.e. Panda, Norton, MacAfee - Don't even waste your money on MacAfee - But that's a different story).

It also takes a longer time to scan the PC, but I like the deep system scan becuase it really finds things that can get into your computer.

I have recommended this product to many ppl, and being in the computer industry for many years, it seems to be one of the best I have come across"
"Massive memory leak from included Chinese-authored file PtSvcHost.exe.  Install this program, do a Ctrl-Alt-Del to start Task Manager, click on ""Show Processes From All Users"" - and watch as PtSvcHost.exe physical memory usage climbs to the maximum.  I mean if you have 18 Gig memory it will take 99%, your system becomes glacial and unstable, Windows asks you to close programs etc.  I've had five chat sessions with tech support over the past three weeks (two were aborted by the techs), and their solution is ""reinstall,"" ""reinstall from our website,"" etc.  None of this has worked.  They have no idea what they are doing.  The best anti-virus solution is to keep this baby off your computer until they fix it."
"Despite paying for, and receiving and entering the activation code for this software, you won't be able to use it till you create an account at the Chief Architect website. Which is another UN/PW combination I don't want or need.

So far, the installation/marketing BS is getting in the way of using the software....not impressed."
Quicken sent an email message warning me that on-line banking on my Quicken 2010 software (the reason I bought it in the first place) will be discontinued unless I pay for an upgrade. I know of no other software that takes away features I already puchased.
"SIMPLE QUESTION: how do I make an exception in the ""Personal Firewall""?  ANSWER:  Perhaps the Software Gods know!  There is absolutely NO documentation for this software ANYWHERE!  And just try to contact Symantec!  JUST TRY!  I have had a terrible experience with Norton Ghost.  I am now going to switch security software for our laptop.  WHAT - ARE - THESE - PEOPLE - THINKING??"
My computer needs the product key code
great..
"This is pure trash. I have a very fast windows XP pro system with a top of the line HP ink jet photosmart all in one printer. I have used Print Master software and Hallmark which I know is also a Nova product. And all have performed  fairly well. But this software takes 5 to 7 minutes to print a simple card or envelope. At first I thought it was a printer issue, but after a HP tech(Great support)had me run some diagonostics it turned out there was no problem with the printer. And I have 4 megs of memory plus about 200 GB of hard drive space available.
I sent (2) unanswered emails to GCF support, and after trying their phone support I was transferred three times and hung up on three times before I could even get past customer support and to a tech.
Even though the software is only a couple of weeks old, I threw it in the trash. Yes, I thought about reselling it, but I wouldn't want to do
that to anybody. Don't waste your money on this product."
Excellent software! You can't go wrong with it. Does exactly as it suppose plus more.
"Have used TurboTax for years, would not even consider anything else anymore as data transfers from one year to next.  Also I have found deductions because of the tremendous support material and info built into the program.  No reservations, highly recommended."
"I work in computers, so pretty computer literate, however, I followed the manual several times (downloading the programs multiple times and restarting) and could not get this product to work.  I could not find a customer service online, but the 'tech support' they offer only seems to be available via email.  I sent 5 customer service emails to the support team regarding this issue, each time requesting a call appointment (which they first said they would arrange), but each time I emailed them for appointment times to arrange, they would deflect with telling me to check something else.  I replied each time with I already tried that and please set up a call and each time they failed to help or schedule. There is no number for them and they refused to call me. I'm just frustrated at this point of weeks of trying and I can't get this to work, so returning."
"I have been using its free version for around 5 years, and that itself is really great. Its realtime protection is great and there is no point in scanning your system (it does perform a quick scan after install). For programmers, it might be a bit annoying because it always scans a newly generated executable, and sometimes might even treat it as a virus and remove it. There it has to be reported as false positive."
"Purchased ""McAfee Total Protection 2012"" from Amazon that arrived with a duplicate ""Product Key"" to one purchased 3000 miles away from Staples a month before.  Contacted the person who's email kept comming up as the register user and he send me a scan of his ""Product Key Card"" and it was a duplicate of mine.
  McAfee from both India and the Philipines politely took control of my computer and uninstalled and reinstalled it multiple time.  Unfortunately they never comprehended that the problem is with their customer subscription database and not on my computer.  I and McAfee was never able to activate the program after they worked 2-1/2 hours on the PC.  Phoned back to get a refund and they refused and said to return it to Amazon.  Three hours wasted from my life."
"I just downloaded the 10.03 update and I must say that I was sadly disappointed.  I was hoping that Smart Photo Fix would no longer apply suggested settings before I clicked on the suggested settings button.  Unfortunately, because suggested settings are applied without my requesting them, I am forced to correct all the settings back to zero before making enhancements.  This is very inconvient.  Every time I want to adjust saturation, shadows or highlights I am forced to go through all of the settings and set them to zero so I can make one change to the photo.  This is a pain!  ""Suggested settings"" are obviously not ""suggested settings"" but rather ""forced down your throat settings"".

Also, the ""color balance tool - advanced options"" does not function correctly.  The sliders that control temperature warmth work exactly the opposite as the on screen instructions indicate.

Corel can we anticipate a fix for these problems?

Update:  Corel sent me a note stating that the Smartphoto fix problem mentioned above was known before 10.02 was released and they were not sure why it had not been fixed.  Now the problem still has not been fixed under 10.03.  Corel appears to be up to their old tactics.  Lots of little problems and promises and never a fix.

My advice:  Think twice!"
"After years of using Quicken or MS Money, I finally stumbled upon this little gem.  YNAB Pro has become the answer to my budgeting prayers.  No more clunky not-user-friendly budgeting software (buh bye Money!  See ya Quicken!).  YNAB makes it easy to create a budget, track your money flow, and get a handle on your financial life.  Like to download your transaction from your bank's site?  Simple and easy to import into Pro.  Follow Jesse's Rules to more stable finances.  Overall, two big thumbs up.  I highly recommend YNAB Pro!"
"So far, this product is what I was looking for. I like the graphics and it is fairly easy to use."
Corel Graphics Suite X4 is a great step forward in the long line of CorelDRAW and CGS tools.  A great value.  Corel continues to provide a product with the tools a professional or an advanced amateur needs to create illustrations and work with today's digital images.
I liked the way the 2013 version worked much better
Bad. Do not buy. It barely even worked for me and when it did I could hardly control what was happening. Don't buy.
"not made for use with windows 7 64 i did not use this prog. norton much better.

We have used Norton since the begaining of computers. I'v used them with all my computers Peter Norton's products have always preformed prefectly.
"I spend a LOT of time post processing my photos.  I have known for a long time how important it is to have your monitor calibrated in order to get the best possible results, but have been too lazy to get a calibration system.  I finally bit the bullet and got the Spyder2 Express.  The program installed very easily and makes a noticeable improvement on the images I see on my monitor.  I have a dual monitor system, but have only calibrated one of the monitors.  This makes it easy to see the difference between the calibrated monitor images and the non-calibrated ones.  It is a BIG difference.  The colors are much richer and details are more visible. For the price this is a great program."
"Can only agree with the 5 star reviews. Very solid. If you are encountering startup errors, check the help forums and FAQs. Windows install was instant and simple. Mac was more complicated due to needing legacy Java and Mac makes installing things like that non-intuitive. But I can now share my models between Windows and MAC. Windows version is running well on a none too powerful laptop running a 32 bit version of Windows 7.
The user forums for exploiting the features for home design are second to none. My 3D model has already revealed a potential mistake I was about to make in my floor plan - door positioning - due to the sloping ceiling!
If I had one big feature request it would be for Android/IOS tablet apps for at least viewing the 3D result, if not for making small tweak to colours/materials"
this is a great product and it was very easy to use. very user friendly and it didn't take long to back up my entire hard drive.
"It has only been operating a few days and I will try to remember to come back in 6 weeks like I did with another program I reviewed but I'll say it now Mcafee rocks.

When I saw this come up for vine review I jumped on it as I have it on my other comuter and I cannot express enough how great it is.
Anti-Virus+spyware protection It's working and you don't have to do a thing. It
Detects, blocks, and removes viruses, spyware, adware , trojains and worms. The quickscan feature does a computer checkup in 6-9 min. If you have a ton of programs like I do. It also lists warnings for you to keep an eye on.

I love the website safety ratings~It stops and alerts you of dangerous websites before you click on them. We all know about phishing and this great program warns you anytime there is an attempt to get your personal information. It then blocks it to keep your info safe.

The network manager fixes my security issues my computer may have. I don't have to do anything at all it is running in the backbround 24/7 and alerts me to any and all problems if they occur.  I am terrible about doing backups and now I don't have to worry It saves my important files automatically.

I've said this before in previous versions I have that the shredder is wonderful. It gets rid of confidential documents that can never be retrieved on your hard drive. Never.

I have noticed a huge reduction of spam mail in my file. My internet provider has a spam blocker and I used to see 500 ++ messages a day there to delete. Now I see around 18.

One of the most important features to me is that I can do all my on line buying and banking and not worry my account numbers are being tracked or pin numbers monitored by scam artists.

I have a popular brand computer and it came with 15 months free McAfee and when it was expired I went with a free on line one. It kept me safe but did not have all the features and warnings that this has.  Thanks Amazon for great deals as always and I love that now all my computers are protected.

This is a great deal here at Amazon.com for a year of worry free on line internet use.

Been in use now a little over 3 weeks and I am very happy with it. It has been catching Trojians like crazy and I love that it warns me of harmfull websites when I am doing a search and a bunch of websites come up.( I'm talking daily) Sometimes I wll be on a webpage and it pops up saying the site it trying to get personal information do I wish to continue. No I don't and I get out. This is the best!"
"Wanted this for copying a handful of old VHS documentary tapes. For this purpose it has been just fine... I have an HP Vista laptop with an AMD Turion 64 x2 mobile tl60 processor, 3072 mbs of Ram.

Originally I was looking at the Pinnacle DVD Recorder (that doesn't include the Pinnacle 12 software. Fortunately I got lucky and found this on sale at Best Buy for less than the Pinnacle DVD Recorder.

Unfortunately my old VCR only has composite hookups... so the included software for recording straight to a DVD didn't seem to work for me... however using Pinnacle 12 to first save it to my hard drive and then save it to DVD has worked just fine. The quality for a documentary is good, not great (but then the VHS tape it's transferring from is good, not great).

Video processing is time intensive and it's going to take you a while... it's certainly not like ripping mp3s... LOL...

Although I haven't used all the included Pinnacle software for creating and editing home videos, I used Pinnacle software years ago (maybe version 2 or 3) for this then and it was very intuitive and simple (sorta like Video software for Dummies) back then.

When I weigh the costs of paying someone to professionally transfer VHS tapes to DVD ([...] bucks a pop) or attempting to find and buy them on DVD, against doing it with Dazzle, I've thus far saved a lot of money. However, if you're looking to transfer your old Star Wars VHS tape to DVD, then you probably won't be happy with the quality... give it up and buy the DVD... LOL

One more caution: If you have an older Sony Digital Tape camcorder (or an 8mm), like me, then you'll have to spring for a upgrade to Pinnacle 12 plus software."
"It works!!  Fast and easy.  I have access to all my music purchased at Amazon, from all my devices, and any time I want it.
Love this service."
"Says it is Win 8 compatible, but it never loaded.  Contacted Customer Support and their suggestion of D:setup.exe doesn't work either."
"price went up so the efile is not really free; plus they charge ten bucks for each additional return, even if printed, plus efile fees if the return is not printed.

They've lost my business."
Easy to use and always gets me back more money then H&R Block
"This is pretty easy straight forward to use. you can even download a digital version of the disk they give you. can take your cds and make them dvds
digitalize lp and tapes, can capture shots from you tube and other sites. Can also quickly convert and clean up raw pictures you might have. I used this one to make a video for my kids of the baby pictures we have of them. Step by step instructions made even me a non computer person have an easy time using this product. I even let them pick their favorite song to set this all too. They had a ton of fun with me and now we have a great memory too.
it has many more features I did not mention. Really is well thought out and easy to use"
Have used turbo tax for at least 5 years and have been satisfied every time.  Both Federal and State taxes made easy for even a lunkhead like me!
"Im enjoying going through the training sessions included with Pinnacle 18.  Clear, concise, and fairly brief, they cover the essentials and then some.  Following them, I have discovered that I want more control than that offered by Smart Movie, but what is offered beyond that entry level is more advanced but not so complex that I cannot master it with ease.

I would like to have more options for formats in output.  Other than that, Im a happy camper.

FOUR STARS!"
"I bought this thinking I could make some videos for YouTube. Well, so much for that. Lets just say I never got it to work.
Right out of the box, it pops up with a ""Would you like to watch a demo video?"" after the inital installation. That failed to work. I upload a video from my new Android Razor, Mpeg4. The video plays fine, the audio is sped way up. I cant figure out why. I go to the help menu, ""Help menu - Failed to connect"". I go to the support website. You have to become a member by the way to ask for help.... Well, after filling out all the info, they have that weird way of writing a code word that you have to read and then write in the box. THEY ARE TOTALLY UNREADABLE! I tried like a dozen times to get one that I can read and always failed.

Let me put it this way this Software is FAILURE!!!!!! Do yourself a favor and choose something else. MAGIX if you read this review by anychance, contact me because I want my money back! I will slam this product every way I can."
My accounted suggested me using this program for my new small home based business. Its not too complicated. But I really didn't use it to its fullest extent. But it did what I needed it to and was easy to navigate.
"It is an excellent accounting product, however Sage must create a more flexible way to access their products. I bought a Premium version 2012 and I was using a Distribution 2009 and no way was possible to transfer my data files; I was obliged to upgrade to a Premium Distribution 2012. I did not like this tricky marketing manner to sell their different versions."
Microsoft Office Home and Student 2016 key loaded with out a single problem.  And I didn't have to redo my printer drivers.  I think that the program key is a lot easyer than loading CD's.
"I am having exactly the same problem as those who made comments in May 2007. There's no serial number in the box. I just contacted tech support. There should be a fix on the site right now but a search on ""serial number"" leads to nothing about this obvious problem. I'll bet they are getting questions every 5 minutes in this regard. Why not have an item right out front about how to take care of this?

Has anyone gotten this problem resolved yet??

"After buying Norton Internet Security for about ten years, I read too many unhappy reviews.  I had some problems installing Norton, but it caused a serious problem with Internet Explorer.  It crashing at least twice a day.  A friend asked if I had Norton and said they often caused problems with Internet Explorer.  I tried ZONE ALARM Internet Security Suite for three computers [Amazon sells it].  It installed quickly after I answered three questions.  It completely installed and it set-up the Firewall and all basic security provisions. I just sat back and watched it install.  I will never go back to the Norton problems again.  Norton seems to have forgotten how to make a program install without some headaches."
Amazing deal and pro product
Get this if you want Windows 10 for cheap so you can free upgrade in a month.
"I am a short story writer that is now trying to write scripts. After reading a number of scripts, I was very concerned that I would have to go through all kinds of hoops to keep the formatting and pagination. In fact, I put off starting a script because I was so worried about it. My friends recommended Final Draft. As soon as I sat down and installed it, I realized I had nothing to worry about.  I was able to start expressing my ideas quickly and easily. Now all I have to do is finish a script and sell it!"
"it would not work on windows 7, no good for my computer."
I was really impressed with Norton 360. It found a trojan and fixed it right away. I had McAfee beforehead and it did not detect this problem. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in protecting their laptop or desktop.
"I was unable to find  information on boot camp encryption in the Parallels user guide or knowledge base, so before I purchased the software, I called Parallels customer service. A sales or tech rep told me I could encrypt the Windows boot camp partition, so I ordered the software from Amazon. Sunday I installed Parallels Desktop 10 on my Macbook Pro 2014 boot camp partitioned for Windows 8.1 and Yosemite. Parallels installed easily and worked as expected until I tried to encrypt Windows boot camp and the virtual machine. I received the following error message: ""Encryption settings could not be applied. The virtual machine uses a physical hard disk.""

There are two choices for a Windows install from a boot camp partition: Windows using the boot camp partition, which makes changes in both the virtual machine and the boot camp partition and Windows using only a virtual machine, which means Windows is imported and installed on your Mac and there are no changes to the boot camp partition. There are four things listed that you cannot do when using the Windows boot camp partition to run Parallels. The inability to use encryption is not one of them.

After finding out I could not encrypt Windows boot camp, I called Parallels tech support early Monday morning. The technician I spoke with was difficult for me to understand, but he said the answer was yes, you could encrypt your boot camp partition, and he would send me information to solve the problem. The email I received from him at the end of the day resolving my problem had nothing to do with what I wanted to know. This morning, Wednesday, I finally received an answer from the fifth tech support person I either called or who responded to my email: Sorry, no, you cannot encrypt the Windows partition using Parallels. His email response was the only timely one, answering email I sent last night.

My advice: Use the trial version before paying for the licensing key, which is what you are buying from Amazon. The Parallels kb says you download the same program either way and only need a license to continue using it after 14 days. Of course, that is what I should have done."
"After about a month using AVG Internet Security, I am pleased with the level of protection.  It's as good as the others I've tried in the past (ie. norton, avast, trend micro...), and it doesn't slow down my system.  Had problems registering the product and locating customer service on their website, but I eventually got a reply from them within a week.  It works."
"I compared the OCR processing of a printed letter containing a logo using OmniPage17 and Acrobat 9 Professional. OmniPage required several prompts to correct suspects and handled the logo as text. Acrobat on the other hand processed the file seamlessly and correctly.

The good news is that the company stood by its 30-day money back guarantee.
My advice is to give it a try. If it works for you, fine. Otherwise you can be certain of getting a prompt refund."
Installation was difficult but everything is working well enough after a week of use.  I still have some problems with this new operating system but perhaps I will figure it out over time.
LOVE IT
It's great it came just as they described it.
"I have used several versions of this program over the past 5 years...don't ask me why.
The lastest version is even more glitchy...if that's possible.
My latest problem was trying to load the media manager..it won't load.
I always receive an error message saying that the progrom won't load because it has stopped. How can it be stopped...it won't even start !
You can only get help via e-mail unless you want to pay and pay.
The problem is...even the CUSTOMER SERVICE program is full of bugs...Everytime I try to create a service ticket...and then hit send..I receive an error message.
What a mess. Don't buy this program unless you have a lot of time on your hands...and enjoy being fustrated."
"I found the course very helpful, with detailed instuction on dry fire practice, proper combat stance, and how they improve accuracy."
could not load this item on my desk nor my lab top computer. A great waste od money. I definitely would like refund
Quick download and very easy to use.
PowerDVD is the absolute worst software I've had to use in 10 years. It will not play back your movies for such a wide variety of stupid reasons that I'm not even going to go into details. Suffice it to say that you should spend your money elsewhere. Do not give these glorified spyware pushers any money if you value the freedom and usability of your computer. Thank you.
I bought this for a trip to italy and wish i didn't waste the money.  The maps were outdated.  It tried sending us on roads that didn't exist and didn't have many of the paved public roads that we were driving on.
"First the good news.  I've been using Acronis True Image for several years.  It has saved me more than once, so I was predisposed to like the product.  They recently told me that there was an update.. it was cheap.. and they offered additional licenses for free.  How could I resist?

Well.. in retrospect, I wouldn't have done it.  The new user interface is confusing.  In fairness, it might just be that it is ""different"", but I find it hard to use.  Second, it's a dog.  It seems like I spend a lot of time looking at frozen screens with a ""(Not responding)"" message in the title bar.  I don't recall having that problem with previous versions.  I like to start a backup image running as I leave the office for lunch or a meeting.  It used to be easy to do that.  Now it freezes/pauses in the midst of a lot of questions that it asks you, so I can't just start it and walk away like I used to.  It does eventually start working, but it's a frustrating process.  I also seem to remember that it used to keep my ThinkPad alive when running.  Now, I come back and find that my laptop has gone to sleep and the backup has locked up.  That's probably something that I have to change in my power management settings, but I can't remember it ever being an issue before.

Finally, a number of reviewers have said that things just don't work - and that they get little sympathy from tech support.  I honestly haven't had that problem yet.. but I haven't had a catastrophic failure since I upgraded, so I haven't tried a full image restore.  Makes me nervous!

I think they must have run into the classic ""QuickBooks/Quicken dilemma"".  They produced an inexpensive well functioning product, and then realized that they had no revenue stream, since there was no compelling reason to ever upgrade.  So they mess around with the user interface every year to get you to think that it's ""better"".  If you have the 2010 version, I'd advise you to skip this one.  Maybe they'll work out the problems in the 2012 version... It just doesn't seem to work as well as the version I replaced.  It's still inexpensive, but I can't see any justification for spending even the modest price of the upgrade.

*******************  FOLLOWUP COMMENTS (3/12/11)************* *************************************************************
Something is just not right here.  I've been using True Image Home for years, and until the 2011 version, would have given it 5 stars.

I upgraded to 2011 and nothing has been the same since.  My first problem was that it was painfully slow.  I'd get screens with a ""not responding"" message.  I posted an unflattering review here, citing that problem, and I got a response from a tech named ""Yana"".  Yana told me that there was an unreleased new build available. I downloaded it and, sure enough, it resolved the ""not responding"" issue.

Unfortunately, it introduced another problem.  I always do FULL backups.  With the new build, EVERY time I do a backup and then try to shut down the computer, I'm held hostage for 20-30 minutes with a ""Operations are in progress"" message, which prevents an orderly shutdown.  This happens even if I do the shutdown hours after the backup has completed.  Once it has completed whatever the heck it is doing, I'm all set until I try to do another backup.

Yana corresponded with me for a while and suggested that I download their Schedule Manager.  When you run this, it takes you to a command prompt, which allows you to ""ZAP"" all scheduled tasks.  I can't see any scheduled tasks and did not intentionally create any.  Doing this does eliminate the shutdown issue, but I sometimes forget, and it's a real pain. Yana suggested that there might be some kind of corrupt driver issue, and then simply disappeared.  I've tried over several weeks to reestablish communication, but can't get any kind of response from Yana.

I submitted additional support requests and have been contacted by other techs.  They are friendly and polite in that perfunctory/boilerplate ""your call is very important to us.. sorry for the inconvenience ..."" way, but neither has been able to explain to me what is going on or how to stop it.  One again suggested corrupt drivers and had me download a fix.  That didn't work and then that tech disappeared.  Another support request and another tech... this one tells me that this is the way the program is supposed to work.

I Googled the issue and find that a lot of people have the problem.  I never had it before.  I don't understand it.  I don't like it, and I can't find a way to turn it off.  I take my laptop with me to client sites, so it's on and off several times a day.  I can't wait 1/2 hour for the machine to shut down.

I'll typically start a backup when I'm leaving the office for a while without the machine.  I expect the machine to be functional when I return.  So far, I've found two workarounds.  One approach is to do the scheduler ""ZAP"".  The other is to set the backup so that it shuts the machine down afterwards.  The downside of approach #2 is that I have to make sure I allow for the additional 1/2 hour for the ""operations in progress"" thing to complete.  The other problem is that the machine is off when I return, so I have to restart it.  Not a huge deal, but why do I have to put up with this hassle?

Bottom line advice.  If you have a previous version of True Image that is working for you, DO NOT UPGRADE!!!  I'd even be suspicious about downloading an update for your version.  Maybe they will explain it eventually.  Maybe they will even fix it.  Until then, stay far far away from this version."
Amazing OS but sadly I have an I7 6700k Processor so I had to upgrade to windows 10.
"It performed to my expectations. I prefer WordPerfect Office Suite over anything Microsoft puts out. Keep up the good work. One final note, please  don't do like Microsoft and lease your office suite. That is a major turnoff."
Used this to renew 360 on three PC's.  Received it within a  few days of ordering and successfully renewed on all three computers.  I have been using Norton 360 for three years.  It has been the best security software I have ever used.  I love the identity safe password protector along with all the other tools included with  Norton 360.  Plus the price on Amazon is about half what you pay on Norton's website.
This is my second time using this product in my computers and had no problems. This product works well for me and I will continue to use it. Thank you very much.
"Download was easy, then you can go back to Amazon on each PC you want to download it on.  Very easy to do!"
Makes learning to type or increase your speed fun with different games and challenges.
I have a Garmin Vista C.  Software is very easy to use. Thought the software would of had more details.  Not much different from my older version :(
"Great value. Although, Google docs is free and way better. But...for excel alone, great value."
"I give this rating  ""minus stars."" It was brand new when I first tried to use it. As soon as I turned it on, it went on for less than a second and turned off. I tried it in two cars, but it did not work. I tried writing to the company, Tandy Brands, and it looks as if they went out of business. I can see why with this kind of product. Very disappointing."
This program is a must to have if you are in the engineering program.  I have used this program over and over again on many school and work projects!
"I have used Everything from Norton to Kaspersky and this one works. It does not slow your computer down either. Don't ask me how they do it because I do not know? I have 2 copies of this product for both of my computers and it works well. I have not had a single hit, ever. Strange name, Yes, Who Cares?"
"This looks like a very comprehensive accounting program, and for a business bigger than mine it would probably work quite well.

In truth, I don't need all the bells and whistles offered here, and had the software not been provided free via the Amazon Vine program, I undoubtedly would not have purchased it."
"The trainer in the DVD is excellent; he explained everything step by step, since I am new to Maya but experience using 3D Max that may help a little."
"This review is for Movies on CD and DVD 2005, but since it is mostly about their tech support, I think it is relevant.

My experience with Magix products as well as their technical support has been bad and I recommend avoiding them at all costs if you want to save yourself the trouble I went through.

Last year I purchased Magix's Movies on CD and DVD in hope of using it to transfer my Hi8 tapes to DVDs. I was able to capture movies and edit scenes, but the product didn't work with my DVD burner. My emails to customer support have remained unanswered to this day. In the meantime they announced a new version of the product, Movies on CD and DVD 2005, so I decided to wait for it to come out, as their user interface and features seemed ok for what I needed.

The new  version finally came out in the fall of 2004 and I bought it. I tried to capture my movies then burn them on DVD. The capture went fine, and then I proceeded to automatic scene recognition. When I started the editing process I realized the preview and the cursor  position on the timeline or storyboard view were out of sync. This makes editing a movie difficult if not impossible. I tried to recapture the movie, change settings etc, but nothing helped. I then decided to contact tech support.

I first sent them an email explaining the problem, but after 3 days I received a reply saying that I should use the tech support submission form on the website. I went there and ran their utility which captured all my system settings and I explained the problem again and submitted my request after which I received an email with a case number.

I didn't receive any reply for the next several days, so I decided to call them. A bored and annoyed guy answered and after I explained that I had sent several emails, he said that case numbers are actually not used and don't mean anything to them. After a short discussion, his answer to my problem was that (and I paraphrase) ""this is the first time I heard about this issue, so it must be something wrong with your computer"". Whenever I tried to bring up arguments showing that a bug in their software was a plausible possibility as well, he kept repeating the same mantra. Finally he asked me for my email address saying that he would send me an utility for gathering more info about my configuration, but I never received anything from him.

I then decided to ask for a refund so I called again. I was transferred to another person in tech support who sounded more like a manager, in the sense that he was not as belligerent as the other tech support person, and after he apologized for the problem I was experiencing, he said that he would ask the developers to look into the issue, but that he could not give me a refund. He also confirmed that case numbers are useless. I decided to give them one more chance, so at his request, I resent him the email with my configuration and description of the problem. I even offered to send them my video to see if they can reproduce the problem and issue a fix After several days without a sign from them, I sent a new email asking him to confirm that he received it, and also to let me know when I would get an answer. No reply.

I then decided to escalate the request and I sent an email to their public relations person in Germany where I explained again everything that happened. As you may have guessed, no reply this time either.

I am still waiting for them to reply or fix my problem.

Based on my experience, Magix customer service and tech support are totally useless (unless you are calling to buy something), and customers are important to them only until they have purchased the product, afterwards they don't matter any more."
"Provides a lot of information but very little in the way of interaction.  Also, as the tutorial progresses it does not highlight the area in which it speaks about leaving the student to wonder what exactly the narrator is talking about."
"I bought this primarily to put time limits on my kids iPad/iPhone usage. The software allows me to set allowed/blocked hours, but not set time total time limits. I checked with Norton support on this and they confirmed that Time Limits are not support on iOS. I think Norton could do a better job of differentiating features available on IOS compared to Windows. I should have used the free-trial first, now I'm stuck with it!"
"I have worked with this - tried to use it over and over again - read the help manual, watched the viedos, etc.  This thing is So hard to use, not intutive, has many bugs so often I am doing exactly what I should be but still not getting the result."

"I've been using Paint Shop Pro since version 4, and have used PSP4 and PSP8 extensively.  I also have an older copy of Photoshop, version 7, which I use quite a bit.  A couple weeks ago, I downloaded the trial version of PSP X2 Ultimate.  As I became used to the interface, I found myself using Photoshop and the older versions of PSP less and less.  There are many things to like about X2 Ultimate, and relatively few annoyances.  I plan on purchasing a copy once the trial period runs out.

Most of my work with these products involves processing of images from my DSLR and scanning and processing slides and negatives.  I find X2 Ultimate much easier to use than Photoshop, and more convenient to use than PSP8.  Many of my old slides have taken on a magenta cast, which I find is more accurately removed by X2 Ultimate than by either PS7 or PSP8.  However, the primary tool that I use to correct the color cast -- ""Color Balance"" is not as easy to use as the same tool in PSP8.  It's been dumbed down and if additional refinements are needed, the controls left are not as effective as those used in PSP8.  I have found that X2 Ultimate does an admirable job at removing grain and/or noise from images, with several different tools that can be employed.  The High Pass sharpening feature is a welcome addition, and I find myself using it frequently.

X2 Ultimate does require more computer oomph, though.  I have it installed on an older system running XP with a 1.2 ghz processor and ""only"" 768MB RAM.  This is plenty of power for the other imaging software I use, even Photoshop, but X2 Ultimate definitely lags, swapping memory to and from the hard drive frequently.  I use a tablet for some editing chores.  X2 supports pen pressure for variable width lines (PSP8 does not, although PS7 does), but the drawn output does lag behind the cursor on my system, while the lag is negligible with either PSP8 or PS7.

The fact that X2 Ultimate will require that I either add RAM to my system, or upgrade it altogether for performance to improve is why I give this product 4 stars instead of 5."
"I purchased the ulead pictureshow instead of the nero elite because of the reviews i read in amazon.  This is one of the worst software packages i have ever used, the help file was too general and for the several problems i had, it was no help at all.  What little clip art to use is so poor and to import anything was an endless task.  Also if you wanted to use any type of audio it had to be pathed exact, I still was not able to add any audio. I have used several programs for this type of work - this is the worst!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It's going back!"
Wouldn't want to face tax season without TurboTax.  I have used it for years.
"This product is new. I can't install it. It thinks there is no internet connection. I wonder how the program came up with that since I have a fine internet connection.
The support is strictly email. The Corel/Roxio people think that it is normal for the consumer/customer to spend several hours through emails in order to get installation help. Having no emergency support phone number, or a *one-time help* on simply installing newly purchased software shows just how abysmal the Corel/Roxio office is. The only phone number available is the sales staff who are located somewhere outside the Milky-way Galaxy. Or so they sound. It was offered that I could pay for phone support. Yes. They will gladly take money from me to get help on installing their software.
Do they really think consumers are going to *PAY* for service on installing a program?"
"Over the years I tried all the others; they either failed to protect my computer or made my life miserable trying to cope with the problems they created. With Webroot I have no headaches, and its quick and simple to use. The scan takes a minute or so, not hours."
Tax program that works well.
"Old style rendering, it is not the sharp photo-realistic 3D I was expecting.  However, it was okay for it's time."
Perfect for grandson....he loves it!
"This software is an excellent addition to my audio/video products.

Ease of use for burning music cds and videos due to excellent instructions.

The volume leveling is great!

Video editing tools perfect for home video

Highly recommended"
"Software took over 2 weeks to arrive, and would not run on my brand new MacBook Pro.  Using free NeoOffice (OpenOffice for Mac) instead."
Always a good software program.  Guides you every step of the way.  Keeps your depreciation schedule from year to year.
Difficult to use.  I spent time  transcribing my recipes to the software and I am not able to access them.  I wrote customer support but never received a reply.  I am attempting to get a refund.
Software worked fine after getting updates.  You need to go to the Apple website to get the latest updates for the software to operate correctly.
"Product was legitimate software, loaded without a hitch, works fine.  Shipment was on time, entire order process went well."
It works fine
"Very good software, suit my needs."
"perfect.  quick , simple, easy!"
"TurboTax is awesome, i use it every year. I love the fact that it remembers everything you filled out from last year so you only have to make some small changes and hit send, all done!! Amazon had the best price too, it was $10 less than it is at all the office stores, and $20 less than full price. Make sure you get the right edition though, you really have to look through all the features and get state if you need it."
"Quicken 2014 seems to be a better product over the previous Quicken products, but when it deleted the other versions of Quicken, it caused problems when it had to be reloaded due to computer issues.  This should not have happened as many people only upgrade and do not buy the complete product.  It should just update the older version and leave the older version alone as in the past.  It is also good that it has the capability to sync with mobile devices which was also a feature on Quicken 2013 but has been enhanced on this version."
"I like my Quicken starter edition ok but it will never replace Microsoft Money which I used previously. Maybe it is just that I was so used to Money & can't quite get the hang of new software. I have had trouble with their ""help"" when I have a question. It still won't download any bank interest when I update my accounts. I can't seem to connect to their ""help"" people to let me know if that can be fixed."
Printmaster is just awesome.... I hope they continue to grow...
Excellent computer protection as usual.  No longer includes backup program.
"I have used Quicken for Mac since the first version - this is worse than ANY of those. No bill-pay. No tax planner. No export to Turbo Tax. No tracking of indivicual investments. Does not even print checks!  So what the heck does it do?  All it does is import your data and show you were you spend your money - it's a glorified spread sheet.  Mint does that for free - and a lot easier.

The bottom line - it does almost nothing, yet is complicated and still hard to use.

I will be reselling it on Amazon - if there is anyone who wants this worthless software. I will go back to a previous version or find a new money management program. Don't waste your time - this is not worth the time and effort, even if it was free.

A complete waste and rip-off.  Intuit, shame on you."
I have used this product for several years and have always been pleased with the clean running condition of my computer.
"Corel is a good alternative for me versus the more expensive Microsoft Office. I use it mainly for word processing. There is nothing I miss from Microsoft Word that I don't get with Corel. I love that I can save the file written in Corel as a .doc file so I can easily open it at school computers, etc. I also like the fact Corel doesn't automatically format some things in the document that I don't want like Microsoft Word used to do. For instance, whenever I opened word documents in MS Word, it automatically gave me line spacing every time I pushed ""return"" so I would have to go in and reconfigure. I don't have those issues with Corel which is very much appreciated. This is a good product with solid basics for office needs."
Good price. Used it in France in and around Paris and then in Normandy in September 2013. Not as detailed as GPS maps in the US but a lot more convenient than using road maps.
"I'm not a big ""gamer"" don't have a lot of time for it, but I like word games that, supposedly, help keep my brain sharp.  This is a good one.  The only negative is when it's scoring at the end of a session.  It takes forever to total as it gets into the millions and is still running.  I finally just stopped it."
"I have tried many Security software on my pc ,but with Webroot I only have to install and let it do the rest . Best pc security I have ever bought"
"What I liked most about this product was its easy non-spam like installation.  Unlike so many other products in this category, this product installs professionally, does not attempt to sell you other products you do not want, and is not confusing at all in its configuration.

Another great aspect is it is so much less intrusive on my day to day use of my machines.  Other anti-virus protection would constantly be consuming my CPU even though configured to run only at night or when use is low.  My system would slow to a crawl.

With this product, I notice no degradation in performance whatsoever.  I barely know the product is there unless I want to run a scan or change a setting.

I have installed it now on three machines.  Our server and two laptops.  And it works flawlessly.

I think anyone would prefer the ease of use and non-intrusive behavior of this product over the competitive products out there."
"Downloaded this to open my graduate school ebook.  It would not open the ebook.  I was forced to drop the course.  When I inquired about the Amazon ebook return policy, I only got the runaround and had to eat the price for an ebook download that I could not use.  The way I see it, a Kindle ebook reader should be expected to be commpatible with any Kindle ebook.  I guess I was mistaken."
Works good.
No local channels
"I had the chance to test Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 at work and I was SOOOO surprized at how much improved the voice recognition had become.  Last time I gave Dragon a test was back when Dragon Naturally Speaking 10 Professional was brand new.  Dragon NaturallySpeaking has always been a solid product that worked well in all my experiences over the years but, Dragon NaturallySpeaking was always tempormental.  I have cerebral palsy so modulating my voice came hard hence I always found more troube than it was worth using for dictation.

Well not to long ago I was asked at work to test Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 and WOW I was so shocked by its awesome performance that I nearly lost it.  Oh I expected a slight improvement with Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 because; with each version upgrade Dragon NaturallySpeaking always got better.  I always liked testing Dragon NaturallySpeaking but it was not until Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 that I actually ENJOYED using Dragon NaturallySpeaking for dictation.

Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 loads easily on Windows 7-32 bit systems provided you have ample RAM \ ROM Memory, Sound Card and CPU resources on a quality system.  Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 was never slow or lagged during my testing.  Matter of fact Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 is down right eager compared to any of the earlier Dragon versions.  Now all I had open was Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 and Word or Wordpad so the drain on computer resources was not great.  Surely if you use Dragon NaturallySpeaking in conjunction with many other resource intensive software programs or apps you might see degradation in Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 performance.

I can't speak for versions other than Dragon NaturallySpeaking Professional 12 because; I have not used them.  I can say Dragon NaturallySpeaking Professional 12 is a total and complete winner, the best Dragon I ever used bar none.  With the right computer configuration and high quality USB microphone there is no beating Dragon NaturallySpeaking Professional 12.  Five of the brightest ratings stars I have ever given go to Dragon NaturallySpeaking Professional 12 because properly configured it is really THAT GOOD!"
"This years 2002 Turbo Tax is a piece of [bad]. I am extremely unhappy with intuit for making us use this activation nonsense. It was a major inconvenience for me because I don't have internet access at home, I use a cell phone for my home phone, so I had to install it on my employers computer. Between the activation, the marketing [software], I will be switching to something else next year. This will be the last time I use Intuit products. Too bad for you Intuit... Looks like you .... a lot of people off. You won't be getting this customer back."
Very satisfied with turbo tax 2015
Love it
"Microsoft has done it again! Outlook with Business Contact Manager 2007 is a very solid, simple, and intuitive small business platform to work from. I have been in sales for over 10 years and have used a variety of solutions, including ACT and I like Business Contact Manager the best so far. If you enjoy actually selling as opposed to updating information continually, this is the solution for you. For instance, ACT has many useless and cumbersome bells and whistles that require input of information multiple times in multiple screens. Microsoft left these out...thankfully. In fact, I spent more time updating information in ACT than actually using it to be productive. Act is also prone to databases corruption. Our data in ACT was corrupted at least 2-3 times in a year. ACT Synchronization is finicky at best. And ACT integration to accounting software is cumbersome and expensive. Microsoft has trimmed the fat and created a very streamlined platform that gets the job done. No corruption of data thus far. Accounting software integration is a breeze-I use Microsoft Accounting 2007-also a very solid small business solution if you don't need automated Payroll-a less expensive option to QuickBooks.  Only having to enter information once, simple customization, and seamless 2-way integration with accounting software is why I gave this a 5. It is not perfect but it is the best I have used thus far. Highly recommended. You will not be disappointed."
"I'm giving the demo a try... it won't load at times, and it crashes when editing too."
No stars if there were negative five stars ratings would assign them to this product!! Tore up my computer microsoft had to work on it remote from India for 2 days. Got a refund !! Thank God!!
I love my Fluenz French program. I originally bought the old version last year and loved working on the different exercises. Recently I switched from a PC to a Mac and was sad to see the old version of Fluenz French would not work on my new computer. I emailed the Fluenz customer service department to see if I could upgrade to F2 which works on both Mac and PC computers. This is where Fluenz became the #1 language software maker to me... for $7.00 they sent the new F2 Fluenz French 1+2 discs PLUS access to all podcasts all in less than a week from my original email. I doubt Rosetta Stone would do that for their customers.
"I love this software, but acknowledge that this is a purely personal preference. I came across the software first as Reunion on the Mac, and was pleased to learn when I migrated to Windows that there is a Windows clone. Unfortunately the Reunion product has continued to evolve on the Mac while the Windows variant has stayed largely the same. All the same, the base product is great, and the support for customisable data, screens, reports and charts has kept me buying the software. After my last computer melt down I realised I had lost my installation disc and I couldn't find anyone who sold the software. I ultimately purchased this from a third party vendor via Amazon for just over $2 so the shipping was more expensive. The disc was in perfect condition when it arrived so the vendor was great. Happy to recommend this software to Genealogists everywhere."
"They do not provide any customer service with this product without a fee -a simple question as to how to print a borderless picture ?
Will never recommend their product or purchase in the future."
"This product seems to work well.  However, I just needed a populated copy of a 1040 and It will not populate the forms.  The software will not generate the 1040 at all at this point in time.  There is a summary but not the forms you would need to file or amend an return.  Don't waste your money it should be disclosed that the forms are no longer available."
"Windows 10 is the worst thing ever to happen to a computer. Gates should be hung for putting out such a product. Total invasion of a persons privacy. Hangs up on every task, nothing works. I'm building my own computer with Windows 7 Pro. That was an excellent OS."
I gave used turbo tax for over 10 years.  Nothing new or exciting it just goes thru the steps. Need a discount for upgrade year after year.
Picks up absolutely zero Malware ..... Have to use a free software to pick malware ..... Geeeeeze Louise
"I was able to solve the  Error message in Streets & Trips 2008 when you try to use Streets and Trips or MapPoint: ""Your registry settings for this application were not copied correctly""  I went to the application in C:\program files\microsoft streets and trips & trips\streets.exe.  right click properties, click on compatibility and check run as administrator  The program now works for me in Vista Premium."
"500 song limit to playlist; music comes & goes -- some music is available at some times then will randomly disappear & no longer be available.. just like what happens with Amazon Video... for being the wealthiest man of all times, one would think Amazon's founder & CEO would be able to offer a consistent product when it comes to music & movies..."
"I cant say much abou windows 7 coz I am not an expert. I just build my very first ever computer build just by watching youtube and internet forums. I hear windows 7 is the Operating system to get right now. Windows 8 is just more for colorful cosmetics. I am more of a gamer person. The seller was great, bought with product open box and the seller assured me that it will activate with no problems. very happy with the product and experience with this seller. would buy again."
Memeo Autobackup simply does not work properly.  It does not work as advertised.  I paid full price for the full version.  Backing up Outlook mail files are completely HIDDEN.  Found it anyway and turned it on and it STILL DIDN'T BACK IT UP!!!  Thousands of files selected for backup not backed up.  Customer Support / Tech Support is the worst in the world.  I had to take a whole day off of work to deal with them and them they wanted me to take a second whole day off of work because their products sucks.
"The software needed a technician to provide me with an update to file my state return.  The problem occurred because I use a Mac, even though the software was supposed to be compatible with my Mac."
I can't imagine doing my own income tax returns without it.  I was especially impressed with the feature for importing stock transactions from my brokerage house.  That was a huge time-saver.
"Received this item in a timely fashion. I have it loaded on my computer, but have not yet used it."
"never does my scheduled checks. I schedule them, but it doesn't do them"
"This software is crippleware, and at best it is a good DEMO version.  They should not be charging for this software.  I will not buy another broderbund program again, I really feel like I was given the shaft on this one."
"This item is advertised as compatible with the Windows platform, indicating it is computer software.  The item shipped is nothing but over-priced card board flash cards.  Zero stars would be appropriate."
It does a lot of things well.
I got this to help design a deck. I learned to draw by hand and I think I can lay it out by hand faster. I just need to take more time to learn how this CAD system works.
Just not what I wanted
Do not buy this it is a complete waste of money. Go buy a new reel instead.
Developer responded immediately to activation issue.  Initial impression of software is that it is well structured.  Reasonably priced for what appears to be efficient software focused on tracking inventory.
I was unable to use this. It did not install. I had to return it.
"I'd give it 5 stars if it would import MS4 work.

MS5 is easy to use right out of the box. To get really proficient, it takes about 2 weeks of playing around with different settings, trying out different things on different layers to see what it will do for you.  I love Photoshop, but all my digital artwork is going to be in MS5 from now on..."
"Product installed fine but there is a defective product validation process which Microsoft has not corrected. My computer, a brand new T5600 work station w/ Win 7 Ultimate, could not validate the product, and I had to spend multiple hours on the phone getting  help from website in India. After spending almost $400, I should not have to waste my time on a ridiculous validation process. Microsoft's product support is terrible. They treat every caller as a potential criminal who has stolen the product. I hope that Amazon will send a message to Microsoft about a defective software process that wastes everyone's time."
"This is an effective language learning program. most of the negative reviews revolved around the difficulty of the content, the lack of guidance or the ""unorganized"" interface. I feel the approach of this software is one of the best in its price range. lets face it, learning a language is difficult no matter what claims are made on the box! this program (like the name suggests) immerses you in spanish language. it's your job as a motivated student to find your way around (not unlike stepping of a plane in a foreign country) and in the process learn a good amount of spanish. yes, the video appears difficult at first but you can pause it at anytime and if you right click on any word you get a translation and pronuciation of the word. you can also click on the translation button and see the text in english as you hear it being spoken. there is even a control panel where you can change the difficulty level and the speed of dialog among other things. the grammar sections are comprehensive and there are plenty of exercises which relate to and reinforce the lessons. the interface and navigation bar lets you jump to any are of the program you want to work on. the exercises change depending on which lesson is selected and there is a progress screen where you can track your progress. if you supplement what you learn here with other stuff like watching your favorite dvd's with the spanish subtitles on or reading bilingual magazines you will really benefit from the solid foundation this software offers."
Windows 8 is the spawn of the devil.
much easier to use than the old version - has some new uses - format has changed a little - I like it
"I've used zonealarm for at least 3 years without issue until now.  I assisted a coworker with purchasing license for extreme security + pc tune-up.  The security suite installed & ran without issue; tune-up was a different story.

PC Tune-up installed but would not run; the application startup crashed with memory errors.  After contacting zonealarm support they indicated they don't support the app and I would have to contact Large software.  I contacted the Large software support line and the support person was politely condescedending at best.  She said they could fix the error but it was a ""premium service"" that would cost extra.  But she would be happy to provide an email to Large if I wanted to resolve through them.

She also insisted that everything I had done with the PC to this point so far was wrong and I had probably made matters worse.  There was something blocking the software from properly downloading she said but had no explanation on how the security suite downloaded, installed, and ran without issue.  I informed her that it is highly unusual to purchase an item off the shelf that doesn't work and then be charged to make it work.  What a creative way to generate sales for your tech support service.

If there was ever any reason to enact a software lemon law, zonealarm\pc tuneup\large software would be the reason for it."
"My almost five year old loves this game.  She needed help in the beginning figuring out the controls, but as time goes along she's learning more and more about the computer.  I worried that the gaming aspect would be over her head, but it isn't.  She follows the story quite well and there are plenty of other activities on this disk to keep a child going for a while.

Highly recommended for the Dora fan."
libreoffice is much better
This is my third Webroot disk.  It is the best anti-virus software I have ever found in 13 years of owing a PC.
"My existing Norton 360 account was due for renewal and I purchased this product on Amazon at a significant savings over Symantec's quoted renewal price.  After the purchase, the product and the product key were made available in my Amazon Software Library.  I copied the product key and used it to directly renew my current installation.  No need to download the whole program and reinstall it on top of my existing one.  Too easy and too good to be true.  I'm impressed and good for another 366 days."
works and our AV guys love it people show up with laptops and need to connect plus you can have a secondary monitor as an output (we use it for PowerPoint)
Have a small business and this has been very helpful.easy to use and navigate through.
Works great!
It work great for running Windows-only software on your Mac. Photography is my primary interest and a number of programs aren't Mac-friendly.
"We ordered and received a new Printmaster Version 18.  It came in the time period we were told it would and although we cannot use all three discs that come with it, (because our computer is too old) my friend is reaping the benefit of it.  Excellent company to order from."
"I bought this game because my 2 yr old loves Dora,thinking she
would grow into it but she fooled me. She easily mastered level
one and two. It is a good game,holds her attention but not for any
long amounts of time. I gave it an average rating because levels
could be a little more challenging."
great pc program
"My review is plain and simple: Microsoft Office 2007 is a pain.  I hate it.

Unfortunately, Microsoft Office software designers decided to redesign the look entirely, and the result is forcing users everywhere to completely relearn the entire software.  They tried to make the options more ""user-friendly"", but for someone who is wanting to do more advanced documents, creation time is at least doubled.  I'm not sure what the problem with the old software was, but they should consider reverting 2007 to a format more like Office 2003."
"This security is bad! It slowed everything down, I got NO tech support when I asked, and it was a little difficult to install; 3 tries. I got the free ones and am MUCH happier!"
Very helpful program
go with intuit
"After all these years, I do have to wonder why Intuit hasn't addressed the problems with its software QA, and continues to ship fairly buggy new releases. As usual. the new release is a small incremental ""dot release"", and I think that it's high time that Intuit introduced registered user upgrade pricing (NOT the piddling discount each year, which is still more expensive than buying the full version at Costco). No big issues, and the release is mostly a big yawn."
Full of details and all the information I needed to fix my can-am !!!
"Great games to play when you are stuck indoors or just plain bored. Great selection of games.
Just plain fun,"
"there are a couple of you that simply based upon what you have said need to stop trying so hard to sound like you know computers.  ljws from Memphis and ""annonymous"" from San Jose for example.  Just a hint, reading PC World does not make you an expert.  (I cannot believe I'm defending Windows)"
"First and foremost this DOES NOT allow a upgrade from Windows 7.  It does allow you to keep all your data but does wipe out your applications so if there is a program you can't live without and can't find the original disks you have a BIG decision to make.  I would suggest you put all self generated files, e.g., documents on an external drive and then disconnect the drive just in case.

Shortly after the installation the OS did a critical update so when I came back to my computer it was done.  Note:  I did an 8.0 to  8.1 upgrade on my Surface pro the day before as a downloaded upgrade.  The results were not stellar to say the least.  On the tablet I had to remove the update because it wiped out the wifi connection and I tried everything I knew to restore it.  Once I backed off the update it worked just fine.  On the desktop (New Dell that came native with 8 on it) I began getting error messages saying that my IE browser was an old version of Netscape and it was incompatible.  The solution I found was to install the newest version of Fire Fox which seems to fixed the problem.  It appears that some vendors are not as compatible as they thought they were and MS has some work to do.

So In my estimation 8.1:
1.  Has some bugs that need to be addressed
2.  Is faster than 7 was
3.  Has a smaller learning curve
4.  Has some compatibility issues
5.  Needs to allow drive indexing for external drives to speed up the seek time
5. Needs MS attention to fix the glitches pronto if they want to gain in their market share."
Works as good as iTunes - Love it!!!
Stopped working after a few weeks
Great software.
"Have been using it for many years; but, this is my last year. Using the deluxe version met all my needs until this year. I was required to get a $30.00 upgrade for ONE PAGE stock loss carry over."
"Terrible, might be easy for a beginner, but you cannot import standard formats (like html) to edit, or improve. There are free ones about, and many a lot cheaper that work better."
"McAffee TPU 2016 is a solid Anti-Virus with some other good options. I used McAffee AV last year as i was given a free year code, the installation upgrade from 2015 to 2016 was effortless. This product (at least when bough from Amazon) is the cheapest AV you can buy with unlimited devices. The vulnerability finder is nice for maintaining updates on software though the install option doesn't always work it at least lets you know a program update was found. I have also installed McAffee on my Android phone and found the battery consumption no higher than before.

All Around I think this is the best deal this year for and Anti Virus"
"This is the first item, in years of order from Amazon, that I have ever returned (the return process with Amazon, btw, is wonderful!).  The GPS with this software is very good, it gets a signal quickly, and is very accurate.  It does not (which is what led to my returning the item) however, work well with other software.  There's an application that you have to load to make the GPS appear in software like Steets & Trips (it converts the USB signal to a COM port) which is more hassle then I wanted to deal with.

The software, however, is HORRIBLE.  I can't express in words how bad this software is.  I work in IT for a living, and I work with many different software packages every day.  I spent about 16 hours working with the software, trying to learn how it ""did"" things, and working around it's issues.  I was trying to plan an upcoming trip to Yellowstone; none of the points of interest were hitting; I was entering GPS coordinates for the hotels I'm staying in, and the overall process (planning a single trip, 7 waypoints) took almost 4 hours.  It was just horribly complicated, and incredibly frustrating.  After going through that disaster, I decided to try a competing product, Streets and Trips 2009 (free download available).

Using S&T, I planned the entire trip in about 30 minutes.  EVERY single hotel I'm staying in was immediately picked up; the longest part of the process was figuring out how to tell the software that I was stopping in a location for the evening.  It was SO much better then this product's software that I purchased another GPS (Hulox M1000) and decided to send this one back.  I realized that, even if I did eventually learn the software, my co-pilot (girlfriend) would never figure it out, and she'd hate me forever for making her try.

This software is so poor it shouldn't even be sold; I've used alpha software that's more refined and easier to use.  The GPS is great, but if you want to use it with another product, you will HAVE to use the serial port emulator (a deal breaker for me), another piece of software to load on your mapping computer.

I realize that some people like the Street Atlas interface; but, trust me, if you've never used mapping software before, you will absolutely hate it; it reminds me of a DOS program that's been ported to Windows."
Excellent quality. Thank you.
"WORKS GREAT,HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THIS EASY TO DO, WOULD SUGGEST TO ANYONE TO GET IT WELL WORTH THE PRICE"
"It's been difficult to install, difficult to work with. It's slow and I feel like I'm going to break it if I click the wrong thing.

The UI doesn't match modern versions of Windows or even XP. The drop downs appear on the wrong monitor if you are using multiple monitors.

The only redeeming quality I've found so far is that there is an importer that manages to barely work somehow. I enter all my time with Excel and save it as a .csv and then run it through the importer.

Oh and good luck trying to access the database over any kind of VPN."
"Same exact program as when I was little in the early 90's. Brings back sweet memories of listening to my cassettes back in the day.  My only issue was with the sound; the recording was  hard to hear on some of the episodes. The speaker would be quiet,  so i turned it up to hear and then got blasted out when the organ music played all of a sudden.  But despite that,  it's a great buy and good quality. Worth every penny."
"This could have been self inflicted but the descriptions say it includes the state filing. The $34.94 version I downloaded did not include the state which cost an additional $34.95. The software now list for $21.45, so I'm unhappy about that also.  The software worked good and retrieved last year's Tubro Tax fine.  You do have to click on some items that weren't explained very clearly.  I will use it again next year but I will wait for the price to drop."
I was unable to use office suite because it did not come with the pass word numbers to down load the complete program i sent it back and they have not credited me as  of yet.
This is a very comprehensive language lesson plan that works with tons of practice. I've used it in conjunction with an audio lesson (while walking) and a classroom setting. The 3-way method is very effective.
"I've used CorelDRAW for many years - since version 3. I used it as a desktop publisher and a typesetter and to create architectural shop drawings. These days, I use it to create graphics that I can import into embroidery digitizing programs to create custom embroidery designs.

The reason it's so wonderful is that it created graphics in a vector-based format. Vector based graphics are different than, say, bitmaps because they are infinitely re-sizeable without any loss of resolution. Vector images are mathematical descriptions of the image, which is exactly the same at any size. Bitmaps, on the other hand, are composed of an exact number of pixels so they suffer greatly when sized up - jagged edges and loss of sharpness.

Corel offers an incredibly full-featured graphics suite so that almost anything you need to create, edit, or produce can be done comepletely within the product. It includes an extensive font library and stock images, artwork, backgrounds, symbols and template galleries that are spectacular for business applications as well as individual users.

The suite includes several programs - CorelDRAW x7, Capture x7, Power Trace x7, Photo-Paint x7, Connect x7, Website Creator and Bitstream Font Navigator. (You must download Website Creator from the Corel website after you install and register CorelDRAW x7 and set up an account. The account gives you access to updates and all sorts of extra help, tutorials, community discussions as well as other downloads.

Inside the box is the install disk and a quick reference card. (The registration key is located in the plastic disc case behind the disk.) Unlike early versions, there are no printed instruction manuals and font/clip art catalogs. Instead, the almost 700 page users guide is on Corel's site and can be downloaded to your computer. There are also over 5 hours of tutorial videos included with the program that allows even complete novices to begin using this software with confidence.

Installation went smoothly for me. Note: The EULA only allows you to have this software installed on one computer at any time.

Besides the software, there are 1,000, high-quality, OpenType fonts, 800 background patterns and frames, more than 10,000 pieces of clip art, 2000 stock digital photos, 2,000 vehicle templates and 350 templates.

I have recommended CorelDraw for many years now and x7 doesn't disappoint."
"I've been using AutoCAD off and on since it was a DOS program and it has continued to improve in ease of operation with each subsequent release that I've used from AutoCAD11 to the present. they haven't all been huge jumps in quality, but it has been at least a slight improvement with each one. I guess the only complaint I might have with this release is that the instruction manual might have gone into more depth; some one who is going to be using AutoCAD for the first time might still be lost with some of their explanations and examples, but then I suppose that's what all those aftermarket AutoCAD manuals are for."
Has a lot of capabilities but very akward to use.  Not much in the way of instructional information.  Very slow and difficult to navigate.  I would not buy it again.
"I've been using SmartDraw for over 12 years, and without a doubt this new edition is the easiest-to-use yet most powerful software program I've ever used. The visual processor analogy (SmartDraw, the world's first visual processor, is to visuals what a word processor is to text) really makes sense once you use this software.

It really helps to do what we all want to do - communicate with visuals in our everyday life. You can make process charts (flow charts) to better manage processes, Gantt charts to manage projects, mind maps to brainstorm and organize thoughts, to-do lists, almost anything. It has great starter templates and thousands of examples. Whenever I'm not sure what kind of visual to use, or how to communicate something, I browse the many categories and almost always find something that perfectly fits what I'm trying to accomplish.

SmartDraw is super intuitive, and so automated it's simply amazing."
"Love this app.  Works great on PC, Phone, Table et al."
"I've been using this software for years, it works well.  I wish our tax code was simplified so I didn't need it.  Oh well..."
great deal
Kaspersky what a great piece of software.
Does what its supposed to fairly well.  I need to spend more time exploring and learning.
Invalid product key #... could NOT download and Microsoft said it was an invalid code.  I want my $ back
I am satisfied with this software so far. I am not sure which anti virusu software is better although I changed ESET to Kaspersky.
"I'm a QB Proadvisor.
Gray on black with no ability to change scheme or font is an absolute deal killer for me.
And I've recommended to all of my clients to avoid or wait on QB 2013 until Intuit puts back the color and font customizations.
Yes, there are some great new features in 2013.
The lack of color and headaches caused using the product aren't worth it."
This software is terribly slow.  It is so slow that it is not usable.  Amazon also will not refund my money for this worthless software.  Do not buy this or any other software from amazon.
"I was very satisfied with Money 99 and purchased Money 2002 with the hopes of a similar experience.  Unfortunately, the program never worked properly on my computer which runs Windows 98 version 1. I could only load the program from the Taskbar as the Desktop Icon and Start Menu selection would not work.  Additionally, during installation an updated Internet Explorer was installed.  Afterwards, I experienced numerous lock-ups while on the internet and eventually my computer crashed and would not reboot.  After reinstalling my operating system I installed Money 2002 fresh without my backup data.  This time similar problems but now there was no icon on the Taskbar and absolutely no way to load the program.  I'm now back to using Money 99 and my computer is again operating smoothly."
"Probably too early to write about the total pros and cons of the software, but so far it's been a good experience.

I was a little surprised at the amount of time it took to install the actual software.  Maybe I have warpped expectations.  But the time was the only installation issue.  Forced restarts are kind of part of the deal and wasn't a huge issue for me.

My PowerBook G4 is a bit newer, so unlike others who have older Apple models, I don't think the upgrades are as jarring for me.

Spotlight is nice.  Quick and efficient.  And unlike some detractors, those who use do have a lot of files, it is just an easier way to locate them than utilizing Finder.

The Dashboard function is very cool and is something I will use often.  The weather and iTunes ones especially.  But the ability to have a number of additional widget downloads is nice - for blogging or what have you.  Many of them are very area specific, but still could be plenty useful.

I feel a little better that I got a $50 instant rebate for Tiger.  I feel I got a bargain for an upgrade.  Probably worth it for full price especially if you had an older OS on your Mac."
"I've just finished Lesson 1 so far, which taught me a few things that I didn't know after years of using Excel. I like the instructor's teaching methods and being able to proceed at my own pace. I've taken some full and half day sessions before that jam so much into a short period of time that I did't retain anything. Also I've not been able to fit any more extensive classes at local community college into my busy schedule, and they were more expensive than this. I expect to learn many advanced skills in the subsequent lessons that will be a great help in my current job."
"Where do I start? The user interface is extremely complicated (and I am in IT!). It is very difficult to know how to get to your music vs prime music vs  well, whatever else Amazon calls it this week. And if you search for songs, they show up as a grid, but you have no idea how to play them.

BUT, the worst thing is that this app EATS ALL THE CPU RESOURCES of my system. I am on a pretty robust 64-bit, Win 7 box with 20 gigs of RAM and quad-core i7 processors and it makes everything lag. Maybe it is scanning my system for songs to add to my library? I don't know. But it is horrible. I have turned it off and have just fired-up ITunes to play my local music.  Thank goodness I did not pay for this app."
"Update March 14, 2016:  The annoying feature I orginally complained about appears to have been fixed in Release 5.  Adding a star for listening and acting on customer feedback.

Upgraded from Q2013 without any issues.  Validated the data file (43MB from many years of use) using Q2013 before installing the upgrade.  I don't use mobile or cloud features so I can't comment on that functionality.  Unfortunately there's a new ""feature"" where a pop-up window appears every time I add a bill reminder prompting me to link it to an online bill.  I don't use and don't plan to use the online bills, but there doesn't appear to be any way to turn off these prompts.  Very annoying - cost them a star.  Otherwise, no surprises in this extremely useful application."
I ordered this way before I needed it and was had no problem installing it.  I have used Norton for years and have never had any issues.  Would order again if the price was right.
I can't even use it. I can't use it in class. It doesn't even have all 13 chapters it only has 9.
"This is a great anti-virus program for 3 computers and it works well with laptops, desktops and netbooks which lasts for one year.  It has been installed for over a month and no problems have developed."
I just replaced Dragon 13 NaturallySpeaking professional with version 12.5. I had to downgrade because there are just too many applications that Dragon 13 refuses to interact with as Dragon 12 did. Dragon 13 performs well for general dictation.
it did not work..the main character was right-side up but the background was up-side down.
"daily deal price, love Norton products would always wait for daily deal close to when you need tor renew never pay full price"
"Ubuntu is nice, but there are some ""buts"".
Some systems, or parts of systems, are not immediately supported. A brand new computer sometimes will not run Ubuntu Linux.
Ubuntu is a definite better option compared to upgrading to Vista!
I think Linux Mint is superior, it is basically Ubuntu with a few ""extras"" which make the computer funcionally more complete right after the install. Ubuntu requires DSL or faster to get everything onto your computer.
I enjoy using Ubuntu. I recommend it to everyone who is running XP.
The preferred course would be just buying an iMac, but you may want to keep using your XP box or laptop for a while. Ubuntu will keep it going for years more."
"I just purchased this software based on the reviews, but no matter what I did I could not get it to work on my computer.  I did everything support websites advised, and nothing worked.  I think this software is for six year old computers and systems, not updated ones."
"This review is of the HD01 host card and matching PD01 desktop portal. Since they operate together I am writing the same review for both but have broken it into two sections.

The host card plugs into the x1 PCIe slot and uses a long heatsink instead of a fan for cooling. The supplied dual DVI cable plugs into the DVI output of the video card. The other connector on the card is the ethernet cable over which the USB, video and audio information is sent. The supplied ethernet cable connects to the network switch.

The Desktop Portal is silent (no fan or hard disk) and provides the connections for the keyboard, mouse, mic, headphones and local USB devices. It also supports up to two monitors via DVI cables, and to the network switch via a standard ethernet cable. Overall 3 network ports and IP numbers are used (one for the ethernet connector on the computer, one for the host card and one for the portal)

With everything connected and powered up the portal and card found each other and connected without issue using DHCP assigned IP numbers. Out of the box in less than 30 minutes I had moved my desktop PC to the utility closet and now have a silent workstation in my home office! Neither normal usage, nor watching a 1080 video (such as elephantsdream.org) showed any signs of delay, packet loss or compression."
Quickbooks has been very helpful. We were able to expedite our billing and payroll  process. Would recommend this for any business large or small.
"Love Amazon Prime Music!  Wide selection of music, many genres available, many current hits as well."
"I write a lot of papers for school and when I upgraded to a new computer, I found that my MS Office license wasn't transferable.  I was offered this product to try and...well, it works fine.  It takes a little getting used to because of the interface being different but my papers get printed and delivered just like I do it in Word, and my spreadsheets look great.  I also have not found any problems opening Word or Excel documents with this program.  Since I'm not using it in an office environment, I can't review the other special features involved but I have to assume that they will work fine if I ever need them.
Overall, I like the product and would highly recommend it to anyone needing an office suite of sorts."
did not work well
Not much has changed just a few new cards.
"I was very disappointed in the change in the product.  I have used TurboTax Deluxe for at least 15 years and I ordered it this year as usual just to find out after I received it that you can't do a Schedule C for sole proprietor.  I then had to go to the trouble of returning it and ordering the Premier Home and Business version, which cost more. I'm seriously going to look at using a different company next tax year.  I have been a loyal TurboTax customer for so long, but I feel like they have not been loyal to me!"
The Learn Microsoft Office 2010 and 2007 & Windows 7 - 48 Hours of Video Training is very informative. I am looking forward to continue using this information.
"Want an app that allows you to perform quickly and at peak performance?

good
"If you have a brand new computer - this could be a nice product?

I installed this product with a computer that is around 4-5 yrs old- only to have it shut down. I did get free tech help & started in safe mode & shut down again. At that point, I was instructed to ""take to Computer tech"" & I did.

$156.00 later, I had my computer back ( functioning ) & the problem was the software. My computer store ""have recieved others with this same problem."" Never will buy ANY computer related equipment related to this company again.

Wrote Amazon & didn't get an apology or good morning etc./.....

Like I said- Buyer Beware- if unsure , call you ISP handler or a computer tech.

tnrthoma"
Works verydood.
good antivirus :)
"I downloaded this item, received the activation code, after several hours of download time.  I have entered the activation code several times and it will not activate.

I strongly advise against downloading this product, buying the software would be much preferable.

I want a refund, but cannot contact anyone to give me one, I will gladly delete it from my computer since it is usless without the code."
Got the job done on time.
"Once I finally received the upgrade (how long it took to get here is another story).  I found it easy to install, and I like the new look.  It will take a little getting used to, but I have always found that Microsoft makes many improvements each time they issue an upgrade."
I have been sitting with this Sony product now for over a week and I have tried every which way to install it but it will not install. I am using Windows XP and an HP 3500+ computer. I have never before had problems installing software even though I am not a computer fundi but this version of Vegas is not only a riddle but it is unusable. I have written about 6 emails to Sony and have received 3 replies after about 3 or 4 days and each reply gave the same standard answer. It referred me to an answered question in the frequently asked question section on the Sony site about not being able to install the software. I had already seen that answer and it did not work. I tried it again and again but still no installation. Even while trying to install you have a choice on creating short cuts on your desktop for the software...guess what?...there were no short cuts created. I had switched off all my Norton stuff etc and it did not help. I am very disappointed as this is my first time in the movie area of software. I will call Amazon and see if there is something they can do for me as to my getting something that actually works rather than this hopeless product.
"Under the gun to get a nice Christmas MP3 for a gathering that evening,  I paid $10 for an Amy Hite Classical Guitar (very nice)  but when I went to download it the process was so complicated that to this writing, I have yet to figure it out.  I think it has something to do with having to purchasing a yearly music downloading account or something  (I'm not going there).  I did receive the music CD, it's  stuck in some sort of Amazon cloud where I'm unable to move the files.  I  needed  to download and transfer the files to I-tunes, so that I could update my I-pod, this did not happen via. amazons download process. I ended up going to another music site (paying another $10 for the MP3 download) then loading the files into I-tunes  (too simple). Thank you Amazon for nothing , your cloud somehow ate my CD."
This antivirius has slowed down my computer so much that I think I will be deleting it.
So Easy!
"we completed half our return and important brokerage account info, and now we cannot get the program to open on our Mac at all - tried rebooting; keep getting an error message... UPDATE as of 3/25 - managed to get the return to open by clicking on the file via Downloads - documents - file. T15 instead of clicking from the top row of menu options in HRBlock (File-open saved file).  Subsequently, we have been able to open the HRBlock software the normal way; don't know what has changed.  Very quirky software this year.  I hope we don't run into trouble when we try to submit the final return."
"I have never actually made a scrapbook before, but always wanted to do one to save some family memories in a more interesting way. So when I heard about this product for the Mac I decided to give it a try.

I really like it. Although I am used to more sophisticated design software like Quark Xpress and Indesign, I found this software to be elegant in its simplicity. There are a few things I would like to see added to the product but on the whole it was easy to learn and use. I especially like the way you can export your finished pages as jpgs and import them into iPhoto, from there I created a book and had Apple send me the finished printed hardcover. All without leaving my home."
Will not fit in with Overdrive at the Charlotte Mecklenburg public library eBooks online.
great product
I am very pleased with the QuickBooks 2008 that I purchased. The package came quickly and was exactly what I ordered. Thank you!
I've used this software for years & Tax Cut. Was always a good investment with accuracy & ease of calculations. The one day special was too good not to download. Would do it again next year.
"I can't say enough of this software. My children are in grade 1 now and love the game. Its has three levels , and the games are based on normal life activities. It is very educational  but fun at the same time. My child was having a bit of difficulties counting in 10 , but that's over now thanks to this software. They practice what they learn at school , and the best of all is that it  makes them love math even more which is  the whole point ."
"I have already purchased my payroll renewal for this year. However, now I have to upgrade to QB2016. Will my renewal transfer over once I install QB2016?"
"I've struggled through Windows defragging and disc cleanup with minimal results for the time involved.  Also tried ""free"" cleanup products only to find that only the analysis, not the cleanup, was free.  So I decided to take a chance on Win Cleaner One-Click in spite of its price.  Tried it first on my desktop which runs on Windows XP.  Installation was far easier than the directions implied.  In a manner of minutes all problems were analysed and solved.  The change in speed of operations was immediately apparent.  The same thing happened when I installed Win Cleaner on my laptop, which runs on Windows Vista.  Installation was easier than expected, registration was quick and easy.  Running the programme again required only a few minutes to analyse and solve the problems.  Again, an immediate increase in operating speed was notised.  I can't find enough good things to say about this product and recommend it highly every one, whether student, home, or business user."
"With one kid in college and the other in middle school, products like this saved us a great deal of cash. we were able to load this onto each kid's laptop and then put the third version on our home desktop for their use... what does that save us, about $500!! Yep, good deal."
Great for people that have gone though the talk now! course and are ready for a more advanced understanding of the Icelandic Language.
Doesn't tell you how to get anywhere when used with a GPS...simply shows you where you are.  Nothing more than a glorified paper map.  A complete embarassment!
Doesn't work.
Love love love Amazon Prime music.
"I got this for an older gentleman who is starting to use computers. He was able to teach himself how to type with this program. I got him started with it, but over the next couple of weeks he completed the exercises by himself. I say this to attest to the ease of use/user friendly capabilities of this program. I recommend paying the extra $10-20 for this program that is affective and easy to use."
"The good news is that transitioning data was seamless. The bad news is that I'm getting a glitch where I have to ""Run as Administrator"" and then get an error message that Quicken doesn't support ""Run as Administrator"". But I just ignore the message and have the functionality I need.

As for Amazon, you saved me money of Quicken's own ""Sale"" price!"
upgrade to 2009. very much used and liked.
Love it!
"For about 7 months, I've been running this software on my Vista home premium laptop and my XP Media Center desktop and haven't had any problems at all.  Both of my systems operate smoothly, even during full system scans. I've used a few different internet security suites and so far this is the best.  I only gave it 4 stars because the extra features (Duplicate finder, disk defragmenter) are mediocre.
Pros: Easy to use/configure, Updates every hour, not a resource hog.
Cons: Seems like some extra features were just added as fillers."
"08-02-2017. Installed the App in OSX, double clicked on it...nothing happened. I figured out it might be missing Java runtime. Installed the runtime...still doesnt open. I see two process running for it. Tried killing them and starting them again...nothing at all.

This is a serious lack of Customer Obsession and poor QA."
"its ok, I don[t know how to get it running to use it.  I probably just need to play with it and I will love it"
"I had a much simpler version of CAD from this company previously.  It was easy to use.  I'm sure this is great software, but the product description is a little misleading.  It says ""easy to use, perfect for novice designers"".  I'm pretty good around a pc and figuring out new software (above average for sure).  But unless you have taken actual CAD drafting classes, I would not say this is easy to use.  I will get it figured out eventually, but it will take several hours of trial and error.  Also, the download doesn't come with any tutorials that I could find."
Very intuitive and easy to review
"Great, user friendly, does the job, and I do recommend it."
I bought Rosseta Stone Levels 1&2- the homeschool edition for my daughter who is going into the 9th grade. She Loves using it and looks forward to using it everyday. She thinks it is a great way to learn how to speak Spanish. I recomend this project to EVERYONE!
Can't go wrong with Freddi Fish!  Kids love Freddi!

Just wasted my money. Not available for my region when I try and use. What the ....
"I just finished playing this game with my 4 year old son and I must say that neither of us found this title to be even remotely entertaining.  It lacks the depth, superb graphics, and variety of the VERY good dinosaur game - Dinosaur Adventure 3-D.  The entire game is this simple:  Match 3 dinosaur tiles (head, mid-section, and tail) before your opponent does... and do it again, and again, and again...  I didn't play it with my son for more than 20 minutes before I gave up from sheer boredom.  I would suggest spending your money on Dinosaur Adventure 3-D instead."
I had a really old version of Quicken on a old computer that went bad and this was the first thing I wanted on the new computer. It is quite different than what I was using so I am still getting used to it.
Best typing program EVER. Too bad it's hard to use on more recent versions of Windows :(
"I totally agree with the other 2 posts. Intuit is incredibly greedy when it comes to the payroll services and customer service is totally useless. In the past 20 years of using Quickbooks, I have found the program easy to use and payroll was reasonable in cost until about 6 years ago. Instead of renewing through Intuit, I would wait till my yearly payroll expired, than buy it for half the price at any office store or Costco. Even then, I could not activate my subscription without calling customer service to activate the disk I purchased or a download. It is now less expensive to use my accountant than Quickbooks Payroll. I am earnestly looking at other products to switch to. Buyer beware !!"
"If you want to really study GOD'S word, this is the best bible selection that I have Found."
"I've owned every version of this product thru v7. I find it easier to use than the other editors that I have tried. Tools are where I expect them to be and the toolbars are very intuitive. I love it. I had a little trouble with my version, very early, installing it on my XP system."
"I needed a program that would print labels. The word processing program installed on my computer just would not print labels. I found this EZ Home & Office software on-line. I am so happy that I did. The program will do more then just print labels and I love the way you can sort the labels. It's easy to use and the support for the program is wonderful. The only tiny problem I have with it is that it won't print envelopes. This has only happened once or twice with other users so it's something peculiar to my printer. I would not let this stop me from purchasing this program again. It is a wonderful program and I am very happy that I have it. Elwood Software is great to work with and gives excellent support. If you are looking for label printing software, give this one a try. I don't think you will regret it."
love it
Need to take tome to really learn it but it's a great product. Some things seem a little redundant.
Disable any firewalls and download Amazon software program
"I'm updating from Windows XP, not so much because I really want to, but due to the dropped support for XP. Honestly, it was time. I backed up a few hundred GB of pictures, game files, emails, documents and music to an external drive before I ever started because I didn't want to take any chances. I deleted the three partitions of my hard drive and went for a fresh install in a single partition. The install time was remarkably fast compared to my previous experience with Win98, Win2K, and WinXP. I've done one Win7 install for a friend and I don't remember it being this fast either. Running on default drivers was a much better experience than XP as well. I updated video, audio and LAN drivers because of features my hardware offer, but I was running with network access as soon as Win8.1 was up.

The interface is different, but I knew it would be. I've had a few minor adjustments to make in my expectations but most of the features of the new interface are easily avoided and ignored once you figure them out. I know there has been much to do about the unified touch-screen-friendly look, but I really think that most of the negative response is over-wrought and undeserved. Most people have learned to use the interface on their phones and their tablets and most people are able adaptable enough to learn a few new tricks.

My only grumble was the requirement to sign up for a Microsoft account during setup. Great. Another user name and password to remember. I understand the concept; indeed I love on my Android devices that I'm able to share apps and setting across multiple devices and environments. But there it is- my small gripe of annoyance.

As I type this my PC is at home re-installing all my Steam games so I've yet to experience the not-too-small bonus of a current version of DirectX. Another bonus- this is my first 64 bit OS."
"Having been (and still am) a DIY enthusiast for decades, I began using Broderbund's Interior Design software way back in 1995, loved it, and a couple of years later I came across Punch design software. It did an admirable job, and I continued with their software up until my very recent download of Chief Architect Suite 2014. (As an aside, I also want to state here that I have used AutoCad/Mechanical Desktop for mechanical engineering design work for years too, but obviously that software could only be used at work!)

Back to this product: It took a bit of getting used to in creating 3-D views (which reminded me of the Broderbund product in that regard). However, my biggest problem was that I was unable to get 90% of the textures to SHOW in my 3-D rendered views. I browsed their forum, and noticed that many others were having the same ""white furniture/objects"" problem, and the blame went to ""graphics card problem"". I wrote to the company and they suggested a refund. I ""sat on it"" for a day or so, and went back on in to the program. I did NOT want to give it up as I ""liked it too much"".

The reason for my review's title of five stars and the refund comment is this: I SOLVED the ""white furniture/object"" problem quite accidentally. I was using the render option to view my finished room layout, and noticed in the drop down menu the last option to 'toggle textures'. Hmm, I wonder... and YES, *that* was my problem all along. I kick myself for not having seen it sooner, as I wasted hours of frustrated tinkering - wavering from ""get a refund"" to ""I wish it would work"". Sigh.

I wanted it to work because what I ""could"" see of the rendering in 3-D was superb - baseboards and crown moldings, EXCELLENT cabinet placement, whereby corner cabinet counter tops ""automagically"" fill in the missing space when two corner cabinets are properly aligned either side by side or angled - and the counter top is still editable for a different choice of granite, or say, marble (and the cabinets color/material can be changed too).

Another very nice feature (over Punch) is when you do a door cut-out - i.e. a ""doorway"" with no casing. The baseboard ACTUALLY WRAPS around the wall's thickness. In Punch, there's nothing there to cover the wall's thickness... just sharp cut-off baseboard edges at the back and the front of the wall... so KUDOS to Chief Architect for giving me properly wrapped baseboards!

Also, I love the accuracy of the wall's thicknesses - and choices - anywhere from standard 2x4 studs, to 2x6 - all the way to CBS or poured concrete walls! WOW!

I also like the choice of ""style"" when you first start a new plan. I have used ""cottage"" theme, and ""traditional"" already. In both cases, the doors and baseboards are styled to fit the theme. Cottage gave me bead board cabinets and such, painted in white. In Traditional, the doors were of dark wood. Why is this good? Back in my Punch days, the baseboards and doors and windows were always of a light wood, and if you wanted them to be painted white, you had to painstakingly select them and add the styling. That's not to say you can't or won't change the colors of window frames/doors etc in your chosen theme using this software, but it's very handy when baseboards/crown/window frames are already the color you want! I spend too much time using these programs as it is (ask my husband!!! he says it's a sickness with me) - so any time I can save NOT having to do tedious painting of baseboards throughout, is just FINE with me!

Their texture/color library is excellent too (plus you can download ""brand name"" furniture groupings and the like, for free. (Some you have to pay for IF you have a more expensive version of this software). I actually can put LEATHER on my couches now! And there's an abundance of different types of glass: block, stained, opaque, clear - for instance. I also love the smoothness of their rendered bathtubs! The Punch version was awful compared to this software (but then again, I'm running this on a brand new Win8 PC with upgraded memory etc. but with the standard video card).

The program seems to be smart enough to know that when you paint one wall a certain color, you don't have to fiddle around ""breaking"" a long (interior or exterior) wall, so that you can have different wall colors and/or tile/textures in rooms on either side of the perpendicular wall.

Another reason I chose this software was due to my having a newly purchased Win8 PC, as mentioned. Also - THE PRICE of this software is unbeatable.

There's much much much more about this program that I like, but right now this review is turning into a book. Sorry about that. If you've never used house design software before, I hope my review will help you in your purchasing decision. I won't say it's been the easiest to learn (as many other reviewers have stated) but then again, neither was Mechanical Desktop a walk in the park either, learning-wise!

As another reviewer stated, it's GREAT for furniture arranging -  no more aching backs ""seeing if something looks right"" and then changing your mind... do it on the PC screen first, then call in your buddies for a furniture-moving party!

If you're as bad as me, (some 400+ plans created over the past 17 years) then I highly recommend using this product to get those designs out of your head and into 3-D form.

Cheers,
Susan Gast"
WORKED..
I've used Quicken for many years and it continues to get more intuitive with each upgrade. I love using it to manage my money. The only reason I did not rate a full 5 stars is that some of my accounts to not automatically download with One Step Update. I'm wondering if it is on my bank's end though.
The license worked well and authenticated with no issues.
"Majority of the instruments are flat sounding, the percussion that is supposed to be present within the program never actually sounds as it should except when inputting it, and if you are trying to place chords within it that differ in rhythm it is horrendous. I really wish i did more studying into this software before purchasing it. For the price you are spending on it the crappy quality should definitely be expected. I only thought it was so cheap due to it being a not so highly recognized composition software, now I know it is because most of the instruments and the overall look of the printed sheets are garbage. What makes things worse is that when and if you have issues with the software their customer service is just as bad. There is no phone number to call directly to help, no direct email to get in touch with anybody, and no form of instant messaging. You have to submit for help in this very generic emailing platform and their response times are either very vague or extremely lagged. Definitely saving up to get me something way better."
"This is perfect,

Ordered one for a lot cheaper prior but the code only worked for 3 months till it stoped and said i need to activate windows again. This is directly from amazon and can be trusted. Dont trust anything else like I did. Big mistake...."
Really please with the tax program. Have used every year since 2001. The program is easy to use and I would recommend to others.
I am 47 & learning the language of my grandparents & I highly recommend this computer CD. Easy to get around & easy to learn from. Kudos to this company for such a usefull product.
Love it
"for the price this Nero classic works fine,just what I needed WS CARTER"
My husband got me this for Christmas as I've always dreamed of creating my own animation. I've watched many tutorials on YouTube that made creating your own Animation look so easy. But I've been tinkering with this software for about a week or two and I'm completely frustrated. It's hard to figure out and understand even though there are so many tutorials out there and the .pdf tutorial that is included with this tells you how. I can't seem to get the bones right to make the animation movements flow. It's definitely not a software you'd want to gift to a young kid unless they are very computer savvy and easily understand things. It has surely frustrated me on many occasions ! But it is fun and most likely more fun when you figure how everything comes together and works. I might recommend it but I definitely recommend a high amount of patience and persistence to go with this.
Works good
it works
"We purchased ""JumpStart Kindergarten"" for our son about 8 months ago. It was a solid product from which he enjoyed learning. This new ""Advanced"" version is even better than the original!
Game layout is improved, as are the animated characters. Whereas the original featured mostly ""Hopsalot,"" the Advanced version features more of the JumpStart characters (six in total). The incentive for learners to keep playing (outside of the fact that the learning activities really are FUN!) is the chance to ""build"" a customized bumper car and enter a contest to collect the most special objects.
Features include the progress report, and a new and neat assessment test. First-time users take the assessment test, and have the option of letting the computer set the difficulty level for the learning activities, or they are allowed to set them manually.
Like other JumpStart titles, users enter a treehouse which serves as a schoolhouse. Inside the treehouse, there are three characters (learning stations), each focusing on a different subject (reading, music, and art). When exiting the treehouse to the back of the school, users meet three other characters (learning stations): spelling and phonics, addition and subtraction, and patterns and sizes.
Users click on a character to enter that particular learning area. Successful answers are counted and tracked by character-specific objects (bows, bubbles, flags, musical note, etc.). After collecting 4 of the objects, a carrot is awarded and tracked with the on-screen bushel basket. After earning 10 carrots, users ""soup-up"" their bumper cars, and ""unlock"" a new competition area. In the competition area, users compete against the computer, or another player, and try to collect the most track-specific objects (candy, sea shells, etc.). The user collecting the most gets his/her ""picture"" in the ""newspaper.""
Catchy music, good animation, characters that aren't too cheesy (although the female elephant's voice may annoy some), TERRIFIC learning activities, and a fun game to encourage working with the learning activities all add up to a great addition to your youngster's software collection."
"People, it took for me at least two weeks of struggle with brand new Pentium i7 3.4 GHz on fresh Win 10 Pro w/ 16 GB RAM .. to understand that System Mechanic just a cr..p which instead of doing what it should (fixing registry etc) - doing something else.

Since i purchased this absolute junk software, my Lenovo degraded its performance daily. A few days ago i thought that i fixed problem but this problem progressed and appeared again. Ya .. System Mechanic shows that it does a lot for you, tons of options but my machine really starts to do as expected from newest gen desktop - performs awesome - when i uninstalled System Mechanic.

Now machine just works !"
"I've been using Microsoft products since the early days, and have put up with their flaws in the past, but I just purchased this product as the box said it supported Vista, but had no mention of the 64 bit version not being supported, should have checked reviews under Amazon before buying :-(

So you don't fall into the same issue I and others have, if you really want this product and are using Vista, go to Control Panel, select ""System"", and if it says ""System type: 64-bit Operating System"", do not buy this product.

In fact, I'm so mad at Microsoft on this one for not supporting their own features, I'd say don't but it at all!"
Ok.
"I didn't even know that FrontPage was being discontinued till I consulted the website for help on a technical problem. I ended up buying the upgrade to Expression. Transition was flawless, enabling me to find all my old files right where they should have been.

Only one disappointment. I still can't find a way to change the default font. It's a nuisance to manually change it each time I upgrade my web page."
"I have been using StarOffice since version 5.2, it's a great product.

SUN provides a trial version of Staroffice 8. It's always a good idea to try something before you buy it, especially if you are new to it. Sun also sells a downloadable version of StarOffice 8 at $69.99.

If you are a student or a teacher, you can download StarOffice 8 for free from SUN's education software programm. Actually that's how I get my StarOffice since version 5.2.

StarOffice 8 is based on OpenOffice 2 with a little bit more features, including more fonts, more clip art and 60 days of free support. If those are not important to you, you might just want to download OpenOffice 2.0 since it's totally free.

Here is my experience of using StarOffice.

1. There are many non-Microsoft office softwares, none of them is 100% compatible with Microsoft Office. But the compatibility is more than enough for home users who do not heavily use Macro or scripts. I use StarOffice at home, Microsoft Office at school, I don't have any serious problem to use one to open files created by another.

2. SUN does not provide a full user manual for the downloadable version when I wrote this review though a simple getting-start guide is available at their website, I don't know if it's included in the retail package. That's too bad for new buyers since the features and functions can easily overwhelm anybody. But if you used StarOffice in the past, you should have no problem. I still use the manual of version 7 for version 8 since most of it does not change much. The manual for OpenOffice 2.0 applies for StarOffice 8 too. I just downloaded the manual. It's still in draft version, but looks pretty much complete.

3. StarOffice 8 is a solid package which covers everything for home use.

4. The PDF export function is great.

My overall experience with this software is more than satisfactory."
"""The product is unobtrusive when running and in the time I have used it I am not aware of any malware, viruses or other nasties finding a home on protected PCs. The optimize utility comes in handy and the 25Gb backup storage is perfect for my photo's folder."
So far I'm loving Windows 8 but I am really going to love it when I get kinect for my PC.
Does not load on my computer. Disc is not being recognized by my computer. Not happy at all with this product.
"have been using TurboTax deluxe since the DOS days. Version always had schedules C and rental and farm income forms. Starting in 2013 they stated these weren't available, but they were still in the program until last year. I got my download from a different site and called TurboTax who apologized and they gave me a code to open these forms in the program. I ordered the home business program this year and had no problems installing it on Windows 8.1, as I refuse to install Windows 10. I had no problems downloading it are installing it. The first updates did take a a while to install, but newer ones installed quickly."
Did the forced upgrade to keep my online services.  Data came over without issues and so far everything seems to be working just fine including the bank links.
Good product as I have used Quicken since it was available on a floppy disc.
The worst thing about all microsoft products is that they do not work when they need them to. I was able to purchase but not use the product outside of the US. Switching to all apple was always the way to go.
"The yellow box, the Instant Immersion tag, and the fancy packaging is all an illusion to look like Rosetta Stone. This is not Rosetta Stone! But for the money this is a great set of additional training tools that work fine as a supplement to whatever other method you are using to learn Spanish. You won't learn to speak and understand conversations using just this product, you just won't, but as a bit of brush-up on the side it will help.

The games and iPhone MP3 files are useful. The circa 1980s generic clip-art graphics is just sad. Andere is no real immersion, no real intelligence to the reparation or presentation, and again, I can only recommend if you are looking to use it as a supplement, not as a single-source language learning system.  But for that daunting task, there really is something much better and cheaper than the much hyped Rosetta Stone - take a look at the Spanish Fluenz DVD's --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fluenz-Version-F2-Spanish-1-Win-Mac-with-software-DVD-audio-CD-podcasts-and-Navigator-Learn-Spanish-with-the-latest-upgrade/dp/B000WHBK00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fluenz Version F2: Spanish 1 (Win/Mac) with software DVD, audio CD, podcasts, and Navigator. Learn Spanish with the latest upgrade.</a>&nbsp;They are muy bien!"
I had 6 and then went to 7. This pretty much is the 6 with an improvement of using 64bit. No great new tools or anything (at least that I found or used). It for the most part is a little faster version of 6
It works very well & was cheaper than buying it directly from McAfee.
"I have been using Turbo Tax for years and I have to say it is pretty much ""taxes for dummies"" with the simple way that all you have to do is follow the step by step instructions."
"Howdy, I just wanted to share one BIG problem I've encountered. The ""Business Contact Manager"" (comes on a seperate disk) is NOT compatable with ANY version of ""Intellisync"". So, If you use a Palm device, you will not be able to use the Business Contact Manager and be able to sync your Palm on the same computer. Just wanted to give everyone a fair warning..."
Does the job.  I wish the upgrades and being able to switching to the online version were not so expensive.  I think you get taken advantage of since there is a need for the product.
"I am very pleased with this software. Has almost all the features of Photoshop CS4, with comparable quality, when it comes to editing photo images at 10% of the cost."
"When you have to transfer one user to a different computer because the original computer broke, you can't, and have to call to Microsoft in order they give you a new activation code, the cost of this is $200.00.-
RIDICULOS- because one Microsoft Office cost is $120.00.
Don't BUY Microsoft."
I bought this to replace webpage maker.  The only thing I have found good about it is the price it can;t hold a lite to webpage maker
"i was very happy with encarta 2007 ,works with Vista. the delivery came quick!"
"Didn't work any better than Turbo Tax Basic. Just cost about 20 bucks more.

"Summary: The CorelDraw Suite is a good option for people who want a more polished package of graphics tools than you can get with freeware, but don't want to pay the monthly fee that Adobe currently charges for it Photoshop and other packages.

The suite is a set of programs - primarily a ""draw"" program for creating object graphics and doing page design, and a ""paint"" program for photo and similar editing.  In addition, you get a variety of other, more specific programs (a tracing program, a capture program, etc), a clip art library, and a font library.

I think this package would be great for photo editing, poster or brocure layout, and art projects.  It's relatively easy to learn, and runs on my 4 year old windows 7 computer.  We'll keep it on hand for school and personal graphics jobs, and I am confident it will do fine."
I am very pleased with the amazon service. VERY!!!!
"I have used Quicken for years and have no intention to change -- it's that good!  However, I've been having problems with the program crashing when I try to backup -- roughly, one-out-of-four times."
Always works well! I prefer it to the others.
"Really really bad , they failed in so many ways , its almost like they tried to reinvent the wheel and failed miserably"

"Maybe I am naive but I had assumed these images were in a usable format. Instead, you have to export them, one by one, via a cumbersome 5-step process which is quite pointless and only serves to slow you down. This is not particularly useful to a designer. I just wanted some clip art. Now I see why they charge so little -- they cripple you!

Also I concur that the images are not nearly as good a quality as Hemera would have you believe. All in all, though I love the quantity of images, the quality (and usability) is deeply lacking. Oh, and little would you guess, but if you want more than one computer to be able to use this library (i.e. over a network) you have to call them for a bulk license. Come on! That's what we designers use software like Portfolio for. Not the freeware-quality Hemera Clip Art Thing (tm).

I had high hopes. Now I feel generous in offering two stars for any such products."
"This product was great.  Driving around the country roads in England, I did't need to worry about finding my way. can give an address or just a city and follow the directions. When returning my rental car to the airport, it found me a gas station and then back to the rental return.  Only improvement is that when going into a roundabout (lots and lots of them in England), it said exit 2 and street name but the signs were the street numbers - A24, etc. Not a big problem if you just listen to and follow second exit though.  It also gave an idea of how long the jouney would take so that was helpful too."
I've been using Norton AV for years. Norton was running some kind of sale where this product was the same price as the antivirus only version. It was great timing that my old Norton AV expired just this sale was on. Like the additional utilities it comes with.
Useful home office productivity
"It work superbly! I needed an older version of aperture for my 2007 iMac, that I just put out in my studio."
One of the best total security suites out there.  The encrypted vault feature is also a great plus.
It keeps itself up to date automatically and has not been excessive in pushing me to purchase additional products and coverage.
Very powerful although somewhat short on instructions.  Had to go to previous versions on You Tube for additional information.
Software difficult to use. only gives tables. you need another source to intepret the graphs/grids.
"I would recommend not purchasing any of the backup software products from Roxio or EMC Retrospect.  You cannot get hold of EMC Retrospect by telephone as you leave at message.  Retrospect does not return calls.  If you use online support and submit your question you receive an automated reply that they will answer your question in 1-3 business days.  When you do receive the support reply it will be identical information that is on their web site.  So, you cannot obtain situation specific help from Retrospect.  Retrospect 7.7 Professional is the version needed for Windows 7 (32 & 63-bit), but you cannot purchase a CD version, only a download version at $119.00 for a Home user on a single (up to 2) computer under one license.  As for the Roxio backup products you will be disappointed in them.  You can purchase a CD version.  However, the Backup is only a compressed coded backup, which you cannot see the actual files on you backup media.  You will be disappointed.  However, Roxio will give you a refund less the shipping cost that you paid.  Roxio did not issue a RMA to me; just had to agree that I would remove the software from my PC and not use the software, etc.  I destroyed it - not worth anything.  You can get hold of live person in Roxio Sales but the Sales individuals do not know what the specific products will do or not do.  I have been trying since Nov 2010 to talk to someone at EMC Retrospect (owned by Roxio).  Extremely poor service from what use to be a very good company.  If you do have Retrospect Express or Retrospect Express HD, you will pay $69.95 USD per incident for support, 9 am to 4 pm EST, if they answer the phone at 866-434-1654.  General Sales for Retrospect is 877-793-7482.  Retrospect multi license and for servers can cost over $1.000.  Best of Luck!"
"After getting my clients and myself over to Microsoft Money with them on the way to upgrade to SBA since ""Microsoft products play well"" microsoft pulls stupid yes stupid things like this. This was a record year increase in sales of PPC. Who at Microsoft don't get it? If you release WM5 you would expect any product 2005 on would work on it! When I saw 2007 was out I was happy to be able to go to my clients and say here the wait is over we can go ahead and move up.... But no. Sad. Sorry MS not getting your money and your not getting ours this time. Someone screwed up."
"I have an iMac running OSX, and a Windows computer, all in one thanks to Parallels Desktop 9. I already had a recently purchased MS Windows Office Suite, and a Quicken upgrade, when I decided to go with iMAC and OSX for my next computer system. I was NOT looking forward to repeating those purchases! Parallels to the rescue! Buying Parallels and Windows 7 was much less expensive than buying those two items for MAC! And Parallels does work seamlessly; I can be using MAC software, and immediately open a Windows file, without giving it another thought. Way to go, Parallels!"
Great product! Easy installation
Exactly as advertised.
"I was very excited to have a chance to try this software; I've been using photo manipulating software that's at least ten years old and this promised to do new, exciting things. I found that some aspects of it were great, others I was disappointed with.

On the up side, the interface is very easy to use. Every button has a label (you have to hover to see it) and each process has instructions right there on the screen, no need to keep `help' open. This is great, because the program is set up very differently from PhotoImpact or PhotoShop. It has a set of tools exclusively for shots of people- which is probably the most popular use of photo programs. It has the usual red eye, but also a tooth whitener, a wrinkle remover & skin smoother, and an `eye blinger' (Really? Really? That's the best name you could come up with?) that brightens the whites of eyeballs and darkens lashes. It has a one step tool for making a photo black & white, sepia or color tinted. What I love about this tool is that you can then take a brush and brush items back into their original colors without having to make a mask. This can create some dynamite flower and jewelry photos! The program also contains a tool for removing unwanted items from photos easily- you draw around the object, then drag it over to a section you'd like to replace it with. The place you put it duplicates over the unwanted object. I do a lot of photos of plants and flowers for articles, and there always seems to be an electric line, weed, old step ladder or something in the photo and this is much easier for dealing with that than PhotoImpact is. Despite having these super easy tools, it also has ones that are a little more `pro', like histogram, masks, white balance, HSL/color etc. There are downloadable extras available, as well as updates for the program. It's also a great way to sort and label photos. You can put multiple tags on a photo- a person's name, the location it was shot, the date, whatever- and then use those tags to sort in different ways. It turns your photo collection into a searchable database!

On the down side, since it's a new release I was hoping it would be able to work with some newer file formats. It only handles RAW, JPEG and TIFF, not GIF or PNG. I also wish it had a good feature for adding text- the only way you can add text is to put it into a watermark template.

I can't comment on speed; it's supposed to need a processor that runs at 3.0 GHz and I loaded it onto my laptop that runs at 2.2 GHz. It runs slowly, but not to the point of driving me nuts. Because of the way it works on my computer, I suspect on a 3.0 it would be blazing.

It's an easy, decent photo app and I'll be using it a lot, but I'll also be keeping PhotoImpact for things like text, fancy frames, textures, lenses and artistic effects. For a person who is mainly using it for family photos and event photos, it's really all they'd need."
"I'm almost finished with this program and I can truly say that it has exceeded my expectations. I am now on lesson 29 of the 30 lessons. Lesson 29 covers reflexive verbs and reflexive pronouns. Unless you're a complete newbie to learning Spanish, then you already know that reflexive verbs is one of the most difficult areas of Spanish for native English speakers to learn. The way that other Spanish programs taught the topic of reflexive verbs only drove me crazy.

The instructor in this lesson does an awesome job of teaching this topic. And I now feel that I finally have a solid grasp on the topic. My only complaint about lesson 29 is that the instructor seems to be lecturing a lot more in this lesson, compared to all of the other 29 lessons where there was very little lecturing but lots of drills and exercises. But I guess it was necessary to do a lot of explaining in this lesson so that native English speakers really understand how reflexive verbs function in Spanish.

All of the lessons have a feature that allow you to ""hide"" the text and just here the audio. I recommend that you hide the text. Hiding the text or only looking at it when I want to know how a word is spelled has really helped me to understand spoken Spanish. I'm sure that it has also helped my Spanish pronunciation.

Another tip that I have to help you get the most out of this software is to take advantage of its feature that allows you to add the mp3 audio files to your iPhone or android phone. That way you can learn Spanish while you are doing some other activity. I use the software on my laptop at home and when I have somewhere to drive I listen to the program in my car."
"After seeing mixed reviews here I must say I can only guess high-paid resume writers posted intentionally bad reviews. I enjoyed and appreciated the many options available, whether starting with your own you already have, starting to write a fresh resume, start with choosing from several templates, etc., using suggested phrases & customizable job descriptions, and also being able to quickly add, choose (from a large menu) areas to include in your resume, and quickly, easily change the order they appear as well as then picking the style you would like it to appear, huge list of action words, and well in short, I had in no time designed EXACTLY what I was looking to have my resume look like and more. Finally saving the resume was a cinch too (in different formats) - - and there is plenty of advice and tips available in either video or text (again you can choose what you want to see). I don't see how you could ask for more. It's all there easy and intuitive with more choices than you dream of."
Loved it
I have been using this same version of TM for several years now and have always been very pleased with it.  It is powerful and dependable and does not load down my computers. I use it on my smartphone my tablet in my laptop.
"Was confused when I received this. It was not in an intuit box. The box said 'Home & Business 2013 Microsoft Office' with a sticker on the end stating it was TurboTax Business 2015 (???)... I decided to return, even if it was a burn I've been using Intuit products for 16 yrs and I wasn't about to use some counterfeiIt!"
great
"I have been buying, downloading, installing, and using software for almost 30 years, and this is without a doubt the worst piece of software I have ever encountered. Outlook only loads after clicking through nine error dialogs, it creates 5 empty tasks and 5 error emails to support. If it loads, and that is only 30% of the time, most windows are flaky. For instance clicking on a new project opens a blank email. Any element of the Palm application will reset the palm.

DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE!"
"I've previously been using Painter X3, and this is a nice upgrade - Painter 2015 runs faster, and the particle brushes are a wonderful addition for someone like me who does a lot of fantasy art.  I'm not a pro digital artist or anything - X3 was my first digital art software and I learned a lot by trial and error... turning a photo into a ""painting"" was my first project and it's just as easy with Painter 2015 as it was with X3.  Someone else wrote that a large monitor is necessary to have all the toolbars/options easily viewable, and I agree - it's much easier to work with the program on a 24"" monitor than it is on a 13"" laptop, as you might imagine.

In short, I love the Painter 2015 upgrades, and I do think it's worth upgrading from X3."
This really beat getting a lawyer.  I wrote a new will and advance directive in a couple of hours.  I recommend this to everyone.
"I purchased this item for my husband as a gift.  He is so happy with how easy it is to use.  He has been tracing his family's background for awhile and really had no way to organize, compare facts, and arrange dates until he starting using this program.  I did a review of other products and decided on RootsMagic4 because of other feedback and the ease of using this program.  My husband loves this program and feels like all the paper, notes and newspaper articles he has been working on are now organized and located at his fingertips with this wonderful program.  He always remarks to me what a super job I did in finding such a great genealogy software.  I love the fact his office and work area are now neat and organized. :)"
"There were no contract forms for hiring subcontractors, or debt collection.  'nuff said."
"This is my first year trying H&R Block software.  This software seems to work fine for basic returns, but why would you buy Premium if you just had a basic return?  When calculating Fed estimated tax payments, it doesn't allow replacement of the 1st estimated tax payment with a prior year refund, rather it reduces all est tax payments by the refund and doesn't calculate state estimated tax payments.  It doesn't handle income from partnerships well:  asks if there are unreimbursed expenses, but never provides a place to input them (after a 2 hour ""chat,"" H&R said this version doesn't support unreimbursed partnership expenses), doesn't correctly handle non-passive partnership income on Sch 8960, doesn't carry partnership income to all the necessary places on the state return.

I caught at least 3 errors and had to manually adjust for them or my tax liability would have been overstated by several thousand dollars.

H&R's support team has only cursory knowledge of tax laws and during my 2 hour ""chat"" attempted to direct me to incorrect forms many, many times.  I suspect the members of H&R support team have never actually prepared anything other than a basic return and are just answering questions based on canned responses."
We buy this every year and It is so easy to use.
Been using norton for years works great have a lot of computer users in the family so everybody's covered not to mention the tablets and cell phones. ( Awesome product )

Unfortunately it is a complete review but of an older version.
"I just changed out my companies three seven year old PC's running Quickbooks 2005. I use apple at home and like it, so I bought three new Imac's and a three license Quickbooks for Mac 2012. The old Quickbooks 2005 worked good, so I figured that the new 2012 would be better. I also figured that Quickbooks was Quickbooks and it didn't matter if it was for a PC or a Mac,  nothing could be farther from the truth. The  Quickbooks for Mac is junk! Its slower then my old 2005 and it is missing many of the 2005's features, price levels being just one.
Lucky for me I have a good IT guy. He downloaded a program called Parallels, then installed Windows XP on my Mac's and got Quickbooks to swap out the Mac version for the Windows version. The Quickbooks 2012 for Windows is way better then the Mac version, so much so that I don't know why they even make the Mac version. If you never ran Quickbooks before then I guess you would think its OK. But if you now have an older version running on a PC and switch to a Mac you are in for a big disappointment."
"Shipping was very fast. Arrived packed well and secure. Saved alot over new price. Installation was a pain. Installed from cd which removed older version, then had to go online and download again from website to ""activate"". That took hours with a good connection. With dialup it would take days! The whole time com was unprotected. That's over and good 4a year."
This was absolute garbage and didn't protect worth a damn.  After only a few months we couldn't so much as turn our computer on due to the fact it was so infected.  We ended up wiping out to original factory condition and installing Kaspersky pure 3.0.  Now it is running smoothly with no problems.
"After years of sticking with the Norton family of products and their enormous drain on system resources, I made the switch to PC-Cillin with their 2005 version and removed every trace of Norton.  I was extremely impressed--it was finding things that Norton didn't, and my computer was running faster than I'd ever seen before.

When my year of updates ran out, I eagerly upgraded to the 2006 version.  I was impressed with the great new features and sharp improved interface.  Unfortunately, I also noticed an instant drop in the speed of my system.  Everything--not just internet--is now at a crawl.  It freezes up at least once a day.  Looks like I'll have to find a new brand for my antivirus/internet software next year."
Excellent Service and Product as listed.  Thank you.
"Ok, so the menus are a bit different, but like that they got rid of the Office button and replaced it with the File menu. Makes it a bit easier to navigate with what you want to do.

Runs a lot faster than the old version of office, and the help files are a big plus."
"If you try to open any of your files you created in previous Hallmark versions, 2012 will corrupt the file and you will not be able to open any projects.  They have said they are ""working"" on the problem with a fix.  I am very upset about this - some of the files I use for my business."
Was a birthday gift for daughter who is a budding writer.
The software loaded easily and quickly on all 3 computers. It cleaned up a couple of adware issues and the main computer seems to be running faster. Highly recommend!
"I've been online since the 1990's and have always been security conscious. I've been using Norton since it came pre-installed on my first PC. Later I added Spybot Search & Destroy and Zone Alarm.  Keeping them co-existing in peace has required some tweaking over time, but all was well until a couple of months ago when I updated Zone Alarm.  My fast pc slowed down and start-up took forever. I tried all sorts of fixes and nothing worked.  I decided I had to find one security suite that could handle most issues.  After researching lots of sources I decided to go with Trend Micro Internet Security 2008.  My install went flawlessly and I've been extremely pleased with the ease of use and unobtrusive nature of this software.

Here's a play-by-play version of what I did: first, I defragmented my hard drive; next I uninstalled Spybot (in the uninstall help file they even tell you which file you need to manually remove and where to find it!); after that I uninstalled Zone Alarm; and finally, the real pain, I uninstalled Norton System Works.  This has to be done carefully and involves a number of different steps.  (Norton has an uninstaller online, but I've had a problem with that in that past.)  You must do the uninstall in the proper order and be certain that you do all the separate parts ie the automatic updater.  Also, Norton files are hidden all through the computer so they have to be searched out and deleted manually.  When that was done, I defragmented my hard drive again.  My final step was inserting the Trend Micro CD, re-enabling my internet connection when it became mandatory, updating the software and running a scan.

It took a long time to do the above, but I think it's a good way to install any new security software.  I think some of the problems people have had with Trend Micro might be related to not starting off as ""clean"" as possible.  Hope this is helpful."
"Well i was a little skeptical at first with some of the reviews about this product but then first hand experience i was shocked to find they were right.  This version of Nero is P.O.S its a shame they force you to upgrade....i went from Nero 7 to this program....Nero 7 would copy a movie in about 20 mins this program takes about an hour if it ever finishes ...usually freezes.  before that it took me 4 hours to install and the installer program wanted to freeze i counted 356 times that i had to hit close but it never did.  I am going to call customer support because this is ridicules...its not my computer its the program.  Vista 32 bit, 2.88 giga hrtz dual core Pentium, with 8 gigs of ram and 9600 ge force graphics card and 2 Terabytes of memory ....again its not the computer... i would advice anyone if you can saty with nero 7 or 8 please do so ...the extra additive features on this program are no where near worth it besides burning blue rays is a waste of money it almost costs the same to burn one as it does to buy the movie. CHOA!"
"When it works, it is fantastic.  One star off for below par customer support."
"Something like this is undoubtedly necessary, and Diskeeper MAY be the best available too, but it's buggy.  The ""set it and forget it"" feature doesn't work at all; when an automatic defragmentation should begin, the program pops up a message saying it can't continue due to inconsistencies on the disk.  The first two or three times this happened (this is on an XP Home system), I scheduled ChkDisk, rebooted, etc.  But (a) there wasn't anything wrong with the disk,  and (b) it didn't solve the problem with Diskeeper.  Now, when I see that message, I open Diskeeper and start the defragmentation manually.  Sometimes the program refuses to do a manually started defragmentation, saying there's an inconsistency; but there IS no inconsistency, and when I restart the defragmentation, it works just fine.  In addition, directory consolidation does NOT put all the directories together, and it takes forever.  The hard-drive is only 20% utilized, so don't start thinking of excuses for this!"
I have used Pinnacle Studio v10 for several years and found it a very user friendly program. I have been working with computer since the early 80's and learn programs fairly easily. I found Pinnacle Studio 17 very difficult to use an not intuitive at all. It appears that Pinnacle Studio people decided to take a very good program up to v15 and make 16 and 17 a nightmare. There are some good aspects to 17 but the learning curve is very difficult. I have gone on line to the utube tutorials and gotten help there but even there some of the experts agree with me that this program is very difficult.  I have been working on it for a month and still am trying to figure out some aspects of the program. I would not recommend this program to anyone. I am very sorry I purchased the program.
I have used paperport for about 6 yrs now. I first used it at my work where we scanned thousands of documents for a law suit. Last yr purchased V 11.0 for my personal use.  I just purchased v 12.0 with the new and better features especially the PDA features to install on my new computer.  Highly recommend the product.
"I found it disappointing. Having used TurboTax last year I really felt that TTax was more user friendly and provided more useful information and was definitely easier to navigate. The one attempt I had made to ""chat"" with a tax advisor was worthless and of no consequence. I will probably follow Block to a conclusion since I refuse to spend any additional money on tax software but I admit I did seriously think about buying TTax in addition to Block."
Good program !~
This program crashed repeatedly. I thought Apple was supposed to be crash proof.  I will go back soon to try and figure out how to get it to run.  I may have to replace it with Apple ware
As Expected. Fast Shipping - would recommend.
"If you have never used Norton Systemworks and you are using any Windows operating system, before you finish reading this sentence click the ""Add to Shopping Cart"" button.  This is the best utility around for fixing Windows problems and keeping your computer running smoothly.  The package includes Norton Utilities, Norton Antivirus and Norton Cleansweep.  I use all three every week.  They are an indespensible combination of applications.
If you have NSW 2002, this version really doesn't provide all that much that is new.  The most noticeable change other than a change in the interface color scheme is a new utility for removing web content such as history, cache and cookies.  While Cleansweep already does this, the new utility allows you to view each item individually so you can pick the ones you want to delete.  It organizes the content two different ways: by date and by the web site of origin.  For most people, this is more detail than they want or need and Cleansweep's cleanup utility is fine.  This just gives the user a little more control of what gets deleted.
Unless selective deletion of web content is important to you, I would say this isn't an essential upgrade.
If you have never owned this product, why are you still reading?

"Quickbooks has helped me seamlessly manage my books, track sales and expenses. The feature that allows it to sync with my bank account is AMAZING!! I don't have to match receipts to everything anymore because Quickbooks does it for me. I will always use Quickbooks now... it has made my business run so much smoother."
"I'm not an accountant. In fact, I'm terrible with numbers - but somehow, Quickbooks has made my life running a company so much easier. I own a small business with three partners, and despite my lack of accounting knowledge - I have learned so much and now handle all of our finances using this amazing product. My partners trust me to handle it because I trust myself - and it's all because of Intuit and Quickbooks Online! I don't know where we'd be with out our QB!"
I like Microsoft Money.  It makes everything easy for someone who is not an accountant or has trouble keeping track of where your money goes.

"I had Prevx and Webroot bought them out. Prevx was an excellent product and I had no issues with it. I run a small company with PCs accessing programs from a fileserver. When Webroot took over, it knocked anything executing over the LAN down to a crawl. It also has a nasty side-effect of not allowing copy and paste between some of my apps. (I managed to find a control setting to fix that issue.)

From a protection standpoint, it is very good. Tech support is OK; they get back to you within a day or so, but sometimes not with the correct solution, so beware.

Bottom line for me is good protection, but tends to slug the machine down. Would buy over Norton and McAfee any day."
"(Trying again.  Most of my review was removed).
Until this year, I've always been able to file my taxes using TurboTax Basic.  I use Schedule D for stock transactions, and Form 3800 because I own a limited partnership with tax credits (not for business purposes).  I knew about the Schedule D issue and reluctantly upgraded to Premier to avoid the hassle of switching products.  However, I discovered that Premier won't fill out the for 3800.  The form is in the software, but it won't take my carryover from last year and generate the form.  Instead the software is requiring that I pay more money and upgrade to TurboTax Home & Business.  Unbelievable."
"my personal review
this software works fine and well as a matter of fact I am doing this review with it
the seller was prompt on shipping it, he's a good seller
the only issue I had is with the creator of the software
they make you register the product through the Internet
and they have full control of it every time you start the program"
"I've always liked Quicken despite its flaws. I upgraded from the 2013 product and had a couple of small issues. But now it's working fine. I have only one peeve and that's the dialog for entering dividends: financial web sites list the shares before the dollar amount but Quicken reverses that.

I hope the new owners keep developing the product."
"I have to say that by and large, Vista is better.  Excel 2007 is absolutely horrible to me, though.  I've used Excel XP a LOT, and am very familiar with it.  The transparent interface and flexibility with its functions and Macros is unparalleled by anything this side of Matlab or Mathematica, plus you can do so many every-day things too.

With Excel 2007, Microsoft seems to be trying to appeal to the stupid among the masses who are impressed with eye candy, and ease and simplicity of easy and simple tasks, so they've dumbed down the functionality and constrained many of their functions that were previously general and flexible so as to be only for one clearly defined product bullet point.  For instance: in Excel XP you used to be able to use conditional formatting on almost anything such as making the text color grey if the value is equal to that of the cell above, now you can pretty much only use conditional formatting in limited ways on numbers alone.  Almost any time I've tried to do anything with Excel 2007 beyond just data entry, it took at least 10 times longer than it would in XP, trying to figure out how to modify their designer's vision of what all spreadsheets should be like into what I want, or how to interpret their much to colloquially worded dialog boxes, ultimately having to resort to agonizing trial-and-error for something they should just state plainly.  The most consistently annoying thing for me (and this is just one example of many similar things) is that the combination of Ctrl+Shift+Down (and Up) doesn't do a **** thing anymore - they haven't put it to use, not even on something I wouldn't but others would use, it just does absolutely nothing!  Ctrl+Shift+Left and Ctrl+Shift+Right still work, but not Up or Down! (Ctrl+Shift+Down used to select every cell starting at the current cell and going down until it either encountered a blank cell or stopped encountering non-empty cells - similar controls exist in all Microsoft software)  I would and could write a Macro to do this that runs off the Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down shortcut and it's really not too difficult, but then you can't undo afterword, as you can't with any Macros in Office products.

Basically, if you have any significant geeky or right-brain leanings, or if you've grown very comfortable with past versions of Excel, you will almost certainly be frustrated with this and find yourself trying to get Pre-Vista Excel installed on your Vista computer.  I sincerely hope this is not the future of Microsoft software."
like the free version. Couldn't upgrade to pro. Avast wouldn't accept payments from either my bank account or PayPal.
"This is pretty good for a home user that just wants to add some titles and transitions etc. to video. I suppose a motivated person could make a movie with this, but some of the choices in behavior of the GUI are baffling. The way that it stops playback when you click certain menus can be maddening when you're trying to make several quick edits. It's also disappointing that the resolution of the timeline editing isn't in small enough increments to easily sync secondary audio. Meaning that if you try and use audio from a non-video source there are times when you simply can't make the audio sync with the lips of the people talking. Dumb.

As stated, it's probably ok for many users and there are some cool features included for the price, but I feel that certain workflow behaviors could be handled differently as well as more intuitively. That may or may not be a big deal to you, but I don't exactly love certain aspects of this software."
really liked the user friendly ability. got very comfortable with it. don't like the one that comes with windows 7
It had everything a girl would want to play on a software!!
"I ran the upgrade from Leopard and then immediately added the 10.6.1 update.  This added many of the missing printer drivers, and also apparently fixes the problem with Office 2004, because my copy launched and ran just fine, and my printer still works despite not being on the current list at apple's support site.  So far, no problems whatsoever.  Thanks, apple, for putting out that update so fast."
This version is more complicated than previous version - less friendly for those who have done taxes in the past.  Hard to navigate
"I have been using FTM since the bad old DOS days. The 2011 release of FTM is by far the worst most memory hungry version ever introduced. The number of crashes per day are too many to bother keepinhg a log of.
I have reinstall the opersting system and FTM 2011 more then once to try and overcome the memory leak issues this 2011 version was released with. The program crashes wthout warning, no error messages, or just sits idle with the ""Program not responding"". It does help if you run the program as administrator...a little too little for me.
Several attempts to help the FTM development team overcome and identify the memory leak issues have resulted in a single reply susggesting it is a .NET issue from microsoft, suggesting I reinstall it. Load the program, check the amount of memory used at 10 minute intervals using the Task manager and you will observe the sprialing increase in memory usage until you run out of memory and the program will crash.
I'm going back to version 2010 and until they wake up and catch up with the rest of the computing community with a 64 bit version I'll pass all future updates. FTM was always the standard by which all other genealogy programs were measured, they have lost that edge and only time will tell if they can ever recover?"
This was my 3rd year.. easy to use
This s**ks.  Every time I turn around this software loses all my writing
"I purchased these maps for a driving trip through Switzerland, Austria, Germany and Italy. On the whole the maps themselves were excellent, finding the smallest roads, alleys etc. I purchased the CD as opposed to the SD card after reading reviews stating the card cannot be updated and some route planning software had to be purchased separately that was on the CD.
Here's where I got into trouble, As many reviewers stated assembling and downloading the regions to your unit is not very intuitive and pretty cumbersome (I'm trying not to stay stupid). Being that I had an extra 1 gig SD card around I only wanted to download the portions of Europe I needed. I made a route for my trip and made waypoints (hotels airports, sites I wanted to see etc) I zoomed in on the area of Europe for my trip. I highlighted all the oddly shaped regions that crossed borders, included portions of the Mediterranean etc, and downloaded them to my GPS. I cross checked the whole thing once downloaded. I simulated take me from point A to point B on my trip. GPS said calculating and let's go. Wonderful I thought that wasn't bad at all.
Upon arrival all worked well until I entered Zurich and Milan. As I approached, detail would start to disappear, and then side roads, then the representation of the car on the GPS would be in a void next to the one or two roads still on the screen that didn't seem to really exist. The GPS would keep repeating ""Drive to highlighted route"". This happened to me both times we were in Zurich and Milan. We finally had to resort to good old maps. After leaving the area the GPS would slowly regain its brain.
Back in the US I called Garmin tech support. They told me that they had never heard of anything like it and offered to replace my unit. After much trial and error, back home I figured it out. When I selected the regions I was going to, my zoom level on the map was to low and the tiny tiny city regions of Zurich and Milan could not be seen and I could not tell they were not highlighted. They appeared to be part of the much bigger geographical regions surrounding them.
I know technically this was my doing, but who would have thought I need to select the black dots that were Zurich and Milan. With all this being said, My GPS never gave me an error stating part of my route was missing I was driving through, during creation or during the actual driving. It just said calculating 100 % and GO. No errors, it just started to loose its mind like the HAL9000 computer when Dave Poole started pulling out the memory ( Daisy Daisy how does your garden grooooooowwwww[...])
Moral of story buy a 2 gig card and download the whole thing or zoom way in and be very careful. I'm sure there are still a few, always in a bad temper European drivers, thinking, ""What was that idiot in that Peugeot doing"" Thank You for that Garmin."
Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So Im short about 19 0r so words for your review.
"I was referred to this product through a contact at the American Marketing Association.  What a great piece of advice!
This is impressive software from every perspective.  I found it easy to use, the content is excellent throughout, and the sample marketing plans were amazing.  Check out ""Interior Views"" for example.  The other resources, including the associated book, were also valuable for me.
My marketing plans looks great and I would not have been able to accomplish this task so efficiently without this software."
So simple and fast
This product indicates that that it comes with earbuds and a microphone which it does not.  One of the reasons I purchased this was because it was a one stop shop for my needs.  I turned to Amazon for help and they pointed me to Rosetta Stone.  Chatted with Rosetta Stone and they pointed me back to Amazon.  I really wish that I didn't make this purchase.
"The software is fine and works as advertised. The problem is how they advertise their licensing and position ""support renewals."" After a year you will start getting notices that your support subscription has expired. Shortly after that your software will stop working. When you call for help they'll tell you that you need to renew your support to get help. Then, miraculously, your software will start working again. I have have licensed two different products from this company and had the same experience with both.

I finally got them to acknowledge via email that we are not renewing support, but in fact are renewing a license. It would be nice if they made it clear up front that these products require an annual subscription to use. They way they refer to this as a ""support subscription"" is extremely misleading. I won't do business with this company going forward."
They stopped supporting this product about a year ago.  There is nobody on the forums.  Dont Buy!
We are thoroughly satisfied with this product.  It installs pretty quickly and is easy to use. Even our four year old granddaughter can use it without supervision.
Worked fine; MAC still a little clunky for running applications like Office but that's MAC versus windows
Cool

"I have used the Broderbund Family Tree Maker Version 4 ( it says version 4.4 on the CDs) since about the year 2000. It used to cause runtime errors with my PCs, and it doesn't run well if you try to load pictures into it, but I have stuck with it for a few reasons. First, I was being frugal in not buying a different software right away. Second, I had already committed a long of energy and time in entering my hardcopy files. So, I continue to use it today. The thing is, I am tired of using clunky software and would love to upgrade. As soon as I find the best software to choose, that will also import my FTM files, I am going to make the change.

If you want family history software and you can't afford to buy it, and someone wants to give you this for free, then I recommend it for you. Otherwise, if you are purchasing new, I strongly encourage you to buy a newer and better product."
A VERY USEFUL TOOL
"One of the worst product ever. I can't even rate this product since I can't even connect to it under windows 8. After dealing with the tech support guy for an hour, he tells me that there are issues with PP14 and windows 8!!"
"The instructions are VERY clear, But the picture quality is HORRIBLE."
It was useless
I love it when a product does exactly what I expect. It was easy to use and the pictures look wonderful.
"Very disappointed in this year's version. Would give it 0 stars if I could. Classic bait-and-switch; you pay for a premium product, that then charges additional fees for basic functionality that the same software had last year, for no reason whatsoever. It actually would have cost the company less money to just leave those features in, but instead, they paid programmers to remove those features from the premium feature set, and now charge additional fees for what use to be included, with no justification.

I will not buy Intuit products in the future."
Great product.
"Red Hat 8 is out, and it is muuuuch better!  If you want phone support you need to buy the professional edition; otherwise, you just get email help - which isn't much help.  If you are a newbee Windows type of person I would seriously consider Red Hat Professional.  Why spend all evening cussing your computer?  The only other Linux edition I would consider is Xandros.  I haven't tried it yet, but Xandros is the follow on to the old Corel Second Edition of Linux which was a great piece of work."
My computer is taking several minutes to startup but maybe it is secure. The Bitdefender Safe-Pay that it comes equipped with is a royal Pain. It logs me out with each transaction.
"First of all there is no good AVCHD video editing product available. So if you want an easy, fast, simple and LOGICAL program to put your AVCHD on a blue ray disk - Good Luck !!

That being said. This program does not work. I did all the updates and patches. I spent over 25+ hours (not including burning) trying to make it work. Did I say it doesn't work? It would take over 8 hrs to attempt to burn a blue ray. Every time it crashed before completing. (and it's not my computer). So I wasted 2 disks. Worst still it doesn't tell you why it crashed. Just a simple ""did not complete"" pop up tab.

Ok. So what do you do? I make simple blue ray burns with the Pinnacle Studio 12 software. Granted NONE of the fancy add on stuff works. No menus no nothing. But it doesn't waste expensive blue ray disks and it does allow you to burn without issue. Just keep it simple and don't expect (or better yet don't even attempt) anything fancy.

So we wait. There is a reason why I tried this program. I wanted it to work. I wanted to make AVCHD video's in blue ray just like my old dvd's. It's just not time yet.

Also - one more thing - the 'easy burn' option - doesn't work. It doesn't even make sense. There is no 'save' feature. So you do your whole set up in one shot (risking an hour or more with each attempt). But it is worthless.

Also 2 - can they just make a simple program that is logical? I get the feeling that non-Americans are writing this type of program. They are not logical in any way. You really have to 'learn the language' in all these types of programs."
"What more is there to say... I keep losing work! It crashes an average of 2-3 times per day.

I have the 7.2 update for my Mac OS X.3... it doesn't seem to help any."
"My job requires that I make heavy usage of a PC and related software.  But personally, I like the design of a Mac more.  Fusion has been a terrific tool for helping me to get the best of both worlds.  In general:

* If you really need windows and don't really need the Mac OS: Then I would stick with a PC.  Only because the Mac has taken a number of shortcuts with their keyboard that will drive you crazy.  Fusion is helpful, but it doesn't replace these shortcomings of a Mac.

* If your primary OS is PC, but you like to use the Mac sometimes.  Then Fusion may be the answer for you.  In general, I would still say you'll be happier with a PC because of the above reasons.

* If your primary OS is a Mac, but you occasionally have to make use of the PC OS.  Then Fusion is definately the answer for you.  Our company supports Microsoft CRM, so our users have to use the PC OS, Internet Explorer 7+ and usually Outlook.  So they can't use just the Mac OS.  But many of our clients use the Mac OS in their environment.  Fusion has given them a great solution for using the Mac OS for most of their work, while providing them with a seamless way to also use Microsoft Dynamics CRM.

The biggest downside: You need to not only purchase Fusion, but you also have to purchase Windows and other related software.

One other aside: One of my co-workers has noticed that the Laptop version of Microsoft CRM for Outlook crashes her Mac when it is running Vista.  Although I did not have this problem, we had to uninstall it for her."
"I was sold on this item for two reasons.  1) it was rated high (Not just on Amazon).  I was not happy with the current anti virus program I have had for 2 years.  2) the seller responded and took action for one of the low rating I read on Amazon.  Customer service is about 50 percent of my purchases.  I hope I don't have to contact them for support, but if I do, I hope they are as helpful.  Installation was very easy.  The picture shows a box, but what I got was a disc in a sealed case.  Not a lot of paperwork/small print to read.  Just pop the disk in and follow the instructions.  Since removing my previous program and installing this one, I have notice a difference in my computer's speed.  Right off, this program found to trojans and cleaned them out.  I only mention that because my license for the previous software was still good for 11 days and I just updated the program 3 days ago, as I did every Wednesday.  My current software should have caught it as soon as it appeared or suspected, as it use to do.  Great product.  Trust me, if my opinion of this product changes, I will give an update."
its a really good product for more intermediate film editors. what I can say its definitely better than Sony Movie studio.
The box states that this game is compatible with Mac OS X 10.2 or later.  This is a lie.  I have OS X 10.5 Leopard and there are many others on the PlayFirst forums who are in the same shoes.  The setup program does NOT work for Leopard.  Do NOT buy this if you are a Mac OS X 10.5 user.
"An initial caveat: I am comparing this to QB Pro 2011 PC, which was the previous version of QB that  we had been using.

I installed the program on our Mac that had already been upgraded to the El Capitan operating system.  I had no difficulties with the installation.  I had been previously using QB 2011 via Parallel, and it took a couple of tries to get a working version of a backup that I could then open up in the Mac 2016. Once I did, all of my previous data did transfer over with the exception of my customized forms.

Mac 2016 looks nearly identical to  the  Pro 2011 for PC version, so I can't really comment on what may be lacking over previous PC versions.  The only thing I find difficult to use is the attachment feature, which was not an option with the earlier PC version.  I would have hoped that in the 5 years since I last purchased the software, they would have realized that Mac users are serious business owners, too. It would be nice to have the option to have the different versions of the software like the PC world does so I don't have to manually create all the different forms and categories.

My one major complaint with the software, and part of the reason for my 4 star rather than 5 star review (along with the lack of different versions for different business types and limited customer service options when you do run in to a problem), is the constant reminders that Intuit also sells additional services such as payroll and credit card processing...Thank you very much, Intuit. With those outrageous fees and constant reminders, I'll make sure you fall to the bottom of my list if I decide to add those features on at some point.

Update: After working with the software some more, I have finally figured out how to use the attachment feature (the problem was on my end and not QB's).  This is a great feature and upgrade from QB 2011 since I send out very detailed estimates and being able to attach those to the more basic estimate I generate in QB is going to save a lot of time down the road.  I do still miss some of the flexibility that came with QB Pro as far as reports and forms.  QB for Mac is geared more towards a product driven business vs a consulting or service type.  Hopefully that will be remedied in future versions."
"I have not used in a while but when I was using it, it was pretty awesome."
"I have been using AVG anti-virus (free version) for more than ten years and I am very satisfied with it; it just does the job. From that perspective I went to buy AVG PC TuneUP.

It just does the job is meant to do and does it well. I gave it four stars. Some other users might say that they love avast, or norton or whatever other software. I have not try all of them. Maybe someone might say other software is better.

During my early days as computer freshmen I try several tuneup utilities and some were not effective or not efficient, other would drain too much resources from the machine taking in account what they were doing and so on.

The only feature I don't like from AVG PC TuneUp is that gives me more notifications than I wish to receive. I just need the software to do its job without annoying me with notifications of what it is doing. I know there is a menu to customize those notifications but some how that menu is too big for my taste and I am too busy doing my stuff as to take time to navigate that menu. I am a professor and a researcher and I need my computer to let me do my stuff without annoyances.

Update June 05/ 2014
The software keeps asking me for the license number over and over, I have input the license number several times, it is becoming really annoying!"
"Awesome product, allows you to work on your computer worry free. I've used Kaspersky products for a number of years and highly recommend them."
"I needed to upgrade from Money 2004 since I purchased a new computer with Vista.  Loved the upgrade, especially the LifePlanner sections.

Makes all financial tasks and organization so easy."
I had issues with PC download.  I run 64 bit Windows 7 and Amazon downloader would not work on any browser no matter what I did.  Tech support tried to help but their suggestions did not work.  I was able to download and install it but running Windows compatibility program which changed the compatibility settings for Amazon downloader to Windows XP.  That did the trick.  I am not sure if anyone else had similar issues.  I did not expect the simple download to take up most of the morning though.
Great application so useful and needed
"still trying to figure the dam thing out
it is massive
so everything I try on it I first make sure I have it saved in Word, plotlines in XL - which after all was not the reason I bought it"
"I bought Acronis True Image 8.0 because I have a new laptop from Dell who no longer ship the disks necessary for a complete rebuild of the operating system (instead, there is a Ghost image of the factory build on another partition ON THE SAME DISK). I needed a way of securing my operating system state against a variety of risks - worms, finger trouble, head crashes, regretted purchases of software, etc.

I suspect a lot of you are now in the same boat, especially if your investigations have led you here!

Acronis True Image is slap bang in the middle of the market niche resulting from Dell's new approach. For that reason it gets 5 stars. I used it to create a standalone bootable version of itself on CD (making 2 copies), after which I uninstalled it from my laptop (which I like to keep clean of unused software).

The standalone disk successfully backed up my hard drive to 7 CDs using the self same CD drive that I had booted Acronis standalone from. Subsequently I used it in the same way to rehearse my restore, with 100% success. I did all the partitions on the hard drive in the same operation. This is important if Dell PC Restore (Ctrl-F11) is to survive.

Q: WHY DOES IT GET SUCH A BAD PRESS ???

A: Because the design and implementation are absolutely appalling. This is not sloppiness, it is ignorance and naivety. I can go as far as to say that this product COULD HAVE COST ME UNTOLD CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS AND DAMAGE if I hadn't spent hours on the Internet searching for clues from other users' experiences. All because you don't know whether to believe this bloody message or not!!!

""Error opening file, a possible reason may be poor media quality.""

I got to the bottom of this - it is benign. It just means Acronis can't distinguish between hitting a bad patch on the CD and reaching the end. The error message author just wanted to err on the side of pessimism!

Note that on restore, I was asked to feed the disks in in a very strange order, suggesting the product runs through all the disks in the set, after which it returns for one last go at any that were dodgy. In fact, that was NOT what it was doing. The disks were all perfect. In my case, there were 3 partitions in the disk set. In order to restore a partition, Acronis seems to need to vist the first and then the last CD containing any part of the partition in question, before it will deign to restore the body of it.

Overall, this is the right product at the right time. Yes - you could have written it so much better yourself, but it does work, and introduces no clutter. Recall, I uninstalled it after creating my standalone CDs. Indeed it even enables you to dispense with other suppliers' clutter (I have also got rid of those space-hungry nannies Norton virus checker and Windows System Restore now that I have my preferred form of disaster recovery nailed down)."
Very good price from Amazon and was pretty easy to install on my notebook with email instructions.
Don't bother
"Easy to navigate, no problem with download after purchase, love the upgrade. Finished product very professional. Would recommend to others"
Orders it each year
"This very easy-to-use gadget is wonderful! While I will need to spend more time to study the advanced techniques a little more, the easy start up method is amazingly simple. When I got stumped, the courteous tech assistant was also helpful, patient, and informative. Now, I can transfer precious film memories, as well as audio cassettes without a hitch! ;-)"
"Awesome product, I spent over $100 on a different one from a different website and it was terrible. This product actually talk me some great words/phrases."
This is a great product. We were able to reduce our tax burden by 60%. It was a great value as well.
I t has been very time consuming to get the product up and running. It certainly is nothing like the advertisements. I am still in the process of fine tuning it. Too much time to set up. I do not feel like purchasing an upgrade at this time as I do not want to be disappointed with money spent and taking too long to see results.
I have gotten this Antivirus Software from Webroot for the last 3-4 years and it works great.
I have always liked Kapersky as a great internet security method.
"I stumbled across HDR Efex Pro 2 in Lightroom after I purchased the suite, it is marvelous.  I shoot homes for reality companies and for MLS listings, before starting using this program, I would lug around a dozen flashes, set them up, balance the light so the room would look evenly light without dark or hotspots.  This program makes it simple, I put the camera on a tripod, set my AES at (varies depending on the ambient light in the room) say -1,0 +1 take three images, import them into lightroom send them to Efex Pro and the program will ask me if I want to merge the images into an HDR I click yes and it creates an HDR image, from there you can do it simply there are a number of presets, ranging from neutral to extreme (depending on the look, not something I'd be looking for), but there are sliders you can use to bump of various parts of the photo without the ""over cooked"" HDR look, say the room has dark hardwood floors and I want to draw attention to floor I can just move one slider a fraction and it brings out the detail in the floor.  A very simple slider lets you determine how realistic you want the image to look.
Cut my work time by hours and hours."
The analysis was good when he got around to it.  Too much discussion about chess lore and trivia.  I don't really care about who won what when or which tournament they played in.  Cut to the chase.  These cds aren't cheap and I think he could have covered more relevant material than he did.  Now Nigel Davies and Simon Williams: those guys know how to focus and deliver.
So far 2013 works OK and I have not had any problems.  Based on others reviews I just use it for the basics and could be the reason I have not experienced the problems mentioned.  I have not downloaded the mobile app and based on reviews probably will not.  My biggest complaint was that in order to keep using our online banking I had to upgrade to the 2013 version as Intuit was stopping their support for the version I was using at the time.  If I had not wanted to avoid the time and hassel of switching to another software I definitely would not have upgraded.  Will probably have to upgrade again in another couple of years.  Such a deal.
I like being able to continue reading on any of my devices and it will go to the last page read.  Great app!
"Great value, especially when the renewal is much more expensive, just order a new one each year"
Loaded right on Windows 7 no hassles.  Have already copied 5 VHS to DVD and even though they're 30 year old copies The quality is very good
"This is a very good program to do the steps that I want to take.
Its an easy software to work with"
"WP remains the best word processing programme on the market. The version merely confirms the fact. The only reason why MSWord has become the industry standard is Windows dominance of the desktop. Only WP gives one perfect control of the document, provides real stability, and easy formatting. It also reads other formats and then allows saving to the dreaded MSWord. Pity that WP is not available in Linux versions."
"I would give this ZERO stars if I could, but 1 is the lowest you can go.  I had Pinnacle studio and always had problems with it crashing so I decided to try a new one.  After reading all the reviews on several programs, I decided to go with Corel Video Studio.  All I am trying to do is create a simple slide show of photos with music and some very basic editing effects.  Sounds simple, right?  Well, once you figure in the 16, yes SIXTEEN times it has either locked up or just crashed so far, it is not so simple.  I took two weeks ""off"" from finishing it because I got so frustrated and now tried it again.  Here is what I just did:  changed one of the songs and went to watch it on playback thru the editor.  Here is what happened;  LOCKED UP.  couldn't do anything so I had to ctrl/alt/del to get it shut down.  Tried it again, and now it locked my whole system up and had to power off to get it to reset.  No the hardware is not the issue, I'm running a Core 2 Quad CPU with 2GB RAM.  This program is horrible and I would STRONGLY suggest you avoid it unless you like wasting a very large amount of time and effort and just becoming frustrated with the whole process.  Nice concept but VERY POOR SOFTWARE!"
I gifted this and it was the hit of the season
"A little fun getting used to it, but it was teriffic. It STILL is teriffic. Have installed it only on one computer, my laptop. Works beautifully. Watch the serial number that you have to insert to get it installed, because some letters look like numbers and some numbers may look like letters. Maybe get a magnifying glass to look at them before inserting in computer and getting a notice that it does not recognize what you've entered!"
"In all of my years of computing (and I'm some what of a geek), this is easily the worst software package I've ever thrown money away on.  It does not install properly (even after several clean re-installs), those programs that work  seem to conk-out right as they're nearing the finishing line.  A major waste of $$$ and time."
This old first version included whole body animation that new versions do not have.
I have been very pleased with the anti-virus protection this product provided.
I use turbotax every year. it works and does what I need.
Great
Awesome app all it is ready for your business and tax
"Turbo Tax Deluxe + State - As purchase time came around, I was happy to see it advertised through Amazon at a better price than directly from Intuit Turbo Tax.
I had previously purchased T/T from Intuit on the automatic renewal option for several years.
My only complaint with Intuit;  Two years ago they forced me to upgrade my operating system that was not old.  This came with no warning from Intuit.
For a 1040 longform taxpayer,(8 years) T/T seems fool-proof."
"I would rather run windows ME.This is the biggest step backwards I have ever seen and I started with MS-Dos 3.1. I don't know what they were thinking when they put this together but they should all be drug tested. I may keep this on my computer for whenever I need a good laugh. I'm just glad I didn't buy 2 copies.
UPDATE: I have tried using Windows 8 for three weeks. If you are using it on a desktop computer save yourself the hassel and just reload windows 7. I never thought I would look at a Mac. but maybe its time.
If your thinking about buying Windows 8 my advice is JUST WALK AWAY."
"Great upgrade from windows XP. Updated a 6 year old PC, easy install, and would use it again if I had another  pc."
"I have used Quicken since it first commercialized. I upgrade every year. The community services are outstanding. Our daughter just got married, so I thought this would make an excellent Christmas gift."
my 6 year old grandson is learning to type not hunt and peck anymore-he does need supervision while learning as he will revert back to his old habits if I am not watching-the lessons are boring to him but he loves the games (typical)-I would highly recommend this to anyone to get their child started with good habits as such a young age
"I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE. IT IS TOTALLY UNRELIABLE AND COMPLETELY UNSUPPORTED BY APPLE. SINCE ITS LAUNCH IT HAS HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS. EMAILS LOST, NO FUNCTION. NO EMAIL FOR 5 DAYS ON TWO DIFFERENT OCCASIONS SINCE JULY 18TH AND WORST NO SUPPORT FROM APPLE. IT IS NOT A GOOD PRODUCT. SADLY A TOTAL MAC FLOP."
this product is at times confusing but it has all the tools you need to make perfect manga. everything about it is amazing!!
"I have been using Nero 2012 platinum and decided to upgrade to the new version. It installed without issue or overwriting of the 2010 version. I have not used it much except to see if it would open a couple of videos I made with the 2012 version which it did.

I like the new start page better than the old version  because I use 2 monitors in extended mode and this version has all the tiles on one screen where the older version showed them from the top of my top monitor to the bottom of the bottom monitor.

That is all I can say I have done with the program to date but it seems like it has all the features of the old version that I had used in it."
Great fun and a knowledge enhancer.
"Please note that this is the same DVD that Amazon sells, under the same title, with the book and DVD together.  I felt pretty bone-headed when I ended up with two of the same DVD!"
This product does not work as advertised. Every score page is full of errors. Many times a page will be deemed unreadable.  This program is a time consuming useless waste of money.  Don't buy it. You could get better and faster results by entering the notes by hand.
"My partner and I have been very pleasantly suprised by the educational punch these games carry.  The production values aren't the best and I get kind of irked at the wide range in volume levels, but they have been stimulating and engrossing for my daughter, who has been playing some games since she turned 3 and is now 4.5 and still discovering and learning new things.

Really, I've been impressed with her improved mouse and computer interface dexterity as much as with the specific skills the programs set out to teach."
"I updated my 2008 software expecting good things...I was wrong!  Software was incompatible with my web browser...I couldn't even register or activate my membership.  It appears that it works primarily with IE7 which has it's own problems.  I looked on the ""forum"" of [...] for problems associated with using different browsers, slow speed of downloads, and many other problems with the software.  I emailed Ancestry about a few problems but couldn't address my complaints...apparently, there are many other people who haven't had their complaints addressed from the ""Help - FAQ's""...a lot of suggestions but no real fixes.  I had downloaded an update and I couldn't get the program to work at all.  I had to uninstall and reinstall the program but before it would work, I had to go into the computer's registry and make some edits.
Another problem...automatic membership renewal.
Another problem...can't share your geneology tree with family on disk...can only share by printed matter.
Family Tree Maker 2010 is due out in Sept...I doubt that I will be spending my money on that one because they can't seem to fix the problems that they already have!...Kind of sounds like Micro*#@%!!!"
"Spy Sweeper found almost 80 installations of spyware on my computer when I first installed it.  This program still needs a bit of tweaking, but they keep updating it (maybe TOO often), however it's a good one.  While spyware may not actually HARM your computer like a virus, it definitely slows it down... a lot!  Spy Sweeper does a pretty good job of getting rid of unauthorized garbage on your computer."
"I have had problems with updates. Quicken asks if I want to update the software then tells me that my WIndows 7 64-bit OS doesn't meet their requirements.  OK then.  I tried downloading and installing the entire program but had no better luck.  Finally, I found their MONDO patch and that did the trick.  Check it out at http://quicken.intuit.com/support/help/quicken-2014-for-windows-release-notes--updates--and-mondo-patch-/GEN85883.html.  Pick ""Mondo Patch Update""."
"After reading reviews and high marks I ordered Bitdefender.  Three days after installing the program, my computer slowed down.  After opening a program I would have to wait as much as a minute for it to open and run.  This is due to Bitdefender scanning.

In short It's a program that should never been let loose on the market."
"It's still broken. Immediately EXITS when you try to synchronize it with any of the financial institutions. None of the ""fixes"" on the forum works either... not real happy about this but it's not a show-stopper..."
very user-friendly...
"Great, Thank you."
"Extremely disappointed with this. I cannot print a clear project at all. Everything comes out ""fuzzy"". Would love a REFUND!!"
The software was just what I need to upgrade my Mac.  The box was not in English but the software installation gave an English option so all worked out.
"Hi people,

I know ""high tech"" related companies frequently have the worst customer service/relations but Roxio, as far as I am concerned, really takes the prize for their exasperating ""Customer No Service"". I am beginning to wonder if it isn't Roxio corporate policy to be intentionally exasperating and screwed up so you won't [can't] bother them. Twice this last year have I been stiffed by this sorry company.

The first time was when I went to register their Easy CD Creator (Windows). Their website would not accept the serial number they gave me so I couldn't register therefore I couldn't download any Roxio software updates or even log in to there tech support forums or contact them in any way except telephone. The bad thing was later I when I tried to download virus software from another company, that installer said it detected a version of ""Easy CD Creator' that would cause problems with the the virus software and I should go and download the fix for Easy CD Creator before the virus software installer would run. So I couldn't use that virus software because I couldn't download the Easy CD update because Roxio didn't like the serial number that they themselves put on their product.

The second episode was in December when I bought Toast 7 for Mac and mailed in the $20 rebate forms and stuff. Today I received a postcard from them saying my UPC barcode didn't qualify. What the h%#&!? When I tried to contact them, I had to register but their new user registration page was totally blank. Finally I tried to register with them as a user on a different part of the website but that one told me I was already registered (somehow). When I I clicked on ""forgot my password"" It asks me what email address I used to register. How am I suppose to know... because I never registered! Then to get any kind of help whatsoever, guess what... you need to log in. But I can't because I'm not registered! So I try to register under a different name and an alternate email address. It somehow also thinks I'm already registered and asks me to just log in. But when I try to log in with my new name it says I'm not registered. What the f###! This whole rigamarole seems to be specifically designed to drive people crazy! Roxio's specialty seems to be catch 22's and do-loops.

Customers can not even send Roxio an email so all I can do is write a review here at Amazon. Sorry... Roxio is not the kind of company I want to have anything to do with. I don't care how ""good"" their software is or is not."
use it all the time
"This is a great set of games. They're hard enough that solutions aren't always obvious (even to the adult), but easy enough that with time and effort even a 3 year old can master them eventually. They're also fun enough that the 3 year old in question was more than willing to put in the time. In fact it was hard to pry him away from them. The characters are engaging, and there are a lot of small games internally that can be played regardless of what's going on in the larger game. All three are very good, and our son plays them all pretty equally, switching back and forth between them."
"I don't know what it is about these folks, but they have got the lock on putting together the perfect software instruction packages. Their instructional materials present complicated processes and ideas in ways that neither talk down to the computer literate, nor talk way over the heads of novices. God bless 'em.

I started learning how to build webpages by working my way through this series of lessons, and in two days I went from knowing literally nothing about Dreamweaver, or really about building sites in general, to being able to put together a pretty decent site. Like all things software, practice and repetition will make you a pro, but this is how it started for me. My success with this program led me to purchase their Flash tutorial, and eventually I became a subscriber to [...] online tutorial library, which offers top-quality instruction on dozens and dozens of software titles at a very reasonable price. I love it."
Not what I was looking for
"Been using Quicken for years - does everything I need in a tidy fashion. Upgraded to 2014 so I could use the app. It's decent, but not intuitive in how to enter transactions on the app. Particularly frustrating is trying to overwrite the payee - I type in the name and it reverts back to a predefined default, multiple times. Also it would be nice if you could change accounts when entering a transaction. If you are entering a credit card transaction, and then realize that you're in your checking account; you must cancel the transaction, open the credit card account, and start over. I do like the ability to add a photo of the receipt. Getting step-by-step instructions for using the app is very limited, and not helpful - I'm figuring it out by trial and error, and then trying to remember exactly what I did when it finally works. Overall like the app and, if I had it to do over again, I would make the purchase."
I am transitioning from Quicken to QuickBooks and I did need a bookkeepers help. Intuit migrated by old Quicken data seamlessly. Happy with the purchase.
Product CD is outdated and does not work with Windows 10.  But it will work with previous versions of Windows.
"Bought this search and find pc game for the holidays because my 4-year old loves I Spy books. He absolutely love it and me too! In a spooky mansion with different rooms filled with games and riddles, we had great funs exploring, solving riddles, and playing brain teasing games to earn clues to uncover the secret ways to get out of the mansion. Very happy with the quality and design of this brain building game. It works for my pre-schooler - have funs and learn i.e. words, spelling, problem solving, etc."
Watch which one you buy.  The original one I started with was free.... then they started charging for it.. and now they make you think you have to buy more than you actually have to buy.
"I use Norton Internet Security, but have been looking for a utility that would help fix some routine issues that were slowing my laptop down.  This seemed to work great and the price for three licenses was even better cause now I can use it on all of my home PC's."
Have use Norton for many years and this version so far is the best Norton. Great deal for 5 installation. Easy to install - just click & download.
"Putt-Putt Saves The Zoo is great for any child that loves animals. You need to help find the lost baby animals and find tools to help you along the way. I played it first to help find the tools. My 6 and 3 year old have fun finding the tools, animals and riding the water rapids. ( a favorite for both.) It is fun to play and my 3 year old can play independantly."
I didn't like it. It's a guimick.
The Streets & Trips - 2005 that I received was like new.  Received it in very reasonable time frame. I'm happy I ordered it.
"I used Mozy backup services for a couple of years. They made the backup, they took my money (too much in my opinion, but I had agreed to it). Fair enough. The problem with Mozy is that it installs tons of files everywhere on your computer that keep doing their thing long after you're ""uninstalled"" it. This thing is like a disease, I've never seen anything like it. I spent hours cleaning up my machine. Why--seriously, WHY--would any software developer ever think it's a good idea to design software this way. Bottom line is, I recommend Mozy like I recommend gonorrhea."
It's great
Has a little trouble getting started but then it was fun. Still haven't got the hang of sending things out to a group  Need some step by step instructions for that.
"To be honest, I'm a big fan of D.G. so my review can therefore not be complete objectively. Anyway, this dvd contains very good pictures of David's playing while his explanations are really clarifying his grooves and stickings. The songs he plays with the band are not only a fantastic extra, they make you see (literally) how his grooves make the funk work.

I also have his book with audio CD ""The funky beat"" from which the songs are being analyzed in this dvd. I can read the scores in there and the audio recordings of his drums on the CD's are very bright, so it's SEEMS easy to follow. Also his written instructions in the book are really clarifying all about the nature and background of the specific rhythms. Once you start playing, you'll discover it's a completely different game to make this sound even a little stable....

But this dvd with visual recording and David's spoken comments were very, very helpful getting my playing (more) consistent. It offers an unexpected insight in his technique and the direct link between sound and vision while he's playing, opened up a much clearer view on his approach of things. Maybe it's because of how my learning works but I noticed that my progress in playing D.G.'s work went steep up.

I'm not a pro working drummer and play for fun only but I enjoyed every second trying to get closer and closer to what makes D.G.'s grooves so virtuoso. I'm sure it will do the same for you. And myself, hmm, I still have a loooooong way to go....;-)))

"Intego has a pdf version of the manual that can you get through a support request.  It should either be included or more easily available.

The virus protections and options in this program are awesome.  But there are so many settings, many of which are new to me, that you really need a good manual.
There isn't one.
The documentation is web based and spread out over more than 50 different pages.  There is no way to search it for a term such as 'antivandal'.  The best you can do is go to every page and use your browsers search tool to try to find something.
For example: when setting up a scheduled scan you can select 'scan', 'quick scan' or 'repair'.  The manual, once you find the spot, says nothing about these 3 options even being there, let alone what the differences are.

A manual that you can't search is useless makes complex software like this almost useless."
Excellent item! I'm very satisfied!
"This version of final cut came sealed and all set to go. Installed quickly, no glitches, came with all the right registration and disks. Still figuring out how to use it, but after a few lessons and video tutorials I have faith that I'll catch on."
Its great
"Very good value and quite relaxing. Beautiful scenes and settings and well worth the price. Good good, good, goody, good !  ( o ;"
"without sync support, it's useless. say, I have a folder containing 1000 files, if some lost during the upload, that's a disaster.

if amazon provide sync, I'll buy for sure. but for now, I had to cancel after 24 hours."
"While I appreciate all the nice Desktop improvements they made, the start screen is just abysmal. I have been using Windows 8 since Developer Preview and its on my main laptop, and my main Desktop and I have given it a TON of time to try to ""grow"" on me.  But I just simply don't like it, it slows me down and interferes with my daily workflow.  Searching for apps in the ""Metro"" interface is a bit clunky, and often requires me to down key to Apps or Files or whatever, its not nearly as intuitive as it was in Windows 7. Also I really don't like the Metro apps, they are so overly simplistic they are just useless. Why would I use an overly simplistic Metro app when I can download a Desktop app that does the same thing but has a TON more features?  Doesn't make sense!  But not only that but Metro is prolific through the OS and constantly gets in the way, with the Charms bar that is just annoying it you mouse over too far, the new dialogs that go across the entire screen with the Metro color that doesn't match your Desktop color and look totally out of place.  This OS is just really an abomination that should have never seen the light of day!"
"I have two TomToms, but was looking for something that I could plan for the next day's trip on a larger screen, like a laptop. I thought this was the product for me. After reading the reviews of users of this product, I wil stick to the awkward touchstreen of my TomToms. Thanks for the great headsup!

My four year old loves this game!  It is just plan old fun for a little girl.  It was worth the money.
"Besides being unreliable when I had a problem and checked with customer service the first time with the embedded link I was told I would have to pay an additional $175 dollars for assistance.  No attempt whatsoever was made to help, just several times I was told I would have to pay the additional $175 for service. I'm certain I had the native Avast service, not some chameleon pretending to be so, I'm A+ Certified and have been servicing computers and dealing with customer assistance over 20 years now.
Additionally I paid full price for this software but I'm chronically getting nag screens to upgrade or buy more Avast software-several times a day. I'm going to try one more time to toggle off the nag screens but I most likely will remove the software from my machine. Instead of removing PUPs it is a PUP."
great Anti virus product.  I have since upgraded to AVG's internet security which is the anti-virus plus an excellent firewall.
"I purchased MasterCook 14 in March of 2015.  When I upgraded to Windows 10, a few months later, version 14 seems to run fine, but the program shuts down when I try to print.  The MasterCook solution is to upgrade to Version 15....at the cost of $24.  In my opinion, that is very poor customer service.  They should, at the very least, offer a free upgrade to anyone with the most recent version.

As far as the program, it is a good recipe fie and I was very happy with it until they made my version obsolete within a few months of purchasing it."
I have been trying to find a copy of this program for a while it functions better than Microsoft and provides features that I love with this program.  If you have every used SmartSuites before this version works well with Windows 7 haven't had any problems
It appears to be working well for me!!
I have used PSP for years and am very happy with its progress and new features.
We have used Turbo-Tax for several years and are very pleased with it's ease of use and the dependability.
Apparently it is different than the regular Corel Draw 7 so it is of no use to me.....because I can't use it with the program that I have that I bought it to go with.  Hmmmm......my fault....not enough research I guess.
One more year of taxes down fourty more to go.
No comments
i like this product is easy to use and fast .I recommend this product to all my family and friends.
I like this program so much that I just went and bought a cheapie refurb laptop just to be able to use this program once again. The $100 laptop can run this and other non-Windows 7 programs. Dear Bill Gates... stop messing with a good thing.
"Works great with my taxes, and is great to know you have a reliable tool for preparing my business taxes."
"This goes from strength to strength each year. If you want to save money and don't mind 3 hours in front of the computer (after you have collected all your W-2s and paperwork together), then this how to do your taxes.

Ability to save, change, edit at later dates prior to submission makes this a great tool for the busy people of this world.

Deduction finder was not as good as I hoped, though it did put me straight on most questions I had."
"easy as could be. For clean install on new laptop SSD, loaded just like that. No longer will I mess with OEM OS."
"The Norton is a great product and everything was okay I just thought that it came with a disk which is what I like having so was disappointed that it didn't. It took a bit to get it to work with just card but finally got it. I have used Norton since 1997 and wouldn't want another kind. Amazon did a great job with getting it to me quickly, box was a little squashed but since there was no cd it didn't hurt anything."
"I am a first year user of this software, having switched from many years as a TurboTax Basic customer. I found the software to be just as easy and complete as the old TurboTax Basic before they made changes in 2014. I am a happy new customer of H&R Block."
"Last year, after spending several hours I managed to get a proper return done for my 2-person LLC.  This year Quickbooks and Turbotax simply don't speak the same language.

Throughout the year, I make regular distributions to my partner and to myself.  I have tried booking those alternatively to our equity accounts or directly to retained earnings but nothing works.  Whatever I do, when I am ready to import the Quickbooks file into Turbotax the result is nonsensical.  Additionally the program does a horrible job of explaining the implications of the questions that it asks during the interview process.  For example, if you make special allocations to one or more partners it is nearly impossible to reflect that properly on the tax return and on the K-1s.  It is absolutely stunning that two programs which have been around for so long and which are sold by the same company could inter-operate so poorly.

The program flags discrepancies which are not really there.  For example some entertainment expenses are only 50% deductible.  Not surprisingly, once the adjustment to the book income is made, there is a difference between book income and tax income.  However, I have found no way to simply accept that difference and move on.  If the difference can be explained by the different treatment of expenses for tax and book purposes, why do I have to tear my hair out trying to trick the program into accepting the differences?

I specifically waited until late January to download the program, figuring that will give Intuit time to fix any issues.  As things stand now, I think I will simply download the forms from the IRS and fill them out by hand.  Unbelievable."
If your thinking of switching to windows 8 this is better don't bother. Just stick with win 7 until they come out with a PC version thats good..
"This OS was very simple to update on my intel iMac. I had no problems loading it in and no problems for the past weeks using it. It works very smoothly and is definitely an improvement over OS 10.4.9 (Tiger). The Time Machine alone, was worth the price of this system!"
I mainly buy this to help me e file but the irs rejected it anyway. When I called Block for assistance they were INCREDIBLY RUDE. Next year I'll use another software.
"Eset has been my go to antivirus since 2008. As an IT professional I have used ever single antivirus/security software out there at one time or another. For my own personal computer protection on my home networks, and mobile devices I use ESET. I have found that it catches things before family members create work for me that I do not need. The new secure banking features and online security education had made my life easier. Now I do not need to babysit everything going on in our home, ESET has become my little helper that lets me enjoy my off time, by truly enjoying being away from the computer issues."
"It has the tax forms i needed, plus multiple uses for other family members.  It is very easy to use.  Received it quick after ordering it.  Found it for less money than other sources."
"Installed this on a 2.6 ghz Pentium 4 Gigabyte system with 1.5 gigbyte DDR, two 160 Maxtor harddrives, and a Sony DVD DRU-510A. Took an image direct to the DVD+R and Ghost reports success.  Ran the Ghost image integrity check and it fails at 9% with data corruption. Tried this over with media Memorex DVD+R then Verbatim DVD+R. No luck, same results.  Sent in complaint to Symantec.  Got canned response saying the DVD drive is not on list of tested drives and to take a image to file and use other software to copy to DVD.
Took image to file on my other disk.  Ghost reports success so try to do the integrity check which fails with data corruption report again.  Maybe some bad memory on my machine, so ran memory test overnight (9 hours) with a stress test. AOK. Checked disk drives using utility from Maxtor. AOK.  Gave up on using this product so I used the program Simple Backup supplied with the Sony DVD which worked.
Conclusion: Ghost is not a product that I would trust for my backup.  What combination of software/hardware is causing the trouble I don't know.  Will go back to Symantec to complain and will report if I ever get satisfaction (money back)."
Don't buy it.  Required late download and froze up with 'not responding'.  Tried to get through chat and waited and waited and waited.  I will just throw it away and go back to turbo tax
It is not user friendly if you are not IT savvy.
Awesome tool for collecting recipes.
great
"I hate this version but I have to have it for business.

Office was far better in earlier versions.

I loved Outlook in the past but this version is incredibly inferior.

Google makes simpler products that are much better.  Their free cloud space is much larger.

Their price is much better, too.

The annual subscription is $0.00"
windows 8 takes some getting used to but i really love it now that i have the hang of it.
"Best security software ever, and it's free!"
"Cool software, but Avid customer service stinks. Their only contact is a phone number and the first time I tried it nothing happened, the second I pressed 7 (this was unsuccessful the first time). Finally, after about an hour of looking, I received the answer I needed, it was however upsetting to go into my control panel and make everything on my computer display in microscopic size.

Be weary of Avid products!"
"Peachtree Complete (5 user) was always relatively expensive to upgrade, but it was nevertheless worthwhile to do every 2 years. A few years ago, as our small business grew to employ around 25 people we purchased the Quantum version for many thousands of dollars. So far, so good..... Unfortunately, not long after we got Quantum, Sage changed their business model so that every year you would have to bleed financially to ""upgrade"" your software. And the upgrades are pitiful for what new they offer.
So now, Sage has figured that as no one wants their expensive upgrades they are going to make the continued functionality of features which change annually (such as payroll) subject to exorbitant service contracts. This in effect means that if you don't upgrade or purchase an annual service contract for zillions, your software downgrades.
I suspect Sage is unwittingly engineering the demise of what is a good product. Some call it greed. I call it stupidity. My version, Sage Peachtree Quantum 2012, still does everything I need (as I never used the payroll function) so you won't see me upgrading to a newer version of Peachtree (sorry Sage....I love the word ""Peachtree""....those were the good times) until Sage's policies change. Before I succumb to Sage's extortion I would go back to using an abacus."
Ok.
Exactly what I was looking for
"Im retired, haven't paid State Tax in 10 years with this program said I owed $ 687.00. Tax account said ZERO!
The manual option did not work."
I love that this is part of PRIME. We use this feature just about everyday
"Good programe, can achieve most things, however I find that the older version is more versatile...strnagely"
Lots of tech issues.  Sometimes stops in mid-song.  Sometimes stops after 3 songs.  Sometimes runs flawlessly.  You'd think they have the resources to make it perfect . . .
"I enjoy using this product on long trips when I want a larger screen to navigate.  I used this on my trips from Philadelphia to Niagra Falls and Philadelphia to Washington DC without any problems.  I will say that the gps would sometimes not be recognized or at least pick up a signal sometimes when running the application so I had to restart the application and sometimes my laptop for it to work.  Not sure if that was just my computer but just reporting that it happened while using.  I like how easy it is to use and you can see lots of roads around you and not just what a small gps only unit would show.  I like the fuel calculating feature and the speed display on the unit as well.  Very happy with purchase because it is inexpensive and great to navigate from a 14 inch laptop screen than a 5"" GPS."
"I recently purchased a new computer with Windows 10 and absolutely HATE the mail app. It may work fine on smart phones but it was terrible on a PC and I was actually dreading using my new computer. I considered buying Outlook just so I could manage my email better but it is so expensive. Thankfully I found Mailbird on Amazon and downloaded it directly from the company website. It's wonderful! So easy to use and it has all the functionality that the Windows mail app lacks. I can empty my Junk folder all at once, I can view junk emails from the junk folder instead of having to add them to my Inbox first, and it's way easier to organize folders and move emails around. I loved it immediately and upgraded to the Pro version. I'm so happy to have finally found an economical email client that works like Outlook but is actually superior because the company's support team is so responsive to customer issues and seeks to fix and improve things immediately. Very very happy with this product."
"This game is fun and all, but it could use improvments..... Graphics for one thing but the most confusing thing is when you have to muck out the stalls everything is fine until u have to go outside and dump it then u can't get  back in!"
"I have been a Norton buyer for 12 years and consider myself a seasoned computer user.  I have tried different Norton anti virus products and decided to purchase Norton 360 for the second time.  The one big flaw that I see with this version is when I do a full scan, I am given a choice on what to do after the scan is complete.  No matter how many times I check the ""turn off"" feature, it will not automatically turn off the computer.  All of my previous Norton products would automatically shut down, but not this one.  This really needs to be fixed or remove the ""turn off"" feature so nobody is lured into a false sense of it actually happening."
Works fine for me. My state hasn't had an significant law changes that affect me. You might want to check with your state before you purchase an older version like this one.
"I had to call Chase (one hour) just to find out that they have not received from Quicken the 2013 program.  Then I called Quicken and after another hour I was able to get it to work with a work around they helped me with.  Very frustrating, but now it is okay."
"If you buy this with a Mac and expect a rebate, don't hold your breath.  I've tried twice and both times got stiffed.  I have heard from others that this is some kind of racket with this company - promise a rebate and then never send it.  If its worth it to you at full price, knock yourself out, but plan on not getting your rebate."
very good helps with home school
Love turbo tax! Easy to use!
Third year in a row doing my taxes with TurboTax.  It's great!  Putting together all the documents for a tax preparer is more work than just inserting the same numbers in TurboTax.  Very easy!
"I have used several tax software packages, but ultimately come back to TurboTax.  The easy to follow interface and accuracy of preparation are a plus.  Will use TurboTax again in 2012!!!"
"I tried to install this game on both a Windows XP and Windows 2000 machine and it wouldn't install.  I got the same error messages on both.  Vivendi Universal answered my e-mail with a ""we no longer support that old game"" response.

My daughter got it for Christmas - she was very excited and now she's depressed.  I hope I can get her something else."
"Before you buy this product please read the following.  People have been having a lot of trouble with previous releases of Poser and windows updates.  I am a poser pro 2012 user and have found that
Smith Micro pretty much leaves you on your own once a new version of their software comes out.
Now the big problem is that Smith Micro does not support Windows 8.1 and Poser Pro 2012.  For most the windows 8.1 upgrade shut down poser.  I was able to find a work a around (partial).  They released Poser Pro 2014 a little over 30 days after I purchased Poser Pro 2012.  I bit the bullet on that one.  I thought they would supply updates to their earlier products.(no)  If you do a search you will find that there reply is ""they do not feel obligated once a new software version is released"".  Well Poser Pro 2014 is off my list since windows is a very update intensive program."
No problems yet and we've used Norton for a number of years now.
absolutely the best.
This complete solution is great for my pc. It doesnt get in the way of what I do or slow anything down and gives me the peace of mind that all is protected. A great improvement on many of the other products I have tried.
"I was happy both with the product and the excellent customer support service. I had some issues with the key which were solved promptly and efficiently.

I would buy again from Tech for Less because of the great after sales service"
"A needed piece of software, but not thrilled with Microsoft on any level."
I use with Prime.  It is all I need.
"As ""the computer guy"" in my family and neighborhood, I am convinced there is no better. My experience with Norton goes back to the 80's Peter Norton days. Never, ever buy junk antivirus software. Norton outdoes the bad guys."
Excellent Product -- by far the best internet security I have found.  Does the job and does not bog down the computer.  Amazon has the best pricing.
"Did my taxes, don't know how well. But it did do them and got me a refund."
"I did not know what to expect when I purchase the 64 bit windows 7 pro. But to my surprise I could easily adapt my old programs to my new system by using the virtual pc machine (32 bit windows xp pro). It was installed with the windows 7 pro system. My motherboard was virtualization capable, but from what I have read even if my motherboard was not virtualization capable I could have downloaded the software. Any program that was not 64 bit compatible, I could install it to the 32 bit virtual machine. This is a very system. I like it a lot."
I hadn't updated my Quickbooks since 2005.  For a 9 year leap forward I expected greater changes than this has.  I think Intuit is focusing more on their monthly fee business and less on software.  It's still good and solid software and does all I need.  I was expecting a few more modern improvements.  There are some things that were counter intuitive in my 2005 version.  They remain.  It's simple and does it's job.  No complaints other than if Intuit is essentially making minimal changes over the course of 9 years they could sell it for under a hundred dollars.
I tried to get as many games as I can for my kids to play. Amazon.com is always the first place I will come to buy these games. Brave is a good game. I can tell that my daughter loves it. It is challenging so she spent a lot of time try to solve the game.
I like the download. My music when I want it. Thanks
Good price.
"Easy installation, just as advertised"
"I bought this for my 20 month old daughter in hopes of finding a simple, engaging program. Sesame Street's First Steps exceeded my expectations.  The features that I especially like are the Parent's initial choice between keyboard or mouse activities. My daughter gets to choose from 8 keyboard activities and four mouse activities. All of the activities have verbal prompts from: Big Bird, Elmo, Ernie and Baby Natasha. The graphics are better than the Reader Rabbit Toddler program. Now this is a very basic, cause and effect type program. The baby pushes a key or moves the mouse and they get immediate rewards. There is the option to repeat each or move on to another screen. My child especially likes the silly songs and ""Do As I Do"" activities. She gets to imitate hand motions to some of her favorite songs and learn new ones.  I am very pleased with this program because my child ends computer time happy, she can follow the directions (with adult supervision) and successfully complete the activities.

Parent Bonus: Once the program is installed you don't have to put the CD in to use the software!

The only cons are that when in the keyboarding mode, the Windows key will bring up your start menu in the middle of the game window. But most of the other  games out there do that too.
First Steps got it right--and I can see this being fun for a long time!"
"As an OEM builder and computer repair technician (and disabled), my experience was ultimately better than I ever expected.  The disc arrived very quickly, but for some reason it wouldn't load on any of 3 computers, using 2 external drives.

I contacted Sir Tanon and received an response immediately...I explained the situation, we talked about the high standards he sets for himself and my needs regarding my disability.  After a brief chat we were done.

Not only did he replace the disc (which he checked on 3 computers to be sure it loaded properly, he included another Linux system that I like very much and can install on computers I donate to students and other needy persons without it taking up much space, so they can use the older computers I tend to get to repair and upgrade.

I had no idea he was going to go so far to make things right (I understand I received the first disc of his ever to malfunction), but I'm thrilled.  I wish more people had such high standards, especially in business.

Kudos to Linux and to Sir Tanon for his gracious and professional response."
"If there was a Zero star I would give it to this product.  I will never buy another Intuit Quicken product again.  The project has issues creating the stupid Intuit ID.  WHY DO YOU NEED TO DO THAT?!?  More stupid features that just done work.  After this I'm moving on to other programs.  GnuCash or something else.  ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN THIS.

The problems continue.  Will start using MoneyDance after this garbage expires."
"We have a very small business, but the same processes need to happen as in a large company. Quickbooks allows me do everything we need related to our finances without having to hire another staff person."
"The new version of Office 2008 is totally dysfunctional. Problems:
1. No data analysis tools in Excel.
2. Crashes every 5 minutes.
3. Documents scroll very slowly even when running on a new iMac. Editing graphs is so slow it's like running office on a 10-year old computer.
4. Graphing functions in Excel are incredibly hard to find graphing functions like adding labels to axes.
5. Default view and graph styles in Excel are different than previous versions.
6. XML graphics generation is buggy and produces artifacts.

All I have to say to Microsoft is thanks a lot. Thanks for the most dysfunctional pos you have ever put out. There is good news however. OpenOffice can be downloaded for free and it's very user friendly and reads and writes all office document formats."
"So far, so good.  Easy install.  Hope it keeps me safe!"
I had a horrible time downloading it. On my desktop computer I finally got it do download but it says 2013 instead of 2014. On my laptop I still haven't been able to download it
I've used Webroot for years now and always purchase here for far less than the renewal rate. If you're used to the other sloooowww antivirus software Webroot will amaze you.
"Absolutely do not buy this product.  Upgraded to OS 10.9 and have had multiple crashes/issues with Norton ever since.
Attempted to troubleshoot with Norton help - was absolutely worthless.  Rep did not even know what a kernel panic crash was.
DO NOT BUY unless you like wasting your money.
You might as well strike a match to the money."
"I am one of those unsuspecting customers that buys the Deluxe version of TT at Costco as soon as it goes on sale with rebate.  I did the same thing this year.  I installed the program and downloaded the previous year tax return with no problems, just as expected.  What I did not expect, was that when I went to enter my K-1 income (I am self-employed, that's the only income I have), I was greeted with an invitation to upgrade to TT Premier!  Say what???!!!

So I picked up the phone and called TT customer support for explanation.  I was given a line about how it's a better product now than before, how it's streamlined across different platforms, etc.  I told the lady that I am not happy about not being able to complete my tax return, and she immediately offered to make me happy by upgrading to Premier version at no cost.

That is why I rated this product 2 stars - one for being deceptive to begin with, and one for CS effort to fix the problem.  I am tempted to tell my local Costco store to place a sign above the Deluxe version that it's not the same product as in years past.  I would also recommend to Intuit (and/or Amazon) to place warning on their site just below the name of the product:

 DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION IF YOU HAVE K-1 INCOME.  THIS FEATURE HAS BEEN REMOVED IN 2014 VERSION.  PLEASE PURCHASE PREMIER VERSION INSTEAD.

Finally, I want to state clearly for everyone reading that I do not object to companies changing prices/features/products.  It's a free market, do what you want.  Just be upfront about it!  I will be thinking really hard this time next year whether to purchase TT Premier to complete my personal taxes, or whether to give competitor a try.  I have been using TT ever since it came out, and money is really not a big problem, it's the deception that leaves bad taste in my mouth."
"While the software is easy to use. The fact that it works much in the same manner as Turbo Tax made it easy for me to transition to it after the pricing debacle Turbo Tax caused. However, I maintain previous tax returns as PDFs. Unfortunately, the only way to save a tax return with H&R Block is by using PDF995. Like most people, I have do not have PDF995 on my computer so I had to install it. As it turns out, installing that software is not enough. The PDF995 Converter also has to be installed. Users can only save their return as a PDF after installing both programs which involves pop-ups and sponsor ads. Do not buy this software if you typically save your tax return as a PDF because you have to jump through various hoops just to do so."
Works well and as expected.
"I'm one of the Windows Preview Program participants and have used Windows XP Beta 2, Release Candidate 1 & 2 and have been most satisfied.  If you're looking for an OS with the stability and robustness of NT/2000 and the compatibility of the Windows 9x family, your wait is nearly over.  Come October 25, you'll do well to upgrade to Windows XP!"
I've been a TurboTax (and Intuit) user for years. Very distressing and borderline unethical they changed the product to upsell people to Premier that otherwise don't need it.  Never a great strategy to devalue your product to increase sales. It may have worked this year..... but I will certainly be looking for options for the first time in two decades.
"I forgot Parallels slowed down my last iMac. Same problem now. I already had Windows loaded on this one, and I was going through Boot Camp already. I'm going back to that process until I figure out if it's me or Parallels that's slow. But the sale was ok, no problems."
Not compatable with my chromebook - oops
Wouldn't use anything else.
The product advertised that it worked on a Mac but it didn't and when I called Garman they said to borrow a PC because it wouldn't work on a Mac for my GPS model even though they advertised that it would.
"Pretty easy to use. I have only used it for basic video editing so far, when i get some more time i plan on trying out some other functions."
"Leaving this one-star review here to try to balance out the blatant shills. I'll edit this with a thoughtful and informative review after I have had time to use the software.

If Intuit needs to create these fake 5-star reviews it kinda makes you wonder about the quality of this version."
"I expected to be able to continue tracking my expenses as I had on various versions of Quicken for Mac for over a decade. I found Quicken for Mac 2015 useless for that purpose and asked for a refund. It's advertised as having ""a 60-day money back guarantee."" To get this for your download, you have to mail a refund request directly to Intuit and wait for them to send you a check."
For years we have used Turbo Tax for ourselves personal income and for our elderly parents.  No reason to change as it has served us well.
I got this system mechanic based on a review in one of the computer magazines.  It had high ratings so I bought it. I have a few problems once in a while. Called IOLO about an issue. they said they would take care of my issues for $$$$. It wasn't much at the time. This company is HORRIBLE to work with. All over seas operators who know little about cleaning up computers. One instant IOLO was cleaning and the operator went to lunch and didn't come back to finish. Another said to change browsers that system mechanics may not work on the browser I was using. Firefox was mentioned. Tried that and it was worse. Called back got another operator who knew less than the first one. I said I wanted to cancel my order. Sup said I still needed to pay $99 for the work they had put into my computer that still was not running correctly. All setting had been changed so nothing was working as well as BEFORE the call. Call me stupid but a while later i called IOLO to help with their system mechanics and wanted to charge me another $$ for looking into the computer problems that the program should have been solving. They were not accomadation nor was customer service kind. DO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE if you expect stand behind their product.
"I can't believe they released this software. I was pretty excited about getting this because it was hyped as being such a great improvement over Quicken 2007, but it truly sucks. The preferences are totally lame, for instance I really want the register to have the latest transactions at the bottom like it always has, but in this version it's totally opposite and you can't change it. They might as well have saved their energy on providing a link to preferences because there is nothing to choose from!

And entering transactions is completely non intuitive. You even have to put a MINUS in front of a transfer and doing transfers is HORRIBLE. I had to look up how to do one and it barely works right.

All backups are manual. There's not even an option to have it ask you if you want to back up (like it did and maybe still does in the Windows versions).

I wish I hadn't purchased this and tranferred all of my data from Quicken 2007, but no big deal, I can just re-open my old version with the last data file from it. This software is NOT ready at all.

I have asked for a refund, it's not worth the money and it's another total shame (sham) from Quicken. They need to hire new programmers. Very unhappy with this."
"As others who have posted here have noted, Microsoft has discontinued Microsoft Money. However, if you have used Money for many years as I have, and like the product, you don't have to move to Quicken.  As of 1/31/2011, Microsoft will discontinue online support for Money. That means you will be unable to have Money update your stock and mutual fund quotes or financial transactions automatically. However, you still will have the ability to continue to import OFX or QIF type files that some financial institutions still offer for downloading.

Additionally, Microsoft Money is offering a FREE version of Money Plus Sunset Deluxe and Microsoft Money Sunset Home and Business for both current and new users. I believe the only feature missing from these Sunset versions is the online updating. The FREE Sunset Deluxe version can be downloaded here:
[...]

Finally, free tools have been developed that replace Money's online updating. These tools enable users to update stock and mutual funds and financial transactions, as Money previously did. Consequently, both current and new users can use Microsoft Money for many years.

For more information on the continued use of Microsoft Money go to the Microsoft Money Forum here: [...]  This is a terrific forum if you need help for both current and prospective users of Microsoft Money.

Here is the link to the tools that enable users to update their stocks, mutual funds and financial transactions:

"At the time I am writing this review I have only used the graphic design, vector illustration, website creation / file management, and a little of the Flash capabilities of this product. I have not yet started using the video editing functionality.

My standard tools for this sort of work have been Adobe PhotoShop, Dreamweaver, Illustrator and some ftp tools. I found that everything which I have done with these more expensive tools was easy to do with CorelDraw Premium Suite X5. A couple of highlights include:

 - Corel Capture. I use screen shots all the time for user documentation, etc. The Corel Capture software that comes with this package offers some handy ways of capturing screen data, as well as content from other sources. It can capture other content such as video playing on part of your screen. It is a handy tool in general.

 - Corel Draw is their answer to Illustrator. Illustrator and I are not particularly close as I lack a skill that is key to its successful use - artistic talent. That being said, Corel has all of the tools that you would need to make the full range of vector drawings and art work you can do with Illustrator. I have a feeling that Adobe is always a year or two ahead in functionality, but Corel then works to add features pioneered by Adobe.

If you are a casual user of the various tool sets offered in these packages, Corel can save you a lot of money without sacrificing functionality. On the other hand, if you are using these types of tools at work and everyone else it running Adobe apps, chances are that you are going to have to stick with Adobe so that everyone can use the newer features."
"To be blunt I think most people's success with this, and there is definitely success to be had, is going to hinge on how committed they are to simply doing it.  The audio and video segments were well done, I could take or leave the rest, but the problem I ran in to time after time was simply how hard it was to focus on the material outside of a classroom type environment.  For all the years I hated taking Spanish in high school and college I finally felt a little bad for ol' Senora Barrara for being such an insuferable jerk.  Oh how I wished while going through this that I could raise my hand and ask a question, or request something in a new context, but my desperate cries went unrequited.  I would even go as far as to say a *gasp* dreaded workbook would have helped a lot.  Joking aside it's tough to sit down and put the work in to this but if you do you will indeed learn some Italian.  I have yet to be put in to a scenario where I can truly put the fruits of my labor to the test (Palermo for work next year!) but I feel confident that I will not be doing the de facto tourist maneuver of clumsily stumbling through a phrase book ever other word when I finally hop over the pond.  Overall I'd recommend the program and most certainly at the price being asked.  Much cheaper than other software and certainly more cheap than a college course + text book."
"Been using Turbo Tax for 10+ years.  Super simple.  Free Direct Deposit.  Cheaper than the CD-ROM.  And you can save it in a folder on your PC.  If you live in Illinois, don't bother with paying for the version that includes state unless your looking to find additional write offs, etc.  I f your return is simple, you can E-File online for free on the states website."
"I got this because I had to have a solution to create a memorial video for my Father-in-law.  Long story short, it ended up doing the job, but I had to give up making nice things like labels and text and whatnot because it took so long to get everything else working right.  And I had the devil's own time getting a DVD burned...don't know if it was my drivers or what, but I finally got one successfully burned by copying over an ISO to another system and burning it there.  BTW, the default music for the menu screens are really loud and really awful!!  I would have changed it, but nothing I could do to get a second disk burned.

Quality of the video was really good, though.  No complaints with the output.  :)"
"Still can't figure how to use correctly, had previous version and it was easy to use, this version is for the birds."
Thanks!!
good easy to use product
"Just received my purchase of Garmin City Navigator NT micro-chip for Spain/Portugal 3 days prior to departure for Spain.  Placed the micro-chip in my Garmin nuvi 1350 and attempted to test whether it will take or recognize addresses in Spain.  Tried my hotel/resort address. Nope! Tried the international airport in Malaga, Spain. NOPE!  Can't find on internet any Garmin or other instructions on how you are suppose to enter the very lengthy Spanish address thinking I'm doing it incorrectly???? Nothing on that either. Not too sure the Garmin City Navigator NT chips are a good purchase at all. Hope to figure this out, soon!!"
"Not only is this software reasonably priced, it has the most user-friendly functionality of all the different software I have tried. Very easy to import a picture and create your own chart, customize it or build from scratch. I am having so much fun dreaming of new projects and designing patterns for my friends. It is like coloring for adults!

The software developer is very quick to respond to questions or bugs you might find and once you purchase you get all the updates as well."
"Never got any viruses that I am aware of while using this product.  Very bloated product, will look to switch to something else when my subscription ends.  Also I think it is cheaper to but the product that it is to renew the license."
"This made my filing really, really easy by providing guiding questions. I docked it one star because I found that it didn't provide great quality help when deciding if I needed to file two state tax returns (I had moved at the beginning of 2012, which gave rise to this question)."
It couldn't be downloaded & the Microsft customer support staff were unhelpful.
thanks

"There is everything to love about this program.  I use two Macs, an older G3 and MacOSX8.6.  I wanted to carry the program over into my newer machine.  GREAT for speedy creating!"
"Pros:
Easy to install
Cons:
Everything else-not as easy to use as Nero Suite 10, Wave Editor/Sound Trax that allowed editing and enhancing music is gone. Have to go through multiple screens to do things as simple as ripping a cd. No support -have to pay a per minute charge to talk to someone at the company."
Finding is a little clumsy to use.
ok
"I need help on this game . I'm stuck when you have to get ginger's birthday prestent for  this guy.

  can any one help me???????"
"The box to this software says it runs on Windows ME, but it does not!  I had the older version of the software, but when we upgraded from Windows 98 to Windows ME, it no longer worked.  So I was thrilled to see this update which claimed to run on ME.  Well, when we installed it, I had the exact same problem as with the older edition--there were no contents in any of the folders!  We have a second operating system on our computer and were able to install the software on that.  As far as contents go, this is a great software!  Very cute scrapbook pages and ideas.  Just beware that it may not run on your operating system!"
"Lousy?  Where is the product? Was it because I had an expired account from a previous Norton Security?  I used the ""put in your product code"" on the download box, put in my product code then, apparently, the product faded away with my money."
"I would second David Cotter's positive reviews.  I only have a mere 20 years of development experience starting with a NeXT cube I bought back in 1990.  Today I work for a 200b financial services company that runs twelve 10.4 Intel XServes.  We are very cautious to upgrade as they machines are heavily used for production work in the marketing and reporting arm of the company where we heavily use Perl, AppleScript, shell scripts, Python, etc..  There has been perhaps 1-2 anomalies on individual machines that we had to reboot and do some repairs for - in perhaps 6 years of heavy use.  We have hundreds of Windows, Solars and Linux servers, VMs, blades, network servers, you name it.  Our 10.4 server reliability compares very well with the rest of our environment.

It was based on this experience I evaluated Snow Leopard Server by creating a Parallels 5 virtual machine on my Mac Pro desktop machine at home.  I honestly wasn't sure it would work on a VM but I was running a live wiki/blog/calendar with people live connecting from all over for 2 weeks.  There was one crash across a week of work - but I put my workstation running the VM to sleep several times and one of them the server didn't seem to wake up from correctly.  That's tough environment for a server.  I was very impressed with the improvement in management tools and the wiki is actually much better than the average wiki - my technical team that was testing it gave it rave reviews for usability.

I was so impressed that I decided to buy a Mac Mini Snow Leopard Server for my home.  We aren't ready to upgrade at work yet - that will require several months of testing with a set of development servers.  But based on my initial experience I would expect the testing to go fairly well.

I'm writing this somewhat preliminary review because that first guy was spewing hatred without any concrete facts and that's just rude.  The fact is that with running a web server, blogs, e-mail, dns, open directory, file shares, etc. is very complex.  Unlike reviews of simple products which might approach objectivity in some sense, complex products like server software can't be reviewed in an objective way.  Reviews of OS X Server are going to be about how combining one particular guy with OS X Server for a while worked out.  Apparently not very well for that first reviewer.  My experience has been overall very good.  Could be that the first guy is dumber than David Cotter or I, but it's probably because the kinds of things he was trying to do were not working out for him and the solutions were painful to find, if he could find them at all.

I understand this.  Apple does not invest in the enterprise at all.  The problems I've had with OS X Server are probably more difficult to resolve than on other platforms because of Apple's lack of interest, and the fact that far fewer people travel the OS X Server path.  This results in far fewer hits in Google on your problem than you would expect with a Windows Server problem - tons of people have problems on Windows servers.

So here's my recommendation.  If you are a computer novice that barely knows how to click a mouse but for some reason wants to set up a web server or wiki for your little company - OS X Server is DEFINITELY for you.  It's actually ridiculously easy to set up most of the server features and if they work, which is likely, you are going to be very happy.

If you're moderately technical: 2-10 years of experience working with server technologies, or have a lot of experience but you just aren't that good, then you probably want to use a Windows server technology.  You'll have lots of support, lots of stuff on the web, a broad range of software solutions, and there is a contractor around every corner that can help you out.

If you have a ton of experience and the most daunting technical problems don't really phase you any more (they might take days to fix, but they don't phase you), then I think you will really like OS X Server.  You're going to need all that experience because Apple, or the few other OS X Server users out there, are not going to be able to back you up much.  If you combine this experience with the right kind of use then OS X Server is a joy to use and is highly recommended.  Hope that helps."
"I've used other so called ""antivirus"" programs however someone told me about Vipre, and this is one of the bests programs I've used and I have an Apple!!!  And yes this program blocked a virus on my Apple!!"
"My son installed this upgrade on my back up computer which had Windows Vista on it. He said it was easy as pie. I love Windows 7 because its like XP on steroids! I have had no problems with it what so ever. Its easy to navigate around, fast and I highly recommend it to anyone considering dropping Vista."
"Pleased with product, disappointed with Amazon. They are abandoning a small town and leaving many, many good people unemployed."
Works well for home setting
"I have used older versions of QuickBooks in the past. This version has added additional features, making it faster and easier to use. Bundled with the QuickBooks POS software, I have a time saving system that allows me to spend less time on bookwork and more time running my business. QuickBooks has a great support team, willing to help with any issue."
"I do freelance bookkeeping and payroll for a number of clients, and the old PC I was using for work finally gave up the ghost.  So I decided to get VPC instead of a new PC, as I really prefer my Mac, and financially it made sense.  The program I'm using VPC for is Quickbooks Pro 2004.

My computer: Rev. A Flat-Panel iMac, 800 Mhz G4, 768 MB RAM, OS 10.2.8

The installation was incredibly smooth and fast, which pleasantly surprised me.  By default, VPC wants to install Windows in your Documents folder, which seemed bizarre to me, but I installed it in the Applications folder with no complications.

Things started to slow down after that point.  Setting up Windows took *forever* (as at that point I was on the ""virtual"" machine, which for me runs at 233 Mhz).  The good news is that when you finish a session in VPC, the program saves Windows' state (as if it were hibernating), so the next time you don't have to go through the interminably long process of waiting for the virtual machine to boot.

I encountered trouble when I tried to print to my HP 920c, which is a USB printer.  After doing some googling, I realized there is an update patch to VPC (7.01) and after installing it, printing works fine.

As for using Quickbooks, it's really quite responsive and I have no complaints.  It's easily as fast and stable as it was on the 5-year-old PC I was using, if not moreso.  I think the key to VPC is being realistic about what it is and what it's intended to do.  For my purposes, it's perfect!"
"It says frustration free packaging but I found the program frustrating.  My son-in-law is a computer whiz and I would have been lost without him  It blocks too many things and kind of ""takes over"" the computer.  I think it is probably better for businesses than personal computers."
"Previously I used Microsoft Money 2000 and attempted to switch over to Money 2005 but what a nightmare!!!!  I uninstalled Money 2005 and swore off money programs all together.  However, I recently bought a PDA and wanted to use it to track my finances.  I read the reviews and there are a few items that I would encourage you to look at if you are going to buy this product:

1.  Is your bank on the list of 2000+ banks

2.  Does your bank charge to download Quicken files

One of my banks that I have savings in is not on the list but this is no big deal as it is a savings account that I don't touch.  And my primary bank does not charge to download Quicken files.

If your good with this than this is an awesome program.  Easy to use, well set up, only as many bells and whistles as you want to use but no so confusing that it negates it basic purpose.  My faith has been restored in money programs.

Furthermore, I also purchased the Pocket Quicken, which was just as easy to install and use.  I highly recommend these programs."
"MS Office OneNote 2007 actually does what is says - keeps all your info close at hand and so easy to get to.  The notebooks that come included in the program are a snap to personalize, and taking a screenshot (or Screen clippings, as OneNote calls them) is finally easy.  I started out looking for journal-writing software, and I came away with a whole lot more.  As a writer, at last I've found a way to keep all the research (pictures, web-pages, ideas, scribbles) for my books (yes, plural!) available to hand, whether in a different section of the notebook currently open, or by using hyperlinks to connect to another section or notebook.  (And I highly recommend downloading the separate Word Count PowerToy.)  Included in the software is an extremely useful HelpGuide, a complete notebook on its own.  You can even make new pages or sections in the Guide to include your own tips.  (I do have to say, though, that the Help button found in the top toolbar is totally worthless.)  All in all, this product is definitely worth the money."
A good deal!  Working well so far...!
Parallels runs Windows 7 Pro very well. I can run some legacy Windows games I cannot use on my Mac. Old games is really the ONLY reason I even consider using Windows.
Unfortunately support is non-existant for this product.  Forced to email them as they have no phone and they do not reply.
"I started using this software tool June, 28th. Before that, I took some lessons but never believed myself capable of playing an instrument. I thought my ears were plastic and my fingers were wood. Today, after 250 lessons and two months and a half, I am playing. I put about an hour daily. More or less, one song every day. At the beginning of each lesson, computer feedback is 50 or 60% but it improves faster to more than 90%. Once I get more than 90%, I consider that lesson learned and start next one. The feedback provided by the computer every time I play is tremendously helpful for a better try. I have played in public ""country gardens"", ""piano man"" and ""heavens door"" in a satisfactory manner. Thanks to emedia! I am now planning moving to intermediate level, which also looks like an amazing product."
"I have given this product a ""1"" for lack of a lower number.  It is really bad. The presentation is so cheap-looking that it is obvious cutting costs was the most important thing considered by the company. I could not find exactly what was on each CD by just looking at the packaging (as was the case with another version) because each one was packaged in a generic sleeve (white, no print) that did not specify what was on each particular one. There was no manual either. Easy to use? Don't believe it.  I have Windows XP and I felt it was not REALLY compatible.  I called the company and sent e-mails requesting assistance in installing, etc. and I never got a response from them.  Bad product, worse customer service.  Another problem, which they do NOT mention when they advertise the number of graphics (over 1 million)is that you have to subscribe after a year to have access to that many.  That, to me, is false advertising.
I had a previous version and was happy with it (gave it away when I switched to Windows XP as it was not compatible), but I will never buy another product from this company.  I just bought ""Art Explosion 600,000 Images"" by Nova Development Corporation and it is very nice. What you see is what you get--600,000 images, no membership.  It comes with a nice, hefty 1,300-page printed image catalog.  IMSI, if you read this, remember, customer service and a good product are the reasons why companies stay in business."
"I was sent to the seller ""Tax Software"" and they don't even speak a language I understand. Plus, they wanted to remote control my computer. I think not!  They were no help. Nortons took care of me after I spoke with them. They even gave me more than I asked. I would not buy anything from this company again."
"I have used this program for over 4 months now. It works much better than version 6 which had alot of bugs in it. I have used Mcafee Virus scan since the early 90's. They have really improved it over the years. This version has a built in firewall program, which is really nice since I use a cable modem to connect to the net. It's very tight, it will tell you what programs are trying to access the Internet. You have complete control of what you allow and not allow.  In the beginning it's kinda annoying, because you don't really realize how many programs you have try and access the internet. But once the config process is over or completed for the programs you have loaded and use, it's not so bad.
I use eudora for my email client and it has caught so many email viruses it's not funny. I don't even think about the updating my dat files now.....because it does it automatically. I used to be very careful about updating it but now it's done for me and that's one less thing I have to think about.
I find it to run so much smoother than version 6, I was about to switch to Norton but I got a good deal with amazon and just tried it one last time......they fixed what ever it was in the previous version that was causing it to hang up and slow down my machine. I guess the biggest reason I wanted to stick with Mcafee before I jumped ship was that Norton charged after one year of dat files. Mcafee still works after one year without having to buy another subscription.
I like it and it works for me, so I say go for it if you need a good virus detection program and built in firewall."
"I have used printmaster platinum for several years and loved it. However THIS particular version 18.1 SUCKS BAD......Hate it. It has caused me nothing but grief, out the window with it....."
"so, why the positive review? It took me about half an hour to learn how to edit with this program. I may have to edit and update this review if I figure out how to navigate better. The biggest flaw is there isn't a pause button like Sony Vegas has. The pause button is what really made editing for anyone easy. The tutorials don't explain how to edit well either. I think Magix is missing the bus with this, and I know they do read the reviews, and respect the fact that they don't put out fake ones.

From my point of view, I see the 3 biggest flaws with this software are as follows:
1. THE NO PAUSE BUTTON ISSUE
2. THE HORRIBLE TUTORIALS
3. NO SETTING MARKERS TO PROJECT LIKE IN VEGAS
In fact, I've even watched tutorials online by YT users, and saw that they edited by hitting the plus button to pinpoint an exact point to place the marker. The best way to teach others how to edit is by using the ""Set Chapter Marker"" Button(as well as using the plus button on the bottom right). After you get the exact spot by moving the marker, you can easily use the razor blade to either remove start, remove end or split. The ""Set Chapter Marker"" is everything you really need to know
because you can edit right at that point. The fades are varied as well, and are extremely user friendly.

Post editing: If you go to the help menu, you can download FREE menu templates, so when you pop in the disc, you can see a nice presentation with video movement and music. There are a varied assortment of templates, and I like them very much. They are very professional or fun looking depending on the mood you're looking for.

MP4: I mainly use this program to edit with my Kodak Playfull and Kodak Playsport. I have an older version of Sony Vegas (6.0), and have read in a couple of places that the newer version of Vegas has the same problems with MP4, as the older versions. I have no way of verifying this, but this is the main reason I went with Magix.
I'm very very happy with Magix, although during the first half hour I was extremely frustrated. If you follow my advice from this review, you'll save yourself a lot of heartache. It really is great editing software.

I'm going to edit using the Storyboard. I will update with my findings."
"While Quicken seems to be a reliable program, I have had a hard time getting used to it after using Microsoft Money for ages. It is not as easy to navigate and I can't figure out where everything is. There should be a user guide for those converting from microsoft money to make the transition easier. Given time, I'm sure I'll get used to it. I still need to figure out how to use it for my small business."
"BEWARE - Missing information in description! We were recommended this by our son's teacher. After looking everywhere for it, we bought it here. No where does it mention that the program does not work on newer OS (Windows 8 and above) and Mac OSX. Now, we were told that we can't return a $70+ CD that does not work on any of our laptops (PC or Mac). Horrible customer service. This should be clearly stated in the description!"
My installation DVD was blank and now I'm having to file a ticket to try to get it figured out.
"Great product, price and fast delivery!"
"It is on as I write, I play motion picture themes that fit the task... I have not begun to really explore more, but I will."
"This tax software transferred last year info to the current year and show me step by step how to complete this year's tax.  All the forms I need for the Schedule A itemized deduction were available from interest on home mortgage to charity donation were available to  help me get the max refund. The e-file was free and I could download state tax forms, also.  Great program."
Very versatile. Easy to use and much easier to use than Word. I tried to convert to Word as almost everybody uses it but I returned to Wordperfect and it has not disappointed me.
"I am utterly frustrated and upset with this horrible software.  I have wasted dozens of discs trying to use it.  It doesn't matter if you are trying to CLONE or COPY or using name brand discs, it hangs up, it aborts, in fact, it doesn't do anything it is supposed to do.  I am just trying to copy a disc containing my own video.  It has been successful once.  After that, nothing but problems.

I have never seen any software that is so bad in all my life."
"I payed for this item and when prompted to download it, there was an issue with my location which is in Jordan. I will have to contact customer service in regards to this order. I wish I would have known about this before making such a big purchase."
"I just bought a new cell phone and needed to xfer all of my stuff over from my old phone.  I purchased this for $29.95 from a place online and installed it on my pc.  It works as described!  I was able to xfer (copy) everything over without any problem.  Yes, it does make you jump through some hoops to enable it to work, but when I figured it out and followed the instructions and get both phones recognized, I was able to copy everything over without any problems.  Everything is on the new phone, and still on the old phone too (even though I won't be using it anymore since I no longer have paid service for it cause it's on a different network).  I highly recommend this product!!"
"Based on reviews, I purchased because I believed it was a must have.  I was wrong.  The instructor goes too fast for my liking.  Thus I repeatedly have to watch a video over and over to get a good understanding of the topic.  The dvd has not really been beneficial to me at all.  I could have saved my $50.  You won't be ""missing"" anything like I thought I was.  Besides, you can find pretty much the same teachings for free on the web (trust me on this one).  You would better be served purchasing a MOS guide in the areas you seek knowledge in.  The picture of the box is misleading since it appears you would be getting a bunch of dvds.  However that is not the case.  It is one dvd that covers all the topics.  Disappointed with this purchase."
"Can't do anything until the
DVD is copied to the hard drive...but this program does not do the copying...have to have another program to copy...I have a DVD I want to copy to my hard drive...thought this would copy and then if I needed to convert to put on my tablet for travel...but nope.  Wish it had said ""does not copy disks!!!!"""
"TurboTax does the thinking for you.  Simply gather your 1099's, W-2's and investment forms and follow the onscreen instructions.  It does the State Tax in seconds after completing the Federal.  It also guides you through the business deductions and home office expenses without a hitch.  This is my umpteenth time using TurboTax.  I also tried TaxCut but switched back after only one use."
I have used Norton for years and have been virus free.  Runs in the background and protects my computer.
"I bought iWork with the hope that it would replace my MS Office for Mac package.  It proved to be more reliable, which is nice because Office software sometimes has problems booting and will lock up my computer.  On the other hand, things we take for granted like one click saving of documents, well, iWork does not do that.  Some of the other conveniences that MS users have come to expect are either missing or not readily available.  I imagine that Steve Jobs does not think it is a big deal.  Nowadays, he is probably more concerned with his iPhone and iPad than he is with work processing.  So, I don't expect any improvements in the near future.  For those who are strapped for cash and who have a Mac, this word processor and spread sheet will probably get you through."
"There were initial problems with transactions disappearing and reappearing, but as time passed the program apparently made the necessary corrections.  Most things work well now.  The reports are not as good as Quicken."
"I would like to try a Kindle Reader to see if there is much difference in the interface. I feel it could be a bit smoother on the Win Book, but then again, for about the same price I have hardware that operates a myriad of Windows products for about the same price. Overall, I would say it works well on my Windows tablet and I would do it again."
"Once the game is installed please right click the game icon on your desktop or go to Start > All Programs > Find the game through there. Right click and go to properties once there go to Compatibility. Once there you should be able to select Windows XP Service Pack 1 or 2 should allow you to run the game and try again. If that doesn't work let me know.

This is a very old game that ran on Windows 95/XP, if you have trouble finding compatibility mode please google it also and that will show you how to do it. And it should run the game no matter what."
"Purchased this software and attempted to install on server the access key does not work and the software does not work.
visited their website, and then is when I realized that this is not legitimate company they have no contact information. to contact them you have to first purchased a support plan who knows what your getting for that, again the product does not work stay clear of this item, don't waste your time or your money I am so upset at the moment how could amazon allow these people to sell this crap through them. This is Fraud, how can you sell this crap it is obvious now that if you do publish your contact information you are not selling a legitimate product. Buyers stay clear.it is not even worth the one star I gave it."
I LOIVE IT
I have used Quicken for 17 years to manage my family's finances and I am still very satisfied.  I would highly recommend it.
"Good movie for entertainment. Some of it could have been left out, but it is a Will Ferrell movie, so..."
Great product good price

I have found Avast to be a high performing antivirus software.
"Easy to use, does what it says, very useful.  Installs perfectly.  If you only take text notes, then this is a little over kill (with Spotlight and Google Desktop text files do fine for text notes).  The real strength of Notebook is multimedia.  Next version has drawing capability which will be a must-have (check the company website - you probably get a free upgrade if you buy this)."
"After a frustrating experience with H & R Block software not calculating my health insurance worksheet through their program, Turbo Tax got the job done with 2 day to spare.  Well done creating a clear and easy to navigate program."
"Yes, it might have worked to keep me secure. But I had A LOT of pop ups with and without the pop up blocker turned on."
Excellent antivirus program!  I recommend it to all my friends and family.
"Useless! I don't think any government agencies use this tool .It is completely useless I do not recommend it to anyone. If you lose files take your computer to a computer technician they will do a better job and you will not waste your money . I used to trust amazon , I do not trust it as much anymore many people get paid to write fake reviews about products . Do not be another victim do not buy it you will waste of money and take your computer to a repair shop."
"I used for this software  personal for all our computers.  I star used this software  seven years ago. I personally bought for family members and love it. It is very easy to use.

This product has a bug in it.  Don't buy.  You have to make if work every time you turn your computer on.  My firewall in my computer works better than McAfee.  Bad product don't buy
Great product.  Great service.
"We had tried other programs, but their complexity took away the fun factor, Crayola Creative Studio put the fun factor back in!
The kids really like the familiar ""feel"" of selecting markers and crayons that look just like their real physical ones, and they think that it is really neat to see how the tools(markers crayons etc) in the program work like ""real ones"". (IE, even children notice that texture, and colors blend and have different opacities depending on the tool, crayons are quite opaque, while markers are quite transparent etc.)
This software provides them greater creative flexiblity with the fun of being able to undo mistakes.
I purchased this when my elementary age children started to play with ""Paint"" (the very basic built in program on windows computers).
I had given them another program some time ago, but it was too complex so they didn't use it much, now the children ask can I go play with Crayola on my computer? I'm finding one of my kids nearly as excited about Crayola Creative Studio as the games they play.
(Tech note, the program installed easily on both of the children's computers with no problems, and was ready to run in a few minutes)"
This collection takes me back to high school in the 70's.  I read every issue of National Lampoon magazine during those years.  It was the only source for humor.  Sadly they could not publish that magazine in today's politically correct atmosphere.  See what funny is and get this collection!
"found it was incompatable with my current AVG Anti-virus software. keeping it to use in my other computer which uses McAfee that will go out of date soon. like McAfee-its fast, stays in the background and catches the problem right away-It's better than Norton!"
easy install.  easy upgrade.  performed as expected. slow.
"This software advised me that a free software I downloaded was actually spyware. It appeared to me that the software was just fine.  But upon removing it, my computer issues dissapeared. I had tried nearly everything trying to figure out what was wrong. I even had an I.T. guy look at my laptop.  His advice?, ""Buy a new one, it's 5 years old!""

This affordable FIX-IT software gave me my computer back!  Thank you Fix-IT!

The disc is easy to upload, software is easy to use, issues are easy to fix. I also used it on my desktop family computer and cleared up some minor issues that might have led to bigger problems later."
"I'm sure for most people that shop on Amazon, regularly, and know a lot about their format, this purchase is a no brainer.  I have been suffering with Vista on a couple of computers for four years now, and I was told that I should move up to Windows 7. I made a couple of clicks on Amazon and ran across this package and purchased it.  I really didn't key in on the term ""Starter to Home Premium"" or the system requirements of Windows 7.  I ran some software which showed that this computer was Windows 7 compatible so I bought this upgrade and it sat on my desk for a couple of months while I was too busy to install it.  After 4 hours of tortuous attempts to install it and about an hour with Microsoft Technical Support, who was also pulling our his hair, we discovered that this upgrade was not to convert from Vista to Windows 7, but simply to upgrade from  Windows 7 ""Starter"" to Windows 7 Home Premium.  Now it is worthless to me and I have to return it at a major discount.  I have no opinion about the package, otherwise, except to try to warn other unsuspecting and novice users, such as myself, into not following in my footsteps."
"Believe it or not, Vista seemed more stable, but I love the new features. Amazon had it a great price so I took the plunge. Now I can print from my laptop on one end of the house to the printer on the other end of the house. It's a better design than Vista."
"I don't know where silarski got his/her info (see review above), but Humonguous does indeed still make their software Mac-compatible.

I purchased a Mac Mini in May 09, my first Mac. Fortunately for me, the sales rep was a Mac person himself and was able to show me a few of the many perks of having this little machine.  MobileMe software was not included, but he was super cool and hooked up discounts and rebates if I purchased the Mini and MobileMe.  My monitor is being repaired right now, so my Mac is not directly accessible at the moment, but my iDisc is.  All of my documents, music, movies, pictures, and anything I choose to have on my iDisc is accessible through the online MobileMe cloud!  So, all my assignments I had saved for research papers can be uploaded to my PC!  Seriously, this software saved my butt!  If you are a Mac person, I highly recommend you invest in a mobileme account!  I purchased mine through Amazon for $61.00 flat, shipping, tax, and my new Individual MobileMe.  You can't beat that price anywhere, it's normally $99+tax!"
I absolutely love this. I have almost 100 books in my Cloud Reader and this makes it easy to sort them into different categories. I just don't understand why this isn't available as an app for the Kindle Fire. But in having it on my computer is better than nothing because I have access to my book while I'm anywhere as long as I have the PC with me. I have several different collections (categories). Mystery; Romance; Paranormal; Fantasy; Recipes & Cookbooks; Horror.. Makes it much easier to find the type of book I want to read next with just typing it in except for look in a library for the book for hours or having to get someone to help you do all this. My first book on this app was a great success in loading and convenience that i have never looked back to a library. Here online I can find any book a want with a click of a mouse. Nothing else compares to it. The download takes a little over 5 secs to be fully downloaded to your PC and boom there you have all you need right in front... Read more
"I own a later edition, FlipAlbum Vista, but see no difference in the versions I have owned since version 4.  The software produces very attractive computer based books of photo albums.  The pages visually and audibly fip and make a nice appearance.  The main problem is that the albums, although advertised as able to be made into DVDs, are limited to the computer.  This novelty wears thin quickly.  In addition, it's somewhat of a fraud that the software is advertised as being able to create DVDs that can be played on TV.  Yes, DVDs are technically created but the quality is so poor that they are virtually useless.  This is not a problem I alone have as the manufacturer's website is filled with complaints about this problem.  It's very odd since the flipalbums viewed on the computer are so nice.  But, there must be a problem with the software's ability to burn to DVD because the DVDs are totally useless as the quality is so poor.  Thus, there is very limited usefulness for this software unless you want to have the family crowded around the computer screen to view the result."
"I purchased the 2013 version about 3 weeks ago hoping to update everything and get ready for my taxes. Unfortunately, none of my splits converted. I spent hours trying to get a back up to another machine that had the 2010 version on it. I am still using the 2010 version and I hope I can figure out what to do for my 2013 data at some point. I am still working on 2012 taxes."
Got mine
Easy to down load no problems works good. I have downloaded programs feom Amazon before and always had good luck
"I downloaded the 2012 deluxe version to do my taxes, I used H&R deluxe last year after a bad experience, for 2010 taxes, at the local H&R block office where our tax prep professional didn't show up for an after work appointment that we had, then spent about an hour waiting while we waited for someone to help us off the street style even though it wasn't that busy. Our taxes aren't that difficult, i.e. about a dozen forms to enter and then a $280. prep bill.  I keep all our documents well organized paper clipping the w2's and other incomes together, and similar with expenses and deductions. No shoe box type filing system that they complained about.
Well back to this year's(2012) tax software somewhere while entering our info the software calculates a $214+ million income and the ""you owe the fed"" area lists taxes due of $60 million. I searched for a while and couldn't find any entry errors but totals still showed erroneous values. I called customer service and worked with a gentleman on the phone for about a half an hour. I uploaded my info and he saw the issue but didn't know how to solve it. His supervisor told him that they have heard of this issue and they needed to escalate my case. 'We'll get back with you within 72hrs, whats the best time to call?'.
Well they called about 120hrs later in the middle of the day, ignoring the best time to get a hold of me. leaving a message with the case number and 866 number, following it up with an email:
Dear H&R Block At Home Customer:

""Recently you contacted H&R Block regarding a problem you experienced with H&R Block At Home.  Your issue has been forwarded to the Escalations team, but we have been unable to reach you after multiple attempts.

Thank you for being an H&R Block At Home user.  We value you as a customer! ""

When I called them, I was guessing for a software patch or new update, but no I had to start over with the whole thing. They ""fixed"" the problem by having me delete several forms and suggesting that I review all my entry's especially past a certain point in the process.
The only positive part of the experience was the fellas on the phone who have to deal with frustrated, but very courteous customers. They were both friendly but obviously didn't have any backup support beyond going through my return line by line.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/H-R-Block-At-Home-Deluxe-State-2012-Download/dp/B00A42LWHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">H&R Block At Home Deluxe + State 2012 [Download</a>]"

"My current issue is Outlook locks up for no good reason constantly.  This has caused a bunch of interesting problems, such as when I try and synch my palm and outlook decides now is hard lock time.  I get this nice little message in the system tray informing me that outlook appears to be locked up or has stopped responding.  This is obvious to me.  Luckily I was mailed a copy of this from MS (I guess you buy 36 copies of Office 2000 Pro and they love you).  I have submitted numerous feedbacks, an average of 2 or 3 error reports per day, disabled com add-ins, etc.  As it stands Outlook has been giving me hell.  Also, the junk email filter, I don't know what logic they're using but it isn't half as effective as cloudmark or GFI.

I have been buying Norton products from Amazon for 3 years now. I won't buy any where else because the price blows everyone out the water. Download is ready soon as you buy it and never will be lost because its in your Amazon Download Center. Keep up the great work and prices low. Thank You
I feel like Intuit just wants to extract a few dollars out of you every year for the convenience of connecting to your bank. There doesn't seem to be any real features added - 2014 seems the same as 2011.
Good

"I recently purchased a copy of Toast Titanium Pro for my Mac. I use Final Cut Express to make HD movies and some promotional videos and had found FCE a little limiting when writing to DVD. With limited experience so far with Toast, I have already found it to give me far more flexibility in writing to differing formats in HD. Looking at what options it will give me, I am very confident that I will benefit significantly through its use in the future."

"I have used this software for 1 month now. All is well with it. The one thing I don't like is it asking the same questions over and over again on start up, even when I tell it to OK a particular task each time it sees it. (IP is trying to change my Home page)."
"My review for the PC is the same as my android phone >> I put this app on my smartphone (THL T11, yea you never heard of it but pretty good one) and have liked it so much that I now subscribe to Kindle Unlimited for $9.99 a month. Even as a prolific reader that I am 10 books a month is just about right. you can change the background to a beige with a font called ""bookerly"" and it is very easy to read. Turn the pages by swiping with my thumb and the light level and font size are all adjustable. Great reader, was using many others but this will pretty much read any type of book. mobi, pdf etc."

"I don't write a lot of reviews either, by the way, I find comments like that irrelavant to consumers so forgive me for even posting it. I have operated Iolo's System Mechanic for just over a year now.  I had no problems loading it.  I have no problems using it. I have no problems with the way it updates. I know just enough about my computer to know that if I start tinkering with it, in an attempt to make it run faster, I can potentially do more harm than good.  I can honestly say my computer runs better because I use it.  I recently renewed my subscription for two more years and was pleased with the ease of my renewal process. During the renewal process Iolo provided me with pertinent information regarding my account, on the screen, before I had to perform a deep search for it. Oh, I can still operate my previously installed firewall and virus protection with System Mechanic."
"Finally decided to take the plunge and move our quickbooks over from Windows to Mac. I had no idea what pain and suffering I was in for. The Quickbooks 2012 says that it makes it easy to import windows files, but I found that I had to go back and export for Mac to make it work. Once I did import I found that all my online accounts had to be re-set up and that I couldn't get them all to match what I previously had.  The worst part of the transition is payroll. If you use Quickbooks for payroll on Windows your payroll plan does not transfer. You have to close out your windows payroll and re-enroll in Mac. Trying to get this little bit of info took almost an hour on the phone with Intuit where I was transfered to no less than 5 different representatives.  The kicker here is that the payroll service for Mac is CONSIDERABLY more expensive than windows. For us this meant $60-$80 more a year for payroll services, an extremely high premium to use the version for the mac.

Many of the features in the Windows version aren't present in the Mac including the all important Accountant's copy.

I've begrudgingly used QuickBooks for years manly because its the only game in town. I've endured price gouging, incompetent support and technical issues.  Moving to the Mac was by far the most painful thing I've had to do with quickbooks and in the end I decided to scrap it and go back to the windows version. Really a shame."

"After reading some bad reviews i feared i would face similar problems. When i purchased i chose a seller with 99% rating and i was not dissapointed. The product was delivered as expected, relatively fast delivery considering that i reside overseas, tracking was updated regularely bu amazon and installation was a walk, very easy. Being a microsoft product, the packaging seemed cheap, no holograms, for a while i thought i got a fake product, probably MS cut down costs to come up with a decent price. Having used windows 8 pro during the last four years(even xp was better) i am sure i will be happy with 10. My account just got activated and the updates were installed, and yes it is the UK version but having used italian version previously(the pc i had was not available in english when ordered) i will have a better experience with the english whose words are shorter and more comprehensive. Five stars for the product and amazon service!"
"This learning cd is filled with a whole series of attention grabbing games and knowledge boosting activities.  The thinking process is definitely lit!

Our kids adore this cd, work hard to get all their chores done to see who can play it first, and have come to love science even more.

As long as you are willing to down load a patch, it works fine on Windows XP.

For those who are sensitive to how human biology is covered, the part on human biology is done appropriately.  There is a brief intro to what zygote formation is and that a zygote grows into a fetus, and they state that at 9 months the baby is born, but the cd does not go into any topics of human intimacy.  There are no inappropriate pictures or content.  The particular values of the parents are left in the parents' court to teach."
"This is a review of both the BaseCamp software and the US 24K West map data as used with a Garmin etrex Vista HCx on a Mac platform.  I've been using the old MapSource software and US 100K data for several years and I've also been using the National Geographic Topo State series software and data for a long time.  For working with the etrex, the BaseCamp software represents a significant improvement from what was available before.  If you have used the old MapSource software to load maps onto the GPS, not much has changed, it is just as slow and tedious as before - over 4 hours to load 4 GB of maps onto the GPS.  But, for route and waypoint transfer, BaseCamp works really well.  You can even drag and drop individual waypoints or routes back and forth between the GPS and the software.  BaseCamp shows a list of all waypoints, routes, and tracks on your GPS.  These can be hard to find on the GPS itself.  I'd accumulated a lot of stuff in my 2 1/2 years with the etrex.  Theoretically you can delete individual items from the GPS using BaseCamp.  BaseCamp tried but didn't work with my etrex - don't know if its a software bug or a GPS limitation.  I ended up downloading all of this data to my computer, organizing what I wanted to keep, deleting everything from the etrex using its menus, and then uploading the keeper data back to the etrex.  I could never have done such a chore with the National Geographic software, but BaseCamp makes it quite simple.  BaseCamp also allows you to create folders to organize your route/waypoint data.

OK, those are some highlights of my experience using the software, here are some pros and cons:

Pros:
  1) BaseCamp is a significant upgrade from MapSorce (especially for Mac users) providing excellent waypoint, track, and route exchange with the GPS.  If your GPS is plugged in, BaseCamp is talking to it.
  2) The 24K map data provides routable roads and many routable trails.  The 100k map data is not routable.  The 24K map data allows you to see combined elevation contours and routable roads.
  3) BaseCamp will create routes following trails and roads on your computer using this new data.  Of course the GPS can do this as well when you are in the field.
  4) BaseCamp shows you the map data as it will appear on your GPS.  It is simpler in appearance than the true USGS topo map copies that the National Geographic map data provide.  This is good or bad depending ...

Cons:
  1) BaseCamp uses the essentially unchanged MapInstall software to transfer maps to the GPS.  This is a slow process.
  2) There is a skeletal Mac help file for BaseCamp but no other instructions.  Plan on doing some experimenting to figure out how it works.
  3) The 24K install DVD installs a quite obsolete version of BaseCamp and the other software even if you have the latest already installed.  Plan on going back to Garmin's WEB site and downloading the latest software.
  4) I find the map data (all of it) to be cluttered with too much business POI data and so far haven't figured out how to hide it or delete it.  Show me the parks and peaks but get rid of all the little business people run from their homes!

The BaseCamp software is still quite primitive which makes it easy to learn but serious users will find it lacking.  With the exception of the Points of Interest data the maps are simplified for showability on a GPS unit.  If you want to print out nice trail maps, I would suggest using the National Geographic State Series.  For organizing and exchanging data with your GPS, BaseCamp is the best I've seen.  Even if you decide against the 24K map data,  BaseCamp will work with the older 100K maps and is available free from Garmin's WEB site.  I will continue to use both software sets for the time being.

A note on trail coverage: Another reviewer complained that the Skyline to the Sea trail near Santa Cruz, Calif was not shown, but should have been.  The National Geographic maps don't show it either.  I would suggest, as a general principal, that you should never just rely on your GPS but also have decent trail maps.  I hiked that trail several years ago and used the NatGeo software to create an approximate trail route.  Following the path in front of me and supplementing that with my GPS I did just fine.  On the other hand, last year I backpacked in the Dinky Lakes wilderness.  Those trails are all present and routable in the Garmin 24K data.  Using just the first and last waypoints from the route I created last year, the BaseCamp software created a route following the trail much more closely than my freehand attempt had done.  So a significant improvement but there is always room for more."
"The product arrived on time. It was installed  without any problems and it is performing very good. I would gladly recomment it

"I've been using Norton Anti-Virus in its many incarnations for over 5 years. Norton Internet Security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations. Even for computer super-heros it's a pain to maintain when there is a problem.
Bad:
Buggy program: I've had random Norton crashes forcing a reinstall of the product, not just once, but five times total on two separate systems. The uninstall/reinstall is a huge headache as others have pointed out.
Accounts: If you are the only user that logs in on the computer and don't have children using the computer, don't install ""accounts"" (or parental control). It's very buggy. You must be logged in as the Windows administrator and as the Norton administrator to make changes to the Internet Security portion, and even then it's hit or miss.
Privacy Control: The ad-blocking blocks many websites, some which you may wish to view. The screens to make changes are well hidden in Norton's configuration menus (here's a helpful hint: Privacy Control > Configure > Advanced > Add Site - type in website that has blocked features, check or uncheck desired features). Very unfriendly user design for such a popular consumer software product.
So-so:
Firewall: Getting better, hard to understand for basic users, not enough features for advanced users.
LiveUpdate is an essential feature to NIS. Symantec now charges an annual subscription fee for anti-virus definitions & program updates after the first year. The subscription implementation is one of the reasons it is so hard to completely uninstall the program.
Good:
Anti-Spam - Up-to-date and catches most everything bad. Norton Anti-Spam was compared in a major tech magazine column with other popular anti-spam technologies and won the editors' pick.
Anti-Virus - Extremely up-to-date. This is what they do best and continue to do it well. (Aside from the buggy program issues). Has paid for cost of subscription over and over again."

We found that her preschool at the time used a few of the programs for the kindergarten class and she had been using it for months as a pre-k."
"This has the best variety of photo objects of all the disks I've seen and is the only one of it's kind for a mac. I would look closely before purchasing more that one disk of photo objects. Every photo object disk I've seen is put out by Hemera (check the fine print), which I believe is now represented by Jupiter images, a very large stock agency. Anyway, most of the photo objects you could purchase from any avenue, including their subscription service, is going to be on this disk, which makes it a very good value. My fiance purchased some smaller collections for the PC and all were duplicates.

The images are a little small for any kind of large scale print work, but will work fine for web or smaller print formats, like brochures & such. The images usually need to be descreened in Photoshop before placing, but the embedded alpha channel is still a huge time saver, considering the volume of shots.

The browser is easy to use, and you can just drag and drop files into applications or into a folder for later use (will be a tif with an alpha channel). This is good because you can't really bust open the proprietary format the image files are in without using the browser. There's a small converter for pc out there that does it if you're a pc user, but really, no one will ever need to have all these files converted at once, and dragging what you need out of the browser app does it instantly."
"Last evening I downloaded Quicken 2013. The advertised mobile/iPad app is exactly what I've been hoping Quicken would add.
I have been using Quicken 2011.
Product installation went OK and it seemed to import all of my Quicken 2011 data OK.
When I went to update my accounts,  Quicken 2013 first wanted me to register the product.
So far so good.
After entering name & address, etc., it told me that I had successfully registered and gave me a button marked ""Finish""', which I clicked.
THE PROGRAM FROZE COMPLETELY.
I had to use Task Manager to get out of it.

I contacted Intuit support by email and sent screen shots of what I was experiencing.
This morning I followed up with their Chat support line.
I got responses from both channels saying that I should uninstall then reinstall in C:\Quicken rather than the default directory.
I was assured all would be fine.
I tried that. Twice. All was not fine.
Every time I got to the end of product registration, Quicken 2013 froze completely.

Adding to my frustration is that the 2013 installation process uninstalled Quicken 2011. I don't have the download to reinstall Quicken 2011 and if it's on Intuit's website,I couldn't find it.

So now I have a request in to Intuit that they 1) tell me how to reinstall 2011 and 2) refund my purchase of 2013.
If they can do that, I'll be back where I was, having lost only a day.
If they can't do that,  I will spit on their corporate grave.

Do not upgrade to Quicken 2013 unless and until you see through review in this forum or similar that they have released a useable product.

UPDATE (10/7/12): I still recommend holding off on Quicken 2013. But I do want to acknowledge Quicken Customer Care for trying to help me with 2013 and for quickly and courteously helping me re-install 2011 when I decided that was the best plan.  So, per my statement above, I do NOT spit on their corporate grave. I hope they can turn Quicken 2013 into a reliable product. I'll be watching the reviews here."

"Before we get started - I'm not an Accountant, nor am I a CPA. I'm a (relatively) normal guy who would rather do things on his own, rather than hire a CPA. Having said that, my personal tax situation probably wouldn't warrant a CPA in my opinion. Which is debatable. However, since this is my Turbo Tax review, let's get started.

I've been using TurboTax for years now. It is a good product (so far, no audits!) and has pro's & con's. For this to be a completely honest review I should be able to tell you that it is better than H & R Block's or TaxACT's software. I can't do that which is why I've rated this four stars. (As a side note, a CPA probably uses a professional version of some tax prep software ...our tax code is far too complicated ...which is another debate.)

I have used a various versions of TurboTax over the past several years: Deluxe, Premier and Home & Business. Depending on my situation, each version has helped me prepare my taxes and I believe has done a good job finding deductions and ensuring that I am compliant with U.S. Tax Law. This year I chose the Deluxe version.

Pro's - Buying TurboTax through Amazon.com came with a $35.00 off coupon for Quicken Home & Business (I rated it four stars as well.) Amazon's digital download is easy and installation and update of TurboTax was easy and pain free. TurboTax also does a good job of gathering information about you and offering advice - one of the big pluses for TuboTax. Be advised, however, that the process of entering all your personal and income information can be tedious. You'll be asking yourself, ""Another set of questions?!"" The questions are necessary and it really doesn't take as long as it seems. TurboTax is also constantly updating their software and the updates are usually a matter of clicking a button.

The Con's - Correcting mistakes can be a bit of a pain. I wished the software would be more helpful, or at least explain better as to why the number I entered this or that form doesn't jive with some other number on some other form. (Having said that, what exactly do I expect for $40?) Another con is lack of explanation even when I clicked on the circled-question-mark in some sections. Past versions of the software were better at providing a bit more detail than this version. Some explanations were obvious reprints from some obscure IRS form. In other words, no explanation or help at all. (I would bet money that there is an official government bureau dedicated to taking simple explanations and making them as convoluted as possible.) My biggest complaint is that for $39.99 you appear to get your federal AND state included in the price. Not so much. I did file my Federal return electronically, but there was a $20.00 ($19.99) fee for filing the state (Virginia in my case). I believe that TurboTax could do a better job explaining that. I took the paper route and printed my state return and mailed it in.

Overall, TurboTax does a good job and the Federal & State reviews usually find a few errors that are correctable - some more easily than others. I also like the ""Audit Risk"" section, as I can't think of anything more annoying and scary (at the same time) than an IRS Audit. The Con's don't outshine the ease of preparing your own taxes, however. Considering the price, the time I spend filing, and knowing my taxes are done, I am pleased with TurboTax.

One side note: You are rewarded for using TurboTax year over year. A lot of the tedious data entry can be eased a bit by using a previous years file. TurboTax will ask if you need to update, but at least the typing is done ...unless you need to update.

FYI - my standards for a 5 star rating:
5 Star Requirements
- Price point must be reasonable (I'd expect a $500 piece of software to be great)
- Must hold up to daily use with no (or very few) issues
- Must be easy to use, or set up (e.g., I don't have to sing while standing on one leg to get it to work)
- Must perform as advertised (none of this ""your experience may vary"" crap)
- Must have a bonus feature I find valuable

If you've found this review helpful (or not), please leave feedback. Would a bullet point list be easier to read than the paragraph style above? Thanks!"
QB for Mac 2016 has some bugs. It often suddenly changes the register account balance to a huge number. It appears to simply add all deposits and not remove debits. This seems to just be a display issue because quitting and reopening QB solves the problem.
"I was going to buy the Turbo Tax, however, after reading the reviews and seeing how disappointed people were, I decided to buy the H&R Block. The download was very easy on my laptop, Windows 8.1. I will write another review next month after I file for taxes."
"The best mapping program; I use it several times a week to plan trips, better understand things I read, etc. Easy to use. One feature I especially like is the distrance measuring tool."
"I have a love/hate relationship with H&R Block Tax Software Packages over the years.  While I certainly expect some difficulties in installing the software, this years' Deluxe Edition just would not install despite of several attempts, including H&R Block's Customer Support Solutions.  Essentially, you have to shut down all programs, via MSCONFIG, and run the install program.  All I could ever get was the intro message that tells me it was going to install the program and then it would be followed by the message that the program did not install properly.  UGH.  Sending it back.  Good luck to my fellow Block users.  You would think that an annual program, like H&R Block Tax Software, could be written that installs without incident by now.

***  UPDATE **  ***  UPDATE ***
I am somewhat stubborn and curious as to why I could not get this program to work and, just for the heck of it, I decided to go and try a different executable file.  I found it in the ""Installers"" directory.  From there ""H&R Block.."" executable file shows up:  simply make sure that it is highlighted and hit ENTER.  The program appears to have fully installed but the first update is not until January 8th.  If you are stuck like I was, try this approach, maybe it will work for you too.  I still resent having to work so hard to install this program but now I do not have to return it back to Amazon.  At least I do not think I will have to.  Good luck!"
"Downloading this product on a window 10 OS has not been fun! Also be aware that when purchased through Amazon you will be required to download ""Chrome Assist"" which allows Google (Or whomever) to track your physical location and who knows what else. More and more Amazon is requiring you to allow them access to your private info when you simply are BUYING (not anything else) a product."
"I have been very pleased with this product.  Installed easily, does not slow down the computer, catches what it needs to.  Price was exceptional."
Works fine! Now if it only would sync to my Android phone...
"In my local area (San Francisco Peninsula) the correspondence between the Topo U.S. 2008 maps and physical reality are off by from 200 to 500 feet!  When I play my tracks against Google Earth (a nice Mapsource feature, BTW) they are bang on, but way off on the Mapsource depiction.  I'm very reluctant to trust my life to this inaccurate mapping product, even more so in sparsely populated and back country areas where the location of streams and cliffs would be important to know accurately.
  I'm using the new eTrex Vista HCx unit which I like very much.
  Compiling map sets to upload to the GPS can take hours if a lot of segments are involved, and there are limitations to the number of map segment and file sizes the unit will accept.  So I bought three 1GB micro SD cards and can fit the entire US (lower 48 states) mapset in three chunks (West, Midwest and East), each with less than 2000 map segments and file size less than 1GB."
i got this open box and it didn't work. It would go through all the signs as if it was downloading but at the end it said it couldn't be done. Big disappointment
"In the past I have always used this software to do my taxes.  This year I decided to purchase it from Amazon and take advantage of the Bonus offer.  I Rec'd my refund over a month ago, placed two call's when the Amazon gift card via e-mail did not show up,  and I have yet to see my Amazon card.  Rec'd an e-mail telling me to look for my e-mail from Amazon in the next 24-48 hours - so they have the correct e-mail address and did not end up in my spam folder."
"People love to hate Windows 8, but I've had no problems with it. The UI has a lot of style."
"There are a lot of new features in Windows Vista Ultimate that I like, and after I purchased a new convertible notebook with it installed and solved some early glitches (incompatible software) it ran pretty well. But after only a few months it started crashing almost daily, and now it crashes several times per day. Sometimes it's a blue sreen, sometimes it freezes up, sometimes it just randomly reboots. The product was relased prematurely; it is not robust, nor as stable as Windows XP and Windows 2000. I am considering doing a clean install of Windows XP, which will be a hassle and will force me to give up some of the nice features of Vista like the Photo Gallery. But I would rather have a stable system."
Had a virus and this program did the trick!
Needs to be more beginner friendly
Excellent product
Only bought this because trial one came with computer. Have had nothing but problems since first update and on more than one computer. Will never buy this again. Fixed it for a while by starting it manually after windows starts but locked up again after update. Almost killed my computer more than once. No such problems after removing it.
"First of all let me say that the negative reviews out here are more than baffling to me except that it almost almost has to be people that either didn't follow the directions to the ""T"" or don't have as much to lose as I do with changing computers.  Another possible option is people that are not at all technical may have some struggles with it.  As a PC Tech my main computer systems are highly customized - countless applications, tools, etc and an unreal number of files, documents, database files, etc, etc.

Changing computers or reformatting my drive to reload the OS/Apps is a major nightmare that t literally weeks for me to complete.  I have to dig deep into my records to find licensure information, keys, etc and the cost to me in downtime and stress is so bad that it's something I will avoid sometimes for months longer than I should.  I'll endure a slow and unstable system for months before I break down and go through all that.

Introducing Laplink's PC Mover.  GONE are all the headaches aforementioned.  I moved from a 32-bit XP Pro system that is around 6 years old (an old Dell laptop) to a brand-spankin new Asus laptop running 64-bit Windows 7.  I had plenty of trepidation, believe me - to the point that I let the box sit on my shelf for over a year.  When I first purchased it I was just going to reload XP on the same system, then I bought the new laptop and it was time to make a decision. I had talked to a co-worker that'd had perfect success with the product so...I jumped in with both feet.

Let me just say that the 5-stars tells the story.  It went FLAWLESSLY.  Sure there were some apps on the old system that weren't compatible with the 64-bit OS; especially when combined with Win 7...but instead of crashing with an ugly blue-screen-of-death I was allowed to simply uncheck an app that was incompatible.  Everything from my registered, legal copy of MS Office 2007, with all docs, PST files, etc to the less popular programs I run on a daily basis...nearly all transferred with registry entries, licenses, etc - all in place flawlessly.

I highly recommend that anyone that is not quite technical get someone to help you that is - perhaps hire someone to assist.  You can most definitely do something wrong and cause a total failure on the new system.  There were several steps that I knew to complete just because I've been working in the IT/IS industry now for some 20+ years.

Bottom line - I most definitely H I G H L Y recommend this product!"
"I have not been able to install the now required Amazon Music Application properly or download my purchase of an MP3 Album to my ITunes.  When it downloaded on one computer, it doubled all my music taking up all computer disk space.  On the other computer, the application would not install and I cannot download the item purchased."
Terrible product. Used to be good just got the 2016 version because they don't support automatic downloads after a few years which I think is bullcrap and that doesn't work right. After downloading the transactions it missed several couple hundred dollar ones and I almost bounced my mortgage check.
"This software does not do what it claims to do. Most of the useful functions are in the Pro version only, which costs 5 times as much. After struggling for 4 hours to draw a 2D profile, when I went to extrude it, guess what? It's only available in the Pro version! Deluxe can only extrude primitive forms - circles, rectangles, arcs - but not complex curves. Useless. I am unable to make a 3D solid from my 2D sketch.

The program could not do a decent offset on a Bezier or Spline curve. Several times I drew something and it would not show up on the screen, but then I'd save the file and re-open it and presto! there it is. Want to send directly to 3D print (which literature implies is possible)? Pro version! Want to extrude with a draft angle? Pro version. Want to extrude multiple shapes? Pro version. Slice your model? Pro version. Chamfer or fillet edges on a solid? Pro. Need I go on?

I was VERY disappointed in this software. I know $99 is cheap for 3D design software compared with other programs out there (AutoCAD, Rhino, Solid Works, Geomagic) but from the writeup and reviews, I thought this software would at least function at a rudimentary level. It is a poor 2D drafting program and a completely useless 3D program.

If you are interested in 2D only, Dassault has a FREE 2D CAD program that works great. It's call DraftSight and it's really excellent. Unfortunately, I have not found an affordable 3D CAD program of comparable quality."
"We love 2 of the 3 CDs.  The Phonics one is a bit dark (sorcers with mean faces, dragons, crystal balls, and pentagrams).  Mickey Kindergarten and Pooh Kindergarten were really top notch.  The Pooh Bear one is our favorite."
"Yes, and because I loved the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook 16th edition, and because it is too heavy to haul around to look at between work and home, I bought a Kindle version so can scope it at work on computer too.  :)"
"I am an old engineer used to deal with Microsoft Office software for decades. I also dealt with cheap house building software for about 10 years. From this perspective Ive got mixed feelings after using Home Designer Suite for a couple of weeks. There is a lot of good and also bad from my point of view. To other eyes I understand that the balance of good and bad may vary to extremes depending on individual needs and expectations. This may explain the variety of scores this product got along many reviews.
-
Looking from the angle of getting a complete solution, ranging from drawing foundations until furniture and gardening, the overall impression is that those who developed and are maintaining the software have a profound sense of professionalism and respect for their customers. You will not have to get through a call center to get individual attention! On the other hand, you may also feel that the roots of the development of this solid software are not all in this century, as it was not developed to be adherent to mass market requirements of today where easiness of use is king. So you may at first glance conclude, in average, that this software is more appropriate for technicians and not for eventual users willing to rapidly draw the home of their dreams.
-
The basic conception of this software is solid but also rigid. I am not saying that this is true for the very basic tasks, where things have been developed to work fine and surprisingly smooth. The automatic roof building is a nice example of it as well as wearing rooms with furniture while working on 2D and 3D screens at the same time. But when you start diving 2"" under the surface of easy basics, youll stumble on a huge variety of problems. Most of them have a workaround. And they are well documented through one of the most robust and comprehensive support systems (FAQ + forum + videos + webinars + documentation + etc.) I have ever seen for any kind of software. Best in class in this sense, I would bed. But one might see all this as a way to compensate lack of easiness of use.
-
As you work with the program youll notice that each problem you face is a problem for itself, there is no rule of thumb to solve it, you must find your way throughout the huge amount of available support/content and it is not always easy to find what you want. This does not only turns the learning curve difficult, but later on, if you do not regularly use the software, you may easily forget what youve learned. Sometimes it looks to me that this program is more an adaptation of a rigid old fashioned CAD program added with innumerous adaptations to smooth a little bit its usage in certain areas.
-
After using the software for some time and starting to dive into details, youll clearly notice that robustness and exactitude comes from rigid parametrization. So within the freedom given by the parameters, you can make your projects in a very accurate way. But the downside is that you can only change the parameters that were previously defined. And unfortunately not everything is well parametrized. And there are also some parameters that you cant even change. If you do not find a solution for a problem in the predefined set of parameters, you most likely have to spend hours to find a way to circumvent it by applying special tips and tricks which are in no way intuitive or obvious. However, the number of such special solutions is impressive and well documented as emphasized before, but not easily accessible. There is no clear guidance through this jungle, although you will always get an angel at the company to give you a lift in the most critical cases. Here and there you also will be surprised to unveil intuitive well-done problem solutions that were not (clearly) documented. But do not expect too much in this direction.
-
Despite existence of innumerous ways to circumvent a problem, for some of them there is no solution at all, depending on the version of the program you have acquired. In fact the amount of software pieces which make software blocks work together in a smoother way are sold in form of features in the different versions of the program. Apparently, to the extent I could understand from Chief Architects advertisement, in the Professional version of Home Designer, youll find most of the problems solved in form of easy-to-use features, without needing to make lengthy researches and learnings to get it only partially solved through painful ways. But having to spend almost 500 box for it seems to be out of the real world. If we would talk about $200.- for the Professional version, it would make sense. But for $200.- youll get only the Architectural version which is only slightly better than the Suite version (as far as I could understand from advertising).
-
Below find a few examples of significant troubles Ive faced, regarding the Suite version ($99.-):
1) Setting the huge amount of defaults are not concentrated in one location, leading to a lot of confusion and waste of time;
2) Some defaults as particular wall definitions (like external wall color) you cannot predefine, leading to further lengthy and painful wall by wall setting;
3) No real freedom to design roofs as you are bound to a strait jacket of predefined roof patterns that are difficult to get adjusted to individual needs;
4) Roof always running over ceiling edges. No way to make roof fixed over low walls built above ceiling. And no way to have ceiling structure running out of the wall boundaries;
5) You cant set wall height individually, as this can only be done on a room by room basis;
6) Stair designer quite limited. If for instance you try to make a U turn stair without intermediate landing (i.e., angled steps in the U turn required) you will likely have to ask for individual support;
7) After workarounds, program behavior turns sometimes uncertain and erratic, eventually requiring painful rework;
-
To close this short review I would like to say that Ive spent hours and hours to learn just a little bit. Home Design Suite is a world for itself and just an expert will be able to take full advantage of it. Fortunately I am retired and spending all this time has not been a reason for giving up (for others it might be). On the other hand I must underline that I am very happy with the exactitude of the outcome of the plans Ive done. So Ive decided to stick to the product, even knowing its limitations and that the learning curve has not really finished. Due to the lack of deep and reliable reviews of this kind of software it scares me to jump to another competing $99.- product. I did not find a single clear lead that would give me confidence to give another specific product a try. At this moment I guess that any try could lead me to significant efforts that could not payout.
-
Balancing all these considerations against all the nice upsides the product has to offer (and they do are plenty, besides the overwhelming technical support), I must say that I am rather happy than dissatisfied. Life taught me that you cannot get the ideal by $99.-.
Perhaps some of the criticism I made above is not valid, essentially because I could not manage to turn into an expert. And my excuses in advance to those who developed the product is the low level of easiness for a newcomer to make quick progresses.
-
Finally I would like to underline that the three stars I have granted to this product are an absolute score looking from my personal experience and point of view, looking from Brazil where I live and also considering  the price. It couldn't be a relative score as I was not able to compare it to other competing products.

The key was invalid
"I got this unit at a bargain price [~US $50] and I am happy with that. It works well as a digital picture frame with audio. For the price I paid I would say it is as good as other similar frames. I have not tried adding my own videos yet but I suspect it will play them alright since the recipe books clips are OK.

The miBook books are cute and the video clips play well - recipes are easy and the way they are presented is smart. They first show you the list of ingredients, and then step by step directions which show you what to do - there is a pause at the end of each segment so you can catch up with chopping veggies or turning on the stove or whatever... It works well for what it is.

I was hoping this would work as an eReader of sorts. It can display files in a variety of formats, but there is no bookmark function so if you are reading a long book for example, and you stop for the night on page 20, you would have to press forward 20 times to get back to the same spot... which is kind of a bad flaw if you have files of any length. Overall I am happy with it but it is sad they didn't add a book mark feature or this would be an excellent eReader on a budget."
"Some interesting puzzles and basically user friendly.

My grand kids and I play it alot."

"Seems to be working great, but then I don't look at porn, so I'm not so vulnerable."
"First problem I had was that there was very little info. on instalation and ""how to"".  After instalation, regestration is required, I never got past this spot, message indicated program was regestered in my name, contacted support several times and followed all their tips and and passwords,  still got errors when trying to use ""user name and Password"", never was able to get on line, eventualy following all their instructions I was not even able to go to the site napster.com at all."
"In my old age (83), I accidentally deleted my ten-year-old edition of quicken.  Quicken worked so satisfactorily for my purposes it had to be replaced.  However, initially, New Scheduled Transactions could not be set up.  Following the printed instructions just did not work. Before Christmas, I made a few unsuccessful attempts to contact quicken.  Then, after Christmas, Quicken alerted me that an update was available.  I downloaded it; it solved the set-up problem.

Now, there is another problem with New Scheduled Transactions.  It's principal use is to send monetary birthday and anniversary gifts to seven children, thirty grandchildren, and nineteen great grandchildren and their spouses. Downloading Bank transactions didn't help.  Just the check number, no payee name, is displayed.  On line, you can can click on the check number and the check is displayed.  However, that is too work intensive.  Not all such checks are for birthday and anniversary gifts.  I'll have to find another way.  So far, I've only got the month of January 2013 set up. If there is no other way, I guess doing one month at a time will have to do."
"My son (2 yrs) really enjoys spending time with this software.  He has used for about 2 months, and now knows 1-10 numbers and most of the letters.  He almost has the shapes down and LOVES, let me repeat, LOVES the musical element in the waterfall.  The scrap book is TOTALLY COOL. This is a DEFINATE great place to start kids on computers.  We have the Disney Pooh for preschoolers and he prefers JumpStart hands down."
"The hardware device,that was included, was simple to install with the directions given. It gave a great image on the computer screen. The software got the job done but I think that the ""editor"" leaves much to be desired. I tried to delete a short section of video(5 to 10 minutes)and was unsucessful. If the company comes out with a ""4.0"" version, I hope they will improve the editor."
I saw this movie when I was in Britain last summer. Emma's character wasn't as wild as the title may suggest but there were a lot unexpected twists in this movie that made it more than your regular romcom. I highly recommend this movie and I will definitely buy this.
After 30 day trial of product subsequent scan of machine with different anti malware products uncovered no viruses of malware within that period. Four stars was given due to the condensed observation with the option for a future update after intensified scrutiny.
"Very easy to use. I have been using Turbo Tax for the last 10 years and it seems to get better every year. The only disappointing part is it says Federal and State, but I had to pay $29.99 to download the state taxes. I thought I had gotten a great deal but with having to buy the state tax it wasn't the deal I had thought it was."
"Several caveats to be aware of before purchasing:
- This product is no longer supported by anyone! Very typical of entertainment grade software.
- This product was designed to work under Windows 9x and Windows NT (!). It will install under Windows 2000 and presumably Windows XP.
- The format of the content is proprietary and unique to this product. You MUST use the supplied viewer software.
- The content seems to be stored in a reasonably high resolution. The viewer lets you zoom in, select, copy and print.
- Reportedly there is now a DVD version that provides the content in PDF format. For further details see For further details see [...]"
An effective product for creating and e-filing your federal and state tax returns.  This is the third year in a row that I have purchased this product.  It helps to be able to compare entries on your current return to entries from the previous year's return.
Tons of tutorials that are excellent. Would highly recommend to others. I couldn't beat the price of the product either.
"It's a terrible app. But the complaints about the product hanging are actually seeing an interface issue. When you upload a large file, the desktop app gives you no indication of progress. No progress bar. No nothing. When the file finally uploads completely, you get a message. It seems designed to get users to cancel big uploads."
If you have used photoshop (adobe) this program is very difficult to figure out.  Not very user friendly.
will not install want a refund
"I have recently upgrade to ACT 2008 and am impressed that it is even faster than ACT 2007. As a user of all versions going back to ACT 2000, this is by far the best. I love the new Dashboard feature. It helps me to be able to create a different dashboard for the various tasks/processes I use on a daily basis. I love the ease of creating and using queries. In our firm we send email blasts and postcard blasts to hundreds of clients at a time - and we are able to easilyb target our messages to different audiences. I recently upgraded to Office 2007 - and am glad that ACT integrates nicely. As a business owner, my entire company runs on ACT and Quickbooks. Both products are necessary to my business and provide the reports I need in order to measure and manage my staff. Probably the coolest thing is that my new hires are able to get up and running after a 2 hour introduction!"
I never used this software and do not have experience using this type of software.  It was easy to use and understand.  I did not like it as much as windows media player but it probably does way more.
"Don't waste your time learning these Adobe software products in school unless you know that you will be working with a company willing to pay exorbitant fees to run their DRM-laden, bloated junk. If there is a chance you'll be on your own or in small teams, get a Mac with Affinity software (Photoshop and Illustrator replacements, with an InDesign killer on its way), Readdle's PDF Expert, and Apple's video and audio options if you need them. Enough is enough with these subscription models."
"Great uninstaller programme, It found a lot of junk files, Invalid registries and with the cool traffic light like result and a backup option. I did not know my system had so many wasted files."
Avast is by far the most effective Antivirus available. I have never had a virus problem with Avast but just purchased a new computer with McAfee on it and had a virus problem within two weeks of purchase.  I would highly recommend this program.
the excellent practice test
Very powerful for home design and remodeling planning.
"Good product, but need to get some training. I do wish invoices were easier to start without previous menus"
"A great product for computer protection, we've used it for many years."
New to using the program & it's pretty Helpful so far.
"It is easy to upload and download, but this service does not allow you to schedule regular backups.  All transfers to the cloud drive are manual."
"Great Product
Microsoft office no longer offers a condensed version of Word, Excel.
We were using Microsoft 2003 and Word Starter - We do not need the many functions that Microsoft Office provides.
With LibreOffice, we do not need to continue an annual subscription.
Transfer from 2003 and Word Starter without any problems.
I only needed to set up the Print pages, i.e. print area and margins."
"Exactly as advertised, thank you!"
This is a great game with great graphics. It features Jurassic park (1) mission witch is to turn back on the power to Isla Nublar(the island witch Jurassic Park is on.) I would realy think about buying this game because it is great!!!!
excellent
"For the price I thought I'd get more than what amounts to a basic spread-sheet program that sync's with Quicken.

Yes, when I'm spending cash, or using a CC at the store, it's great that I can enter it into the PPC and it will import it into my Quicken.  But it's not stand-alone.  It won't really track your portfolios.  And it does not display any charts or graphs.

For $10 it's worth it, for $30 I would have rather saved the money and just entered in my reciepts when I get home.

I would suggest looking at alternatives like MS Money and SPB Finance."
"I do not believe I am a computer wizard but I have downloaded quite a few programs and it always has gone smoothly, this product was problems from the start.  It would download but would not leave any type of icon in order to open it.  When you went to the download directly did not open.

I ended up having to pay for  help in the download.

I can say only one thing, if you don't have a card, memory chip or disc don't buy this product.."
"simply the best, great company, i will recommend"
Great product
Office Mac is the best. I needed Word to write my papers for school and it really helped me to go through the semester.
We have been using Norton for years. Works well with no problems. Recommend!
"I used for many years Paint Shop Pro and it worked beautifully.
I updated last year to Pro X7 and I am so disappointed.
I just can't take it anymore, so I will uninstall it as soon as I finish writing this review.
The main issues:
- It takes forever to start, about 1 minute to load the settings.
- It keeps creating and adding the folders in the My Documents folder. For a few reasons that have nothing to do with the program, I need the settings saved to another folder. I go to preferences, I point to my custom folder and next time, I have again all the folders in My Documents.
I had no choice but to leave it there as there is no way I can waste 1/2 hr each time to change the directory to my folder each time.
- The last issue that 'broke the back of the camel' was the fact that crashes all the time when I scan from a network scanner.
I can only scan one page normally. When I scan the next one, it seems to scan it ok, but at the end the program encounters an error and closes.
I can start again the program, but it keeps crashing no mater how many times I try to scan. Only restarting the computer would allow me to scan again one single page!
What a disaster.
Just to prove how little common sense people that wrote this program have: The ""Save As..."" icon shows an arrow pointing away from the 'floppy disc' icon, which I have not seen anywhere else before.
I am looking for something else, and I feel bad that I wasted the money and so much time with this version.
I may just go straight to the free GIMP and see how that works. I don't need a lot of things, just basic scanning editing. I can do without the bloated special effects and 'tubes'."
Easy install and reasonable price.
great product
Is goood 
"Should you upgrade? Well, kind of, I tend always upgrade to the latest from Symantec. For this version I only recommend that you upgrade to ""Norton Anti-virus 2005"", the programs from Symantec such as System Works and Utilities are just the same, no major differences except for a more sleeker interface and the obvious bloat of it. Doesn't even include features your getting for free in Windows like a FireWall, which comes free with SP2 for Windows XP. The introduction of technology such as Activation was not smooth, and caused a lot of headaches which only makes the product less embracing than it use to be.

Symantec needs focus on areas such as Speed, Seamless Integration with Windows, obviously it has lost it. My next purchase from Symantec won't be in the retail line, but from Enterprise space. The Corporate Edition of Norton Antivirus, it offers all the tools I want for protecting my PC, yes it cost a lot and its targetted towards the Large Networks, but it is so subtle and easy to use and it does not bog down your PC.

So, should you upgrade?

If recently purchased System Works 2004 or Norton 2004 or any of the Symantec line of products at least wait until your one year subscription is up. Because that's what you buy a utility program for, to keep updated against the latest attacks."
"This is a product that Garmin should be ashamed of.  The trail data is at least ten to fifteen years old.  I purchased it to use for the Appalachian Trail monitoring that I perform as a volunteer for the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.  The maps do not show trail relocations that are in some instances fifteen years old.  The official USGS Topo maps show these relocations, but why not this set?"
"I purchased this as part of the Today's Deal that included the 2014 HD7 Fire. I loaded it up and test drove it through Level One Lesson One and am hooked. First, let me say I am TERRIBLE at any language other than American Standard English. I took Spanish for two years in Junior High (that's middle school for you Millenials), French for two years in High School (I scored lower than 50 per cent on my SAT), spent an exchange year abroad in Sweden, and took one year of Spanish in college (I walked out of the Final). I mean I am really bad at languages. So, now that I am retired, I thought I should try this again. So happy that I did. The power pack adds two pocket guides (for language in general and travel specifically) and the best dictionary I've seen for translation-it contains many idioms that come in handy immediately. So now I'm watching my Italian detective shows and look forward to turning off the subtitles. I also make the Italian great-granny who lives two doors away giggle with glee! Who could ask for more?"
"Just spent 4 hours attempting to transition, from a workable but flawed program with 2011.
The upgrade would not allow me to update any of my Accounts any further than April 30th.
I followed every instruction on the support and used CHAT, nothing. I was able to get my money back."
Great app
Works on Windows 10 and reads old WP files. Saves in many formats. In addition it is an excellent word processor.
I have used streets and trips for years.  I am a Cell Tech and Long Haul Tech and use this software to find Cell sites and Fiber sites. And with out this I could not do my job for sure.  The download was easy and very productive.
"Only if you ABSOLUTELY require MS 'cause you can't do without say, Outlook, or must collaborate in a project with others using MS Office then it's on you. Otherwise plenty of cheap and free office suites that are great at documents, spreadsheets and can create just as boring a presentation as PowerPoint.

It's from Microsoft, so, if you can download it at all after jumping through a zillion hoops, it will take an hour and a half to install on a brand new i5 laptop. Then you risk the typical MS phone home spyware. Then, if and when it finally runs, Word is just as awkward, funky, and crappy as it ever was. Let's face it, for your typical one or two page letter, any of the free word processors will do. For longer stuff, check on Amazon for inexpensive, capable and fairly easy to use desktop publishing software.

Just nope. Installed it for family member that needed it for work but never if there's a choice. Gave it one star because there's no option for none (or even negative stars)."
My niece loved watching it!
"So I believe this is the best illustration product available right now to use with my Surface Pro 3.  I tried a bunch of different programs and judged them using these criteria:

Pen handling / Pen lag on Surface
Pressure sensitivity
Brushes / mixed media / customization
Layers / Selection
User Interface suitability for Tablet PC

So here's a rough comparison with some other tools: (CSPP = this product, Clip Studio Paint Pro)
Photoshop CS6.  This is a desktop app that isn't suited for the tablet.  The interface text is too small.  The Pencil tool is terrible, while CSPP's pencil is pretty good and lets you adjust a host of different settings including texture!  CS6 is made for desktop and Cintiq, and I find changing colors to be awkward.  CSPP lets you press the button on the pen and it turns into the eye dropper tool!  Perfect.  CSPP is made for tablet, so standard zoom, rotate, and move gestures with your hand work just fine.  Plus, if you can pick Tablet PC in the settings which does palm rejection correctly so you don't accidentally paint with your hand resting on the screen.  CSPP has great illustration features, like the way strokes respond to pressure.  You can adjust sensitivity to stroke width, opacity, flow, etc, and resetting defaults is a breeze.  All the default media options are pretty good right out of the box.  PHOTOSHOP CC's SUBSCRIPTION MODEL IS DEAL-BREAKER FOR ME.  I hate subscription models for software with a passion, and CC is just an insult--you can buy CSPP for the price of one month of Photoshop CC!

Mischief.  I like the way Mischief's pens are adjustable and the way the pen handles, but the infinite zoom, pan, and vector based framework make it unsuitable for production artwork.  Mischief is good for sketching ideas, but CSPP let's you make finished pieces you can submit as part of your portfolio, actual manga panels, or even textures for games.

ArtRage Touch: They claim it isn't lag, but the program's pen handling isn't great and the gap created by their stroke anticipation was something I just couldn't get used to.  ArtRage offers great mixed media types including an amazing oil paint, but CSPP is just as good.  Plus I prefer the way colors mix right on the canvas with CSPP instead of ArtRage's mixing system.  In CSPP, the color you pick mixes with the paint on the canvas as if it is wet, which is similar in ArtRage except ArtRage always starts with the color ""overlaying"" the existing paint before sort of petering out.

Sketchable: Poor pen handling, the user inteface is a little awkward, and the simulation of mixed media is not nearly as good as CSPP.  CSPP's pencil, watercolor, and oil paints are all quite good.

Autodesk Sketchbook: Something about the interface and the way you change brush size and pick colors is just awkward.  I find it slows down the process of illustration.  While I admit the pen handling and pressure sensitivity is quite good on Sketchbook, I find I prefer the way CSPP handles the various types of media, especially oil paint (I don't remember Sketchbook providing oil paint mixing on the canvas as a feature.)  THE SUBSCRIPTION MODEL FOR PRO, ALTHOUGH ONLY $24.99 / year, IS STILL ANNOYING.

Corel Painter also seems to be made for desktop, and there were issues with the pen handling and interface.  Not to mention it's nearly $500!

I've already written too much.  I consider myself an amateur illustrator but I've got lots of experience with physical media like pencil, charcoal, conte, watercolor, and oil paints.  Obviously a Surface pen isn't going to provide the same brush experience as a real fan brush, but I'm amazed at how faithful the experience is given the limitations of the hardware.  You can go wrong with this purchase at $25.

And the people that gave the product one star reviews don't seem to know how to use a computer.  I had ZERO issues downloading the software, installing it, and entering the product key to activate it on my Surface Pro 3 running Windows 10."
"I'm returning this. Looks fishy to me. Says right on the card 'not labeled for individual resale.' Instructions say to 'Click or touch the Office tile on the start screen.' I use a Mac, thus no start screen. Also says it's for a Dell Tablet. Product description says PC or Mac Key Card. Strange."
"I have found that in order to be a successful business you have to do quality work, stick to schedules(appointments or work times), invoicing along with any paperwork or documentation, and follow-up(either a letter or phone call). Like anything, you get what you pay for when it comes to equipment, employees, and software products. QuickBooks for me has become a necessity in all steps of my business. I use it for sales(estimates and bids), payroll, taxes, paying bills, invoicing, and many others. This is one of three main back bones to my business. I could not have been as well prepared or successful. It makes my company run like a well oiled machine. It gives my company a very good image from an organizational standpoint. When your organized it gives you a huge degree of confidence. Take a lesson well earned, incorporate QuickBooks into your life; it will save you time, money, and peace of mind. Good Luck!"
"After buying the 2003 upgrade, we have had real problems.  Although earler versions ran well and the computer fully meets system requirements, the 2003 version is extremely slow.  When you put the cursor over the menu bar, it takes two seconds before it is recognized.  Click on the item and it takes up to 5 seconds for the menu to appear.  Call Intuit and they want your credit card to talk to a ""software engineer.""  I understand how they can charge for company specific accounting questions, but charge for software problems?  My advice, save your money and don't upgrade.  As a long time Intuit/Quicken customer I am very disheartened with the company and their products."
Very difficult to install on my iMac. Darn near impossible to use. No value to me.
"Just finished returning the two Home & Business licenses I purchased. Thank goodness for Amazon's easy return policy. I figured I'd upgrade to this new Office Mac 2016 because,well they have not released a version for the Mac in 5 years. What could go wrong, I reasoned. They've had 5 years to work on this new version, It must be significantly better, right? WRONG. Its not better, in fact, its way worse. Why? THEY GOT RID OF THE RIBBON CUSTOMIZATION! What in the world were they thinking? And if thats not bad enough, there are very few options provided on the ribbon now. So they took away a bunch of functionality and provided you with NO WAY to put it back. Here's an example of why this is so bad: In outlook, I hate the preview pane so I turn it off. No problem, you can do that in the new version too. But once the preview pane is gone there is now no way to go to next/previous message. That's right, those little up/down arrows in the upper right corner of the 2011 version - gone now with now way to put them back. So now I have to close the current message and click on the next. Not efficient at all, not to mention very annoying.
Thankfully, the uninstall of Office 2016 is easy, and it did not wipe out my Office 2011, so I'm back in business with the older version. But shame on you Microsoft, you managed to screw up the only MS product I care about ( or used to care about)."
"Good price, does the job of keeping viruses and malware out, but too many scare ads from 3rd party partners."
"Although they advertise 1 year of support and upgrades, there is an additional charge through sage that will will double your cost."
Epic as always. Not the easiest to understand for someone with no formal education on the subject of photography. There are great features for anyone who wants to fix their photos of errors or other such things for overall improvement. I would recommend this for amateurs as a great way to learn more about photo manipulation and editing. If you are already fairly educated on these sorts of programs then I would imagine it's easy to use.
I is a good value program for generating simulated paintings from photos automatically. i have not learned how to make manual edits of photos.
"Product was very poor, it didn't show anything where we wanted to go. This is strange since it was just 8 miles from the airport in San Jose and the place we were going has been there for 32 years. This is particularly annoying since I was able to rent a Garmin from the rental car company which showed everything. This map is sadly out of date and it is obvious almost totally useless"
I downloaded the trial version - and I can't be more thankful I did. On their website they state that the trial is exactly like the regular version.  My computer started acting funny...I would click something and multiple items would highlight.  In email this happened and even when I clicked and had 3 items highlighted and managed to open one - email wouldn't delete. I couldn't delete this fast enough.
"A brand new Sony running Windows 7, and I still have endless bugs with this program. Very frustrating to use. The latest is I can't delete the master user, their instructions are either wrong or out of date.

I've been using DietPower for months and I've had it. The database is really limited and they haven't updated it for years and years. Nice little cash cow you got here, but guys, it's time to do a better job for the consumer."
"Quicken is intuitive and easy to use. I prefer it over Quickbooks for the type of business I do. I especially love being able to see all of my companies at once, compared to tediously opening and closing each individual company in QB.

However, it has massive PROBLEMS SYNCING accounts. At least one of my accounts needs to be reset almost every day because Quicken thinks the account was closed. One of my credit cards always shows double transactions. I generally just ignore it and look at the ""Balance Online"" on the bottom of the page.

While typing this, I had to re-enroll in Online Banking, re-add all 14 of my accounts, rename them all with a ""1"" at the end of the name, delete the originals, then delete the ""1"" from each correct account name. Now I have to redo two months of recording transactions. I don't know if that is a Quicken problem or if BofA forced it, but this is very frustrating. If it happens again, I will demand my money back and return to QB."
just needed to update my wife's version works as advertised.

When I needed a full operating system this system was cost effective and functioned well for my needs. It can also repair a system when you have a malfunction with another Windows Vista Operation System. Repaiware is built into the OPS and can unfreeze and repair a fault.

"I have been using Quicken Basic 2000 for many years and thought it was about time to upgrade so I purchased Quicken Basic 2007.  I am seriously thinking about removing this software and going back to Quicken 2000.  I only use Quicken for basic functions such as tracking each of our accounts, we don't write checks through quicken.  Quicken 2007 doesn't provide any improvements to these basic functions and in some cases makes it harder to perform these basic functions.  The Quicken homepage is entirely worthless to me, cannot be edited, deleted or hidden so it is just in the way.

I thought there would be some improvement in the reports and more flexibility in formats and options, but so far it appears the reports and formats are essential the same as Quicken 2000.  Unless I have missed something this upgrade was pretty much worthless and actually went backwards in ease of use.  I would NOT recommend this upgrade if you are looking for an improvement in Quicken Basic"
Had to send back I thought that it work with Mac but it does not
"I've been using ACT since it ran on a DOS machine, but the latest versions are beyond horrible -- they don't run on 64-bit machines. I can't find a single written document from them that makes that statement but tech support admits the problem -- once you've installed it but can't get it running. I had ACT 2007, then upgraded to 2008 only to discover it was even worse. I've uninstalled both of them but my computer is now so unstable I'm going to have to reformat the hard drive to get rid of the glitches. The only good thing about ACT 2008 is that they cheerfully refunded my money. Please, please, please don't install this program unless you're all backed up and want to spend a day or two reformatting your hard drive and reinstalling your other programs! And, if you're like me and half your life is in your ACT database, don't upgrade from version 6. It's the only one that even half-way pretends to be exportable to another program. Sage should be ashamed of themselves for what they've done to a program I've loved and recommended for running up on 20 years!"
"I am a student of Chemistry AP course in high school. I took regular chemistry course during summer two years ago. Honestly, I forgot everything I learned. My memory's not so good. I was very worried when my teacher said we have a first big test coming up. Then, several of my friends recommended me ChemTutor Excalibur. They said it's great, so I tried it, and it was amazing! It explained many confusing stuffs in a very easy way, and ""learn"" and ""explain"" sections helped me more than my text book. Everything is organized very well. It was a great opportunity to experience many types of probolems. Also, great solution and explanation for every problem! I felt like I became a master of Chemistry! Indeed, I got 107 and 102 out of 100 in my two big tests that I took this year. I was very happy about that.

It is also very interesting to study with computer! It's not boring~!

I strongly recommend all of you to get this great helper!!!

ps: since it has very concise explanation, it's also very helpful for the international students!"
Excellent Product. Been Utilizing for Nearly Ten Years. Will Buy Again.

"I have tried almost every slide show program on the market but this is by far the best. I have constructed large and complex shows using this software, fighting all the way against the deficiencies that I have perceived. The major problem in my opinion is the inability to use music and sound in a format other tham WAV files. Raised to a reasonable quality level these files become enormous. It would make a lot of sense if other formats could be used, such as MP3.  Despite this handicap I heartily endorse the program and hope that the Kai people include different sound formats in any subsequent release."
"Totally useless product.  I bought this to edit some books that had scanned as PDF files.  The first and the only book I tried on was 600 pages.  It took about 25 minutes to save the document with a different name, saving it with the same name after some changes took 15 minutes.  I was just sitting and watching it 1% saved, 2%, %3...
Use ABBYY PDF Transformer Plus instead.  It is much faster, a lot more useful, and about the same price."
The software was fine.  It was needed because I could no long connect with my banking institutions.  I was using a 2011 version.
"After seeing the bad reviews, I almost didn't purchase PDF Producer. However, I called Data Becker (during normal business hours at 617-614-0600) and, with very little trouble, got a live person on the phone who answered all of my questions and allayed my concerns.  Two good hints: It only works with Win 2000 or XP (as it says right on the specs); and, it's important to close ALL programs (including printer software) running in the backgroun before loading.
PDF Producer loaded flawlessly in a few minutes on my Windows XP system with MS Office 2003. It works just like any other printer driver, and I personally like the idea that it doesn't intimately integrate with other programs (such as putting an icon on the task bars) -- if something does go wrong with PDF Producer my other programs are still in business.
The product works excellently -- making PDF files of anything that can normally be printed. The PDF Producer settings needed a bit of tweaking to get the quality and file size I wanted, and this was easily done following the built-in help screens or the manual that came with the retail package.
PDF Producer doesn't have all the functionality of Adobe Acrobat, but at about 1/6 the price it is a very cost-effective solution for turning just about anything into a basic PDF."
I have used turboTax For the past 16 years and would not anything elsa
"It's a shame that one has to endure Microsoft products that have issues. I spent over three hours trying to upgrade from Windows 7 Ultimate to Windows 8 Pro (32 bit) only to get to 90% installation when a message pops up saying ""Failed Installation"". Twice I tried and twice Microsoft has succeeded in living up to its typical expectations. On the plus side at least after the failed installs it goes back to Window 7 like nothing has happened. In addition, I went to their website to find the ""Upgrade Assistant Tool"" to see if it showed any issues, it only showed a few programs that still have to be reloaded after installing Windows 8. This is strange because during the failed installs, using the purchased Windows DVD, this did not pop up as an issue. The only reason I purchased this version, is because it would work all programs after installed.
One would think that somewhere along this journey you could receive some support or at least a hint on why it will not install, but not so.  It gets more difficult to baby sit products that are not better supported and require one to spend hours and sometime days dealing with it.
Staying with Windows 7."
"We ordered this DVD through Amazon via Sail On. They sent us a used DVD (no packaging), which did not work. After stringing us along, we returned the DVD and were promised a replacement or refund. Needless to say, they have avoided our e-mails since. I would recommend NOT dealing with Sail On Software."
I have spent HOURS trying to get this to work. It worked fine for one day and then the little Mic button would not recognize my headset. The customer service is HORRIBLE - you email each other over several days and it just keeps going on and on with no resolution - THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING. PLEASE GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER. I bought this to save time but it have cost me more time and frustration than I ever could have believed.
"I may add to this review later, but for now, here is this one.

I Was an intuit customer for a decade now. For various reasons I felt it was time to go and so I tried one of the store-fronts a couple years ago; what a mistake that was. That was a bad experience and even worse than Turbo Tax.

Heard about TaxACT from Consumer Advocate Clark Howard, and so I switched last year (2015). Found it doesn't have all the same bells and whistles as Turbo Tax, but I found it had all the necessities I needed to complete my tax. I even went ahead an purchased a 2012 version (hence this order) to complete a neglected filing year. I liked the program and found no problems with it."
"I haven't had much opportunity to use this software to its fullest potential yet, but I tried a few sample problems with it and I was pretty impressed by its step-by-step action.  I bought the software because I am COMPLETELY befuddled by all things mathematical and I will have to pass at LEAST one more algebra-related course in order to get my degree.  I wanted to be prepared.  From what I can tell, as long as I have a working computer and this software program, I should be in pretty good shape.  Ask me after August of 2008 and I can tell you whether it paid off or not!"

Ease of use is very user freiendly.
"Every year I hope they will simplify the questions, and every year it gets longer.  The software will ask a yes or no question and then query 3-4 more questions, even if the first answer was negative.  VERY ANNOYING!  I am sure they want to get ""every possible deduction"", but I am pretty sure if I have foreign investments or own additional homes, just trust me and lets go on!  I hope that the results of the ""audit"" in the software are accurate, as by the time I get through, it has managed to ask questions that make no sense and help is non existent or dumber than the question as to what they are even talking about.  I miss Parsons.  Just let me fill out the forms and help if needed, thank you.  Please make it easier for the 99% of us that have a simple income from one state."
"I have trusted Trend Micro for years now, and would simply not choose any other security product.  It is easy to install and always there to protect."
"So far, I've noticed very little difference.
1. Somebody spent a lot of time on the vertical menu bar and other GUI changes which offer little benefit or make working in the program even more annoying.
2. The layout designer hasn't been updated since 2006!  And you still can't convert an invoice to an estimate, so if you want your estimate to look like your invoice, you have to redesign everything from scratch.
3. The company snapshot is a nice idea, but counts pending invoices as open even if they haven't been sent.  It also shows ""Active Estimates"" but there's no way to make an estimate ""inactive"", so what is the point of that category?
4. Just like in 2011, QB will only format addresses properly for checks OR 1099s, but not both.

All kinds of little annoyances like the above are what keep me from feeling like this software really fits my company.  I only use it because I haven't found any reasonable alternatives yet."

"I installed Qustodio on my IPAD, Macbook, and Dell PC. Everything was fine until the free trial expired. After that my DELL would no longer boot up (and still won't...I get an error related to Qustido and a grey screen), my Macbook could no longer access the internet (which was needed to download the uninstall file), and the password did not work on the IPAD app. Fortunately I was able to delete the app on my IPAD the old fashioned way  (Press & Hold). Looking like I am going to have to do a factory reinstall on my Dell with Windows 10."
I can't say enough about this product and getting a 5 user package for this price is outstanding. Norton has saved my bacon again and again
Good pre-retirement tool.
What was i thinking?  This product is ancient. I can't play it in my devices.  I'm sure it's good but if it was about 10 years earlier it would be fine.
"I am so glad for the review process because I recently purchased a new computer and wanted to continue to use the simple balance checkbook manually feature without having to go online for any of my banking information, and this was the correct product for my needs using Windows 8."
"Too bad it's so expensive. Works very well though, I begrudgingly admit that it was worth the price."
"I never considered myself an ""advanced"" user of Excel, so I was hopefull that StarOffice would be advanced enough to meet my modest spreadsheet functionality demands. I was mostly disappointed after spending several hours trying to set up buttons to accomplish my most frequent requirements. One after another, setting up button functions involved work-arounds, compromises on results, or spending too much time clicking buttons and menus. If I was interested in spending that much time and attention in formatting and editing spreadsheets I would have continued with my old 1-2-3 classic.  To be fair, it does have some well-thought out features, but in the end I decided that if my time (and attention) is worth anything I need to have a more functional spreadsheet.
  I don't feel ""ripped off"" however and think it is probably worth the price even if I only end up using the presentation (slideshow) program."
"Text recognition is very good on a simple, typewrited page but, hey, there are sharewares that do this for free. I tested Omnipage mainly on complex textbook pages with headers, 2 columns, figures with legends. I chose 240 dpi as a compromise between size and accuracy. The result:

1. When converting a 2-column page to PDF, the text flows ACROSS the columns instead of down then right. Useless for cut & paste. Also, word search is not sequential. Omnipage support never answered my questions on this issue (nor on any other).

2. Figures with small objects on a contrasting background (e.g. birds flying in the sky) are interpreted as text, with laughable result. In general, the recognition of image fields was bad.

5. Figure legends were systematically included with the text around them instead of being assigned to a separate text box.

4. This beast needs A LOT of CPU. I ran it on a 2.8GHz P4 and it was crawling through the pages.

5. Not an Omnipage issue, but as an aside: Omnipage offers to save the text as a MS Word file. Note that MS Word will not open a file larger than 32 Mb. I did not know this. Did you?

Final word: mediocre, too expensive. Try sharewares first."
"Avast has the usual pleas to upgrade, but has proven to be an excelent program"
"Download went flawless, worked without any problems. Excellent price with technical adviser available if needed at no cost to user."
"I love this product, after working with it just a few times, I find myself saying the phrases and really understanding them.  It helps sooo much!"
I use H&R Block every year.
Just bought a new laptop and I am happy I didn't have to pay for Microsoft. I am able to open all my docs that I transferred from old computer.
It has never failed me and I have the free version. Thanks Avast Free Antivirus!!!!!!!
"While attempting to make business cards this week, and not wanting to turn on my desktop, I decided to try downloading this software on my laptop with Vista.  I really didn't think it would install, since it was created before Vista; but was hoping Vista would come up with configurations to make it work.  Well, no configurations were needed!  It installed very easily and very fast, with no problems at all.  It's also not freezing up, like it often did on my desktop with XP.  If any of this changes, I'll edit this review.  But for right now, I'm thrilled I thought of installing it on my laptop, because I love Digital Image!"
I need this software very quickly for a new network setup.  They were very accommodating with my request and I had it in time for the installation.  Thank for the great experience.
great depend
"Every other year, Norton is great. Resource hog...if you have a slow computer, it will be even slower."
"This is a terrible product, and there is virtually no product support. I don't usually bother writing reviews, either good or bad ones, but this is ridiculous."
I am unable to use this.  Every time I put in my activation code nothing works.  Please refund my purchase.
The ability to write a business plan for most people would be impossible the program guides you through the entire process and it looks great. It takes you step by step through each part of a business plan from beginning to end and guides you on what to put in each segment. I highly recommend this product especially if you just started a small business and would like investors this is the first thing they want to see is a Business Plan.
"This purchase is the best investment since buying my computer. Can't  get anything done without it, just truly love this item."
"Didn't like it at all, too many menus, the sound alerts, etc"
"Small, completely portable, inexpensive, and, best of all, WORKS GREAT and BETTER than expected!  I'm using this in my RV to take advantage of the public WiFi.  So glad I bought this & now I can watch streaming videos and music on YouTube, CNN.com, & other websites whereas before I could not get a strong enough signal."
"I've been using Norton for several years and have not experienced any problems, plus this price was great"
"The Arabic Rosetta Stone is a wonderful language program that really does work.  It is fun and challenging.  The new edition of the Rosseta Stone is more interactive and more user friendly.  I would recommend this product to all students interested in learning standard Arabic.  The item arrived promptly and in pristine condition.
Cheers."
"We had high hopes that this would be as helpful and humorous as TurboTax, but it is so basic that it really misses the mark for our needs. We were hoping it would ask us questions that would lead to a few more nuances in writing a will, but if you have anything at all complicated (eg, two properties or a couple of pension sources), this software is not intelligent enough to suggest anything creative or thoughtful. Really disappointed."
"I recently installed XP on my Intel Mac using both Bootcamp and Parallels.  Bootcamp was a very straightforward procedure and I've had very little trouble with it.  Parallels on the other hand is a much more finicky program that seems to look for new reasons not to work (and more often than not, finds them).

I suppose that I will eventually get it running properly. But it is a shame that a program with so much potential is such a pain to get going."
It was an expensive unnecessary buy. The program works and all but I regret this buy because there is no feature that the computer doesn't already have it.
Nice easy to use software. I was looking around for quite some time for something not too expensive. Works great and easy to use after going through some tutorials.
"Check the Quicken Community before you purchase this version of Rental Property Manager.  The web site is littered with comments regarding the issues and data loss (visibility and/or corruption - Quicken isn't sure as yet).

This has to be the absolutely worst release of software that Intuit has ever foisted on the market.

Updated:  12/3/2015  Quicken has released an update to correct some of the issues that they and their customers discovered in the 2016 version.  Per Kathryn in support, there is another release expected in the next week or so.  I am updating the stars on this review as this patch appears to have corrected all of my issues.  Though this was a major Faux Pas with the release, they did expend a great deal of effort to provide a quick fix and they should be commended for doing so.

Quicken is the best personal financial management software on the market (IMHO).  Their incremental releases offer modest improvement(s) but in terms of longevity and managing your financials, there is no peer."
"I generally like the app itself.  However, it consumes way too much CPU while running.  I have no idea why it should consume any CPU but it constantly hovers around 20% of the CPU while playing music... playing music is NOT a CPU intensive task.  Please fix!!!"
"I bought it (direct from the InnovativeLanguage Store).  It didn't work on my 10.6.8 iMac.  More precisely, the files would not run, open, unarchive, or anything.
They did not reply to my numerous emails.
I will not waste my time with any of their products again."
"This is my first ever negative review on a product.

Downloaded the software and prepared a presentation after days of hard work.  Presentation went well.  Another group of audience requested the same presentation.  When I went back to open the presentation I was shocked.  The slides had all disappeared.  Controlled my panic and started to search on blogs for solutions.  Numerous reports of disappearing slides and as well as entire presentations.

NO SOLUTION.

On Amazon many have reported erratic computer behavior, Infection with viruses, loading the machine with stuff that would make your computer slow.  Now that I think about it I think my computer has all these issues.

I tried to analyze the positive reviews.  A lot of users have used it for basic .tasks such as letter writing, spread sheet function and so forth

I have to redo all my slides.  I guess it's either PowerPoint or Google Slides.  Will need to bring computer to a hardware guy to kill AOO and rid the machine of viruses and whatever else is ailing it"
Good.
"On Mac iOS, Roxio doesn't follow the upgrades of the OS.
On El Capitan no upgrade is available.
On Sierra neither...
For me,  this product, paid over CHF 100.- became unusable.
Avoid it"
Fantastic deal. Who needs Photoshop?
love it better then photoshop and more cheap then photoshop.
"The product did not work.  Because it had originally been purchased by another owner, I did not have the copy rights to install it, so it was a complete waste of money."
Does not work!!! Don't waste your money. Amazon should offer return or pull item!!
We've used Word Perfect since its very beginning and cannot fully explain what a blessing it has been in our life of writing and editing. Truly the greatest invention since sliced bread. Don't turn on your computer without it. What more can we say. It is word PERFET.
Great value - what else can I say- It works!

"This was to cover all my needs. In mid completion, I was pressured to buy Premier for an additional $32. I was angry."
"SnagIT 12:  1 star of 5.

I used SnagIt7 for a long time.  Anything SnagIt7 lacked in features it made up for with its responsive, fast, clear interface.  With SnagIt 12 we have the opposite - the user interface was designed by an artist, not anybody who knew a thing about usability.  It takes forever to make a screenshot (there seems to be some artificial pause built into it) plus you must press an extra button to tell it you want a 'photo' screenshot not a 'video' one.  The drawing tools are really really bad in SnagIt12.  First of all, they used monochrome large icons for thsee.  to move to more drawing tools and options requires unnecessary scrolling.  I still haven't foudn the single head bendy arrow.  Changing line thicknesses, etc all requires going into menus and submenus - what a pain in the backside!  And then, because everything is an ""object"" now, positioning one object on top of another to annotate the screenshot quickly exposes some ui bugs and annoyances.  I tried snagit12 for one week.  I'm now back to snagit7.

The good news about snagit12 is that it does video capture and you can annotate it.  and, it actually seems to work.

Camtasia Stuiod 8:  4 of 5 stars.  not bad but more terrible user interface decisions.  The good news is that it seems to be fairly stable and it provides an 'ok' timeline editor.  Nothing spectacular, but good enough to do some business type movies.  I have not looked at this deeper. I am somewhat put off by the user interface, again, designed by an artist I think instead of a UI designer.  I am a user of previous versions of camtasia and generally found them to be ok, though you have to work against their system somewhat.  The good news is that despite the interface issues, overall, as opposed to snagit, this one seems to be getting better overall."
"it takes some training, which is included.  Once you learn the program it works great."
I hate that you HAVE to subscribe to support just to reproduce. Awful ...I miss the original Peachtree
"Product works as advertised. If you like Windows 8, and don't mind an OS that's optimized for touch control, go for it. Even if you don't, still put consideration into W8; While it takes a bit of getting used to, it's fast and much simpler than it seems."
Works well.
"I had the old MS works 6.0 and it was giving me problems with my new windows 8 laptop. I purchased this item and it works great.
In fact, It seems to be even faster on startup etc."
"It performs the desired tasks suitably.  Processing time is quite slow in comparison to the pro 10 version; however, for the price SFAS9 is an excellent choice."
"Disappointing.  Very awkward to use. Only useful if the family you're working on has migrated across lots of places.  If your people went from Germany to Philadelphia and settled in Pa, it's virtually useless."
"I bought this for use in my media room, with my Mac Mini attached to my stereo and projection TV system.  I have the Mac Mini attached through HDMI to my Onkyo stereo system, running 5.1.  The audio does not work.  I get a lot of sound from the left rear speaker, nothing from the right rear, very little from the front.  I tried every switchable combination (from the pull-down menus).  I verified all the interconnect hardware was working using my downstairs Blu-Ray player, same cable, same Blu-Ray disc, same Onkyo settings.  I verified that HDMI was working on my Mac Mini using Netflix, Vimeo, etc.

I contacted Macgo tech support.  They responded but were unable to provide any solution.  I asked for my money back and they ignored me.

Bummer.  I had high hopes."
"As described, great price compared to others.  I admit that I am barely computer literate, so am still learning additional aspects.  Mainly I wanted the word processing which I used immediately.  Shipping was simple with the download!"
"I've had occasion to use Laplink PC Mover two separate times. Once for transferring files from my husband's old computer to his new one; and once for transferring files from my old computer to my new one.

The transfer of my husband's files was first and went a bit smoother than my files transfer. However, in both instances, any difficulties I experienced were caused by ""operator error"" where the ""operator"" was me!

Although the directions for transfer were quite clear, when I got to the ""select files"" section in some instances I was uncertain which files to transfer so I just let the software choose. (My husband does not have any MS Office software so his transfer was pretty much uneventful.)

On the other hand, when I transferred files it took four tries and each time I had to start over. Unfortunately, I plugged the USB cable into front of the computer USB ports. As a result, I accidentally kicked the cord on my new computer, which pulled it loose enough that I had to start over.

All that aside, I'm extremely pleased to have had PC Mover to transfer the files. For the most part, the instructions were easy enough to understand and to follow. When it asked if I wanted to transfer applications that I did not know what they were, I let the software go ahead and transfer it.

Also, because my old computer has lots and lots of documents, files, software, etc., the transfer took a long time.

The PC Mover software that I used also came with PC Sync, which enables me to sync my two computers in the event I want to use the two of them together. That is my plan, although at the present time my original computer is at the shop.

"I've used Turbo for a number of years and It's friendly.  I also used H & R for my Sub S 2013 and found it good.  If I can't find a good price for Turbo, I'd be temped to use H&R exclusively."
"I have had no success installing this on my home PC which is a little better than the stated minimum requirements. I have a 1.8GHz Pentium processor with 512MB of RAM, a 200GB hard drive with 100GB available. Still I couldn't install on my PC. It would just hang during the installation process.
I'm now waiting to get a better PC before I can really try this out, but I'm already disappointed!"
"Rollback Rx is much more reliable than Windows System Restore.  I have used System Restore frequently for years. System Restore works about 50% of the time for me, even after reading about its quirks and learning a lot of them the hard way.  Rollback Rx has had a lot of good reviews, rave reviews, even."
"I had a crash on my notebook and found that preloaded programs were lost. No backup disks were provided so I needed word program for my work. After spending over $200 to have computer repaired, I had little money to buy replacement programs, so I found just what I needed on Amazon for 1/4 the new price. Program was like new and I am back in business."
"I bought this for school- everyone uses Word. But after a year, things started to go missing- the language tool (I needed it for French class), the columns tool, I no longer have a thesaurus, spell check only edits certain words now. I have tried for months to get Microsoft to help me with the problem. After a run-around, I was told that I could not be helped. Why did I spend my money? Who knows. But buyer beware- should things go wrong, you're on your own."
"I had previously written a review on this item, but it seems to have disappeared. I'll do my best to recall my previous review.

In a nutshell, Corel's WordPerfect OfficeX7 is an attempt to create a (more or less) drop-in replacement for certain parts of Microsoft Office. In particular, you will find ""cloned"" versions of MS Word (a word processor), MS Excel (a spreadsheet program) and MS PowerPoint (a presentation program). Obviously, this is not meant to be a full-blown replacement, as it lacks its own versions of MS Outlook, Access and some proprietary extensions that you can only get from Microsoft.

The results are a bit mixed. For those of you who are casual users of Office, there is no steep re-learning curve to speak of. If you are a ""power user"" who has memorized many of the keyboard shortcuts, menu trees and other items that let you whiz through Microsoft's products like a pro, it can be much more difficult to get used to.

For the most part, this product lets you open most files created in Word, Excel and PowerPoint without any problems. You can then edit or modify them and save in a variety of different formats, including most traditional formats used by Microsoft (i.e. .doc, .xls). If you are creating a document from scratch, you should be able to save it in the same variety of formats, so that someone using MS Office can open it without knowing that it was created by WordPerfect. This seems to work about 98% of the time and when it doesn't, it is not always the fault of WordPerfect to be fair.

Compared to the ""real"" Office, Corel's product fares pretty well for the most part. It's biggest drawbacks seem to be lack of documentation, lack of support, some occasional software instability and the few instances where compatibility of documents does not always work exactly as it should. For the ""average"" user, these trade-offs are probably worth the considerable price difference. In corporate settings or other situations where you might actually need professional support, MS Office is clearly the safer bet.

The main reason I give this product only 3 stars (other than the limitations outlined above) is due to the fact that individual users can get what is essentially the same suite of programs that are included in WordPerfect Office X7 for free elsewhere. OpenOffice (Google it) is an open source version of MS Office that includes all of the same programs and features as Corel's version. Due to the fact that it is open source software, it is distributed for free though. I have used this product for a number of years and if anything, I find it to be more stable and better supported than Corel's version. I would offer a list of reasons to buy Corel's version vs the free version, but I honestly can't think of any."
Good product
"Installed program and when re-booted, couldn't get into my computer at all. Called them and was told I would have to go to tech support on line. Told him I couldn't get on line or into my computer and he told me to go to a neighbor's or friend's house! I still wouldn't have been able to correct problem without being at my computer. Had to call Compaq tech support and it cost me $60.00 and 40 minutes to be walked through the fix.

I hate this piece of garbage and am really angry. Hate to see anyone else get taken."
"Oregon Trail is for me the best out of the series. Personal opinion. This was my favorite game as a kid. I remember dying of dysentery so many different times. It is also educational, but only if you want it to be. You don't have to read the facts about the places you stop at but you can and I think that is what is really cool about this game. It makes you think but not too hard. It is really all about the fun you have taking your friends out on the trail with you and perhaps drowning one, letting one get bit by a snake. No matter what you want out of this game you have got it. I loved it as a kid and I love it as a college student :]"
just what I needed to do all my taxes.
Everything it is advertised to be and then some....!
Good program to use if you do not have word. Very easy to use and easy to become familiar with.
I had this for awhile but found something better and use it regularly

"I had Norton but it really slowed my computer down.  I mean it really hogged resources.  And for what?  I've had PC Cillin for a couple of months now and I have't had any problems with viruses at all. The AV protection is really excellent and for a lot less than Norton.  That alone makes it worth the investment. It is fast, has a good auto update feature for the AV and firewall along with a GREAT spam feature (Turn it up to its highest setting and then start building a white list)that I love, since it has decreased my spam by about 90%.  With the White List, you can dump almost all your spam into a spam folder and delete it all without clicking on it (a quick browse will suffice to see if there are any real messages) and spam will rapidly decrease. A good trick is to sort the spam by sender making it easier to spot any missed messages and to add the senders to the white list. There's also a black list, which I have found helpful.

As far as the spyware detection goes, it could be better, but it really isn't bad at all.  I'm sure it picks up the real nasty ones out there and my computer speed stays quick and consistent, so I know it is working more than some of the negative posters have said.  I have Ad Aware professional and even it doesn't pick up everything.  I would just download and use SpyBot Search and Destroy and run it once a week along with the free AdAware.  The Anti Virus feature of PC Cillin is quite exceptional for the price you will pay and that, I will say again, is alone worth the price of the PC Cillin product.

The PC Cillin interface is easy to use. I have had no problems with the auto updates and the firewall offers the same settings for whatever environment you are working in that Norton does, such as at the airport or at home.  I tested the firewall with a couple of online firewall testers and they didn't find any open ports.

There is more to write about this product, but I will end with saying that I would recommend it if you are an average or business user and need basic to intermediate protection from hackers, as most of us do.  If you are at real risk from attacks, then you might want to get something like Norton, but then you would also probably be able to afford a machine or network system that could handle the unbelievable resource hogging that Norton subjects your system to."
"I use Parallels with Windows 7 because I have to use AutoCAD and Revit. I know that performance might be better using Boot Camp, but I much prefer to run Mac and Windows programs simultaneously.

"As a first time ""do-it-myselfer"" I have to admit I was a little nervous.  However I think Turbotax did a great job of walking me through every step.  Gives you the option of going slowly and understanding each step, or skipping to the topics you need to get to.  My situation is not complicated, so this may be part of why I had such an easy time.  However I would still highly recommend this product to anyone who is willing to tackle their taxes on their own."
Works good
"it is a good product for getting familar with hearing and trying to speak another language.
pros: it was easy to use
cons: waaaaayyyyyy waaaayyyy wwwwaaaayyyyy too expensive
i bought this to supplement my daughter's classwork and, with all of the electronic gadgetry available, it was a bit limiting to only have the option of using it from a computer or CD player.  I haven't used similar products but did find online courses which were free.  If you gotta sit in front of a computer anyway, free beats $$$$$$$ hands down!"
"My kids had expressed an interest in learnig a foreign language and I was curious about the ""immersion method"" so I got this software. Each language has 2 CDs. ""Talk Now!"" deals with basic words, much like how we learned English in grade school. Spelling in English and chosen language is provided. The kids like the format because it is presented in a game show fashion.  The other CD ""World Talk"" is more advanced, using conversational sentences which beginners would not understand if you haven't picked up some elementary words. It does give out clues but no translation in English. Pros: This program will teach you how to speak by repetition and visual recognition of objects and is excellent for beginners. You can also print out a picture dictionary and exercises and record your voice. Cons: No explanation of pronounciation, grammar, or spelling. Same words and graphics for all four languages. Overall, a great program with no glitches, entertaining, and excellent introduction to foreign language."
"I am a student of Linux. I have to put in the effort of learning Linux, this DVD is a good tool."
Particularly nice for use on small laptops and notebooks which give you a larger format than most Kindles without buying another computer.
Works great when I have to answer many emails! I like talking to my computer. My family thinks I'm nuts!
"This is the last version before Microsoft introduced that horrible ribbon, a user interface so bad it needs a search engine. Open Office is nearly as good and it's free, but if you need 100% Microsoft Office compatibility and don't want your computer to treat you like a semi-literate who can't read a menu, this is what you want."

"My 4-year old son loves this program and has been playing it for over a year on a Windows PC.  It runs fine under Windows XP.  However, I bought an iMac thinking that it would be a better platform to run games, but so far every Reader Rabbit title that we own has choppy audio when running on the Mac.  I've scoured the Internet looking for help but none to be found. Can't even find out who the real author of this software is, as there is no web site for The Learning Company (the URL goes to Broderbund Software, but no help available there either).  It's a good thing the software is cheap, since if it doesn't work your only recourse is the trash can!"
It didn't work
"I've used Access for years at home.  I use it for inventory of what we own, for fire, theft etc.  I use it for keeping track of what we've read, authors we like or don't.  I also use it for names, address's.  Since I'm a very senior citizen I have to admit it took some getting used to.  Would I buy it again, absolutely!"
Why would anyone buy the download from Amazon when you can buy the full version disk at Sam's for less??
I am uninstalling quicken 14 and going back to an earlier version.  I have spent eleven hours talking with Quicken and various supervisors..bill pay people.. tech support etc and cannot pay my bills through the 2014 software. I hate it and would love to find another software program aside from Quicken.  No one can solve the issue and one tech support guy said to wait for an upgrade or for a new total program...2015??? He said there were too many problems and they cant be solved with the existing software.. Other support techs have tried everything over and over again with no solution and now I cant even get the download from my bank...sooo very very unhappy and am not interested in any more Qujicken programs..
"I recently purchased Office 2013 because I got a new iMac. I was using Thunderbird, so I didn't think I would need Outlook and bought Office without it, thinking I could always buy it separately later. When I did decide to buy it, I discovered that Microsoft won't allow you to purchase Outlook separately for Mac, or to upgrade your copy of Office to include it. If you have Office for Windows, you can buy Outlook separately. But if you are a Mac owner, Microsoft wants you to buy Office all over again, this time with Outlook. So that's $140 for Office to begin with, and then another $240 for a second copy of Office, this time with Outlook. They don't warn you about this anywhere on the Microsoft website. Kind of a ripoff."
This software meets all of our expectations.  It is very good especially if you need corporate tax returns completed.

"My two daughters (ages 7 and 9) and I just finished playing this wonderful computer game.  We all contributed to the successful conclusion of the game, too; each of us noticed different clues, or remembered certain details.  The game is ""G"" rated, and definitely appropriate for school-age children, yet exciting enough to keep adults involved, and not at all babyish.  It was hard to tear ourselves away from the game at the conclusion of each day!  We are anxious to try the other two games in this series, and I sincerely hope that the company makes many more."
"Very unhappy.  After entering many hours of data, the program synchronized with Ancestry.com and wiped out a number of people entirely from both programs."
"Dreamweaver may seem like a novice's dream come true, but it's quite the opposite. For one thing, not only does it create messy, convoluted code; it creates code that does not conform to the HTML standard! It doesn't even insert a DOCTYPE declaration, a *must* even if the rest of the HTML is not entirely correct.
If all you're doing is a quick, simple page, the HTML required can be learned in the 5 minutes it takes to get used to this program. Or, if you are designing anything more, you will run into its limitations and bloated code very quickly."
LOVE IT
"As a beginning small business last Spring, Intuit's quickbooks has been a godsend.  It is intuitive to use and it really helps me track customer invoices as well as expenses and payments.  I use the customer site for all contact information which makes it easier to follow-up with clients for new business and opportunities. And the price for a startup business was within my budget--very affordable!"
Ty my problem was fixed
"We established our AVG account per instructions and followed the instructions from the disk. There were no problems downloading or updating the computer.  AVG told us that we had 2 years on the product.  After it was done loading we opened AVG on the computer and it told us that we had 6 days left.  We called AVG for assistance and were told that we had a bootleg/3rd party software and it wasn't theirs.  They insisted on looking at the computer files and behold, they found that the software must have loaded ransomeware and many viruses on the machine. For $200 we can purchase their product and have long-term assistance from them.  Oh, we can pay $100 and get one-time help, but then they cannot help us after that.  This was not the first time that we received this sales pitch.  BEWARE, they want payment imediately and the person you talk to sees your credit card information.  NOPE!  Now we have purchased, loaded, and registered it but we will probably go with Mcafee next time.  Learn from our lesson please."
"I first started using Quicken back with the 2010 Starter edition and it always seemed a little behind with the ""new"" ways of doing User Interfaces. It was never user friendly to me and it took a long time to get used to all the little in and outs of the software. I have been using 2013 for about 2 hours today and I love it so far. Everything you see is just slightly sleeker but still in the same area that I got used to in the older version of the program.

Converting my quicken data from the 2010 way of doing things to the 2013 format also ran into no issues. It seems like they have fixed the migration problem with password secured files that I heard so much about in some of the other reviews.

I had no problems setting up the app on my phone and getting web sync working and having the cloud sync will be very nice. In just a few quick minutes I had a new cloud id and I was signed in on my phone and able to see all my spending account details. Hopefully they will continue to improve on the types of accounts you can see on the phone(like investment or 401k accounts) but this seems like a great direction for it to be going in. I am really glad I decided to give Quicken another chance before switching to Mint.com or another similar service.

There are still some little things I find weird with this software but there were all issues I had back in 2010(like Ctrl-A doesn't select all and opens the Account list window instead). So far I haven't used it enough to see if they fixed/improved on some of the more intricate problems I was having in 2010 but so far so good."
Loaded and worked fine - only solution available for a unique printer issue.
Great for beginners. It's lots of fun to draw and there isn't an insane amount of tools and technical stuff you should know before hand in order to use properly. NOT recommended if you're a serious (or even semi-serious) artist.
"I've used Turbo Tax for years. Last year was a little weak, but this year's addition of Product Activation cinched it for me. I'm not a hacker or a pirate, but Product Activation had previously turned my Office XP upgrade from a 30-minute exercise to an all-day nightmare. Product Activation is bad news for legitimate consumers and less than an annoyance to hackers, who have already cracked it.
I switched to Tax Cut. It works beautifully, costs less, and imported my prior year's TurboTax data flawlessly. I recommend other buyers do the same."
"I love it!  Peachtree is a great program that I have been using for my business accounting since 2001. As I'm not anxious to switch up to the newer Sage versions I bought the 2010 Complete and it runs wonderfully well and is easy to access from my networked computers. It flawlessly migrated from XP to Win7 Pro which is one of the reasons I chose the 2010.

My favorite feature in the Peachtree Complete 2010 is being able to switch to ""Customer Management"" while having an invoice open and being able to see the history of a customer - jobs, product, price....I used to have to pull up a history page and guess.
Another feature of Peachtree is it allows me to set up to five different price levels for an item and select a level for each customer so that when an item is input, the price automatically inserts on the invoice (which can be changed of course).
Having used a Specially designed multi-thousand $ business program for years, and then using QuickBooks at another company, I decided on buying Peachtree for my own company and am so glad I did. Peachtree is the closest business accounting software on the market to the specially designed mega-$ one IMHO of course."
"I hate doing my taxes. No, I'm not one of those people who hate taxes themselves, I just hate preparing the return. I've used H&R Block software in the past couple years after switching from TurboTax after abysmal performance, errors and updating issues. I've yet to have a bad experience with H&R Block software, even that one year where our tax situation was much trickier than it had ever been before. The previous year's data imported quickly, the whole process of inputting everything was smooth and easy, and the e-file went flawlessly. The only thing I don't like about it is you have to pay separately for the state e-file, but since I purchased this on a daily deal with Amazon, the cost worked out comparably to purchasing it in a brick and mortar store. We received our refunds as expected and we're done for yet another year."
"Do not purchase! Avoid!

Has a ""Operations in progress"" error which Acronis support knows about and claims is working as intended. Numerous users are affected. This error will freeze the software, force closing, only results in it booting up into the same process. These processes continue to run and use up system resources. Do not purchase this product as eventually it will lock up and you will lose your backup and go through several technical work-arounds to get it functioning again. Numerous users reporting this issue with no fixes, since 2014. The worse issue is that Acronis acknowledges this problem and claims that it is an intended feature."
"I have been using this program for 4 months. I purchased a new computer and loaded this program as a low cost  alternative to MS Office. The program has worked great. I've used it for spreadsheets, documents and it has been great. I highly recommend this."
"Tech support drove me crazy with tutorials to fix stop running problem. Had me doing things that took hours on the phone trying to understand what they wanted me to check with foreign accents. After 3 months of emailing, I gave up ....

Buy Wondershare simple to use!!!! On installation the program immediately told me there was a script running in the back ground that we cause the soft ware to stop running, couple of minutes later I was burning DVDs!!!"
"I have been using TurboTax for over 20 years - using both Basic and Deluxe - and they used to meet all my needs.  While preparing my taxes for 2014 I all of a sudden find out that I cannot do my K-1's and Schedule D with the Deluxe and have to pay around $35.00 for the Premier upgrade in the middle of my tax preparations.  Talk about an underhanded move that undermines their credibility - what trick will they play next to gouge the consumer?  I've had it with TurboTax - time to try something else.  Understand that H&R Bock has a good product, so will give them a try for 2015.  Sorry to say good-by to TurboTax, but what they did to me was highly disturbing."
"Parallels is awesome, I love it and it is there for me anytime I can't find a Mac version of software that I own or need to own but is only available in Windows.

I don't play a lot of games, but my friends do play low frame rate games in Parrallels with little issue.

You do need a OEM copy of Windows to setup a virtual machine, but once the first one is installed, activated, and updated you can clone and backup that virtual machine and have multiple versions of windows installed, one for home one for work.

I own a Macbook pro and have easily been able to find all drivers for all of the hardware on the Mac so it shows up in Windows under Parallels (many coming from the Apple Bootcamp Disk). I also have Bootcamp installed but do not use it at all after I purchased Parallels unless I want to run a high frame rate game.

The only thing I don't like about it, but is a drawback to any virtual machine, is the space consumption on the hardrive and that Mac Partitions are not accessible from Windows."
"I wrote a review when I first used the 2011 version, and then erased it. I just went back to modify my Health Care Proxy, which is one of the documents this software provides in addition to the Will. I had forgotten how cumbersome it is to navigate through the meager 4 or 5 pages of this document, and how difficult it is to print. Without counting print pages carefully (and it's very cumbersome to that in their layout), you'll waste alot of paper.

I also find the ""help"" and suggestions for dealing with issues in the Health Care Proxy or the Will itself, to have a downside. It's supposed to give you an example, but if you don't think of things in detail for yourself, it will only open a can of worms, confuse you and result in awkward and inadequate statements of intent. So in the end I wonder, what good is this software, if it's always telling you to seek legal advice, you have to think long and hard about all your stuff and what to say and not say, and it's an absolute bear to print out? The answer must be, it's cheap and has the veneer of legal validity, it provides a framework I guess. Others seem to like it, and in fact I'm using it for now, but it could be better.

I find Intuit software in general, to not be a good organizing tool, but something you need to not let organize you, while you make the effort to organize yourself. The big example here is Quicken, I have an old 2000 version and it's really just a register for you to input finances, not an organizing or accounting tool at all. Again, I'm referring to the 2000 version. It's not enough to just enter all your transactions over the years, you have to summarize things, but it's not that good at doing that."
"I'm OK with NX2, but the old version had a ""sharpness"" feature which was very easy to use to bring slightly out of focus pictures better into focus.  I haven't been able to locate the feature on NX2."
I've tried others but come back to Microsoft. It seems to be tried and trusted.
"I received the Basic edition bundled with a very nice Plextor burner. Most of my experience so far has been with the EMC 7 Capture function.

The bundle itself is truly bloatware, and loads tons of stuff that you will never use. It would be nice if places like Roxio would add a one-line description of each useless package's function, with the option to install or not after reading.

Capture is the kind of program designed to be ""easy"", meaning you never really know what is happening. It does (mostly) capture video. However, it will hang periodically with cryptic messages, to which the only option is click ""OK"". Then it starts over from the beginning.

The Smartscan feature would theoretically be great (you must make sure your DV camera supports this function). My cam (PV-GS200) does. However, the purpose of Smartscan is to fast-forward looking for scene codes on the tape, to let you preselect the scenes you want to capture. Unfortunately, it gets lost, a lot. Once Capture has lost its place, the only option is to start back over at the beginning of the tape. It will invariably hang at the same places, so after wasting a LOT of time and over-exercising the fragile tape, you will give up and just Capture the whole damned tape (have a very big hard drive handy).

Now that you're capturing the full tape, it will hang in other places. It hates when you have fast-forwarded the tape in camera, because that causes a black frame that it cannot seem to move past. Eventually, you will find that the best option is to manually move past the spot with the controls on your camera, then start capturing from there... but you will never really know what the software is doing until its over.

Never knowing what the program is doing, and having neither options nor meaningful Help when difficulties are encountered, is the recurring theme of this whole software suite. The only Help you will get from Roxio is their user forum (which is pretty good); otherwise, their idea of support is to try to get you to buy an upgrade version.

I believe much of this stems from trying to make something which is still inherently complex (video capture) overly simple for some perceived grandparental audience. The problem with all the friendly screens is that they blithely assume nothing will fail. When problems inevitably arise, there is no recovery other than Start Over. You will never know where you are in a tape, where your restart begins, what happened to the video you may or may not have already captured, or what to do to manually jumpstart a stalled capture.

The same look and similar issues were thoughtfully embedded in the Videowave authoring suite, although I have not had much experience with it, given that I am spending most of my time capturing and recapturing (I think).

I am not sophisticated enough to recommend something else yet, but there has to be something better and I would recommend you find it instead of anything from Roxio. Their whole progression as a software megabundler has been toward sales and away from functionality (and support) and it is really a shame that a first-class outfit like Plextor had to ""partner"" with them."
"We used this map on a canoeing trip out of Atikokan Ontario.  Very detailed and helpful on navigating water and portages, though some well-defined portage trails were unmarked.  It would have been nice to get some water depth data with the topo card."
"I'm not a numbers person. However, everybody has to keep track of bills and such, and with being a small business owner, I had extra challenges to work with. So I jumped at a chance to give this program a shot. I'm glad I did.

I think the thing I like about it most is the layout. I know some people are not so impressed, but being someone who took to Office 2007 like a duck to water, I'm two for two on MS's newer programs. I found it easy to navigate, and had little trouble figuring out where everything's supposed to be. And, as with Office, I like the bells and whistles--they make things easier, at least for me.

I didn't notice much of a problem with things loading, though that may be because I have a newer computer. There are still some features I haven't used yet (including ones that cost extra) but so far, so good!"
"It is a good program.  Very simple to use. Printing is also simple. You need to always insert the Program disc, but that is ok, I am willing to do that because the program is so easy to use. Bought this on Amazon."
This works as expected. Only disappointment is apparent in product purchases that muddy the waters about what I can use and what is a pay part.
"As a stocking stuffer or small gift for a real animal lover in the household, this incredibly inexpensive offering is worth the price.  If you already have larger Corel Galleries it won't add anything significant to  your collection.  Indeed, a few of the images even come with CorelDraw.  But  the price makes this a good enough buy for those people in your life  who really like animals enough to enjoy this animals-only production.  This  would also be a fantastic collection of art to introduce smaller children  to graphical software.  The photos here would make excellent practice  images for kids learning to do photo manipulation in Corel PhotoPaint or  Adobe Photoshop."
"I regret that I bought this product. The entire stack seems very buggy. The video tape I'm trying to digitize is somewhat old and with poor quality, and this causes the Dazzle to bail out. This happens sometimes with my KiSS PVR as well, say after an hour or so. The Dazzle didn't keep the sync for more than 2 minutes."
"I had to buy a floppy drive to install it. It comes on 6 floppies.
Old graphics, bank list outdated, seems to work ok, but I will continue
to use the MS Works for 97 spreadsheet (like xcel)."
"I have a very high end Mac Pro and bought Toast Titanium Pro in a bundle with an external Blu-Ray burner.  Every time I click the mouse in Toast, I get a spinning beach ball for 30 seconds.  I upgraded to the latest version of Toast.  This is a system with a very fast disk array and 24 GB of RAM.  Everything flies except for Toast.

Do not buy this or bundles with it; it's a total waste of money.

Update Nov 2010 -- Well, something changed or the newest version of Toast fixes the problem I was having.  In any event, I am finally able to use Toast to burn blu-ray discs."
"I have used turbo tax for 3 years for personal use, including an LLC.  However, now I have a newly formed S corp. We have no income yet, so the return was fairly simple. (don't know how it would be for more complex) It worked well, except there is no link between the Home & Business version and the version.  So, you have to manually key in Schedule K information.  There should definitely be an import/export feature.  It is ridiculous that the same vendor doesn't interface their own products.

There were several negative reviews on the product, but by the time I used it, Intuit had fixed the bugs."
Terrible software. Go with AVAST!
Havent used product yet.. looks like a great product system to do all things audio related... I will use it eventually
Not bad
"This game is so amazing because it brings the otome games to the PCs!!! Cuz of it, now I don't have to play otome games in a PSP, I can play it in any computer with windows XP,7,Vista in Japanese!"
Very good and knowledgeable.  Works well every time.
"I am severely disappointed with Intuit and Amazon due to the fact that not only do they charge seventy dollars for this application, they also charge twenty on top for state e-file and get away with it by hiding that under the fine print.

My advice to you as someone who was burned by them is to use a much superior service like taxact.com who provides state and federal e-file for only $20.

I will never, ever, purchase another intuit program again.

Buyer beware."
"Over the past 15 years, I have really loved Power DVD product.  It was perfect for doing what I wanted it to do, when I wanted it to do it.  This latest version changed the file associations on the PC I installed it on and did not give me the choice to opt out.  I had to uninstall the program, then reinstall another DVD player of choice.

The 10 GB of cloud space is very generous, but it does not make up for the monumental pain in the @$$ that the program caused on installation. Cyberlink NEEDS TO FIX THIS ISSUE!  I would not recommend installing this on a machine you do any sort of creative / video editing work on.  Be careful!"
"I've used Turbotax since it was first released but now they want to rip off loyal customers.  Yes, it's a good product but deceptive advertisers will never get my business.  I'll switch to TaxCut unless they're playing the same one-return game this year - you don't think that they would conspire, do you?  Ha!"
"Have used Quicken on Windows for more than 12 years.  It was a good program.  Bought a Mac and installed the Quicken for Mac 2015.  It is almost useless.  One of the more useful Quicken features, Check Writing, is not available.  If you download it from Amazon's site, you cannot return it."
"I have been using card factory for several years.  It is my hands down favorite card software.  I've used most of the others and I always go back to the card factory.  I too have the newest version, (version 7) the dvd that is compatable with vista.  I did have to download the patch,  but after that it worked fine.  The choices are beautiful and varied...especially the flower section, but not just that! I make cards all the time and people always say they are awesome.  You do not need to be connected to the internet to use this and I appreciate that. The only thing I'm not as happy with is the search option. With the older versions, you typed in a word and up came all in that catagory.  With this version, you type in the word and have to keep clicking on each seperate catagory to see if there is anything in it that matches what you typed in.  I don't know if that's a problem with the card factory,  or with vista.  But I like card factory so much that I can live with this minor problem. I find it very easy to use.  All in all,  I give it an A+"
Does most things I want for editting photos and movies. I like the Rename Tool for my photos. I wish the collage feature was easier to use.
"Essential to reinstall this Genealogy program, which is not ;longer available from the Mromon Library !!!
It was in good condition."
"Ridiculous.  I bought it because the mac version is so buggy.  Running it on Windows on Parallels. All bought specifically to make this work, and I can't even activate it."
Can not get it to print!! Try get help many time no help at all!! Sorry I bought it.
"It really bugs me to see or hear so called professional web designers complain about web design software. If you truely are a professional, then you should be quite capable of breaking out the old MS NotePad or WordPad to re-edit any of the program's output to suit your needs. Now with that being said ...

The last time I tried to do this HTML stuff was back when the W3C standard was HTML 3.2. The standard is currently 5.0 and many things have changed. At the time I stopped designing websites, CSS was still new and XML was still an experiment. Which means that I have a whole bunch of catching up to do before I can even attempt to edit my own HTML again.

I wanted a WYSIWYG web design program that would work much like the old MS FrontPage software from back in the day. The Serif WebPlus X5 appeared to fit that bill and it was quite reasonably priced here at Amazon. My heart was set on the MS web design software but the price kept going up and that software is quite old. So the Serif WebPlus X5 was the next best choice.

At first I wasn't crazy about the software but then the realization hit me that the Serif WebPlus X5 works more like desktop publishing program rather than an HTML editor. After that realization things became much easier to handle.

I am not crazy about not being able to change the HTML output from inside of the program but as it was with the old FrontPage software, I'd just have to make those changes using MS NotePad or WordPad. You can add HTML and Javascript ""code snippits"" from within the program but you can't change any of the Serif created coding. Not a real big problem to overcome.

I am a little disappointed that the program is still using the W3C 4.1 standard for it's HTML output. The program isn't very old and I would have liked it better if it was using the newer 5.0 standard. However, the site that I've created does display correctly in the 3 browsers that I have installed on my computer (MS IE8, Firefox, and Google Chrome). That sure beats the old days where one went crazy trying to code for all of the different browsers.

For the newcomer to web design, this Serif WebPlus X5 software is exactly what you need. If you know how to use desktop publishing software then you will easily be able to get your website created and published it to the web with the 'built in' FTP program in no time flat.

You can publish your site to any web server that your site is hosted on. Statements made about being ""married"" to Serif's web server are quite untrue. Sure you won't be able to use the ""Smart Objects"" tool to add things like a guestbook, forum, blog, chat, or counter because that ""Smart Objects"" tool is related to the Serif web hosting server. However, there are plenty of HTML and Javascript ""code snippits"" available on the web that will help you in the creation of such objects or pages.

I highly recommend the Serif WebPlus X5 for all users of any skill level. From the beginner to the (cough, cough) professional this software does get the job done and done quite well."
ok
I was having issues with my computer I put this on it and it fixed most of my issues .
"Like many others who reviewed this DVD set, I took a class at Front Sight where I learned the fundamentals. If I lived in the Las Vegas area and could take remedial classes frequently, I would have little need for this set, but since I can't, this encyclopedia of handgun accuracy is the best alternative. Patrick is wordy, as another reviewer observed, but the messages are clear and understandable. Study and practice - including a heavy reliance on dry fire - should make you a better shooter. However, I strongly recommend not relying on any DVD set alone, as you might not be able to recognize where your problems are. Instructor-led training & coaching should be a component of any serious plan for improving handgun skills, along with this set. It's best in class for DVDs and I could have given it 5 stars for that, but I think all the 5 star reviews might suggest this is all you need, when it isn't. I always read the worst reviews first, so I'm hoping that by giving it just 4 stars, my review will get read."
We use System Suite 9 daily to maintain and clean up all of our PC's and laptops.  It does a great job in all of its functions and is a useful software for upkeep of computers.
I use it alot.
"I purchased from this seller and attempted to load it on to a laptop.  I was unable to get the key to work.  Unfortunately I did not have access to the laptop until after the 30 day return policy expired.  I contacted Microsoft directly and they stated the key I was using was for multiple computers and the maximum number of users has been met.  When you purchase you are not getting a key for one computer, it is a shared key they are selling over and over again.  That is why it is so cheap.  I thought nothing of it when I received it because it was sealed in plastic.  Save yourself the headache and buy from Microsoft."
"I had the following problems with TurboTax Premier 2012:
1) One inactive cell.  On one occasion, TubroTax had a prompt asking for a number to be entered in a highlighted cell, but the cell was inactive and would not accept any entry.  This single dead cell resulted in a return with an error, and TurboTax as a result would not file my returns despite lengthy efforts.
2) The step-by-step instructions on filing K-1 forms are muddled to the point of being impossible (for me) to use -- even after repeated attempts.  Twice TurboTax asked for information that went beyond that provided on my K-1 form itself, and which I had no idea how to answer.  One prompt suggested something like ""enter negative one in column A"".  I had no idea to what the prompt was referring.
3) TurboTax reported one discrepancy in values between those on my Federal and State returns although the values on my State return were loaded by TubroTax itself from my Federal return that TurboTax had just prepared.  Though unlikely, it seemed possible that the discrepancy was generated by TurboTax itself.
4) One error message (#3 above) offered no clear (to me) indication of where the error was occurring or how it might be fixed.
5) No useful help was available to trouble-shoot any of the difficulties above."
"It is a very helpful introduction to Amharic pronounciation, as it is interactive, and can correct you if you pronounce the words incorrectly. It doesn't teach you the Amharic syllabary/alphabet, but it has many features like speech recording, which compares your pronounciation to the speakers on the CD, many words to learn and a dictionary which you can print. A good choice for beginners."
"H O R R I B L E! My property management company uses this software and it's the main reason I'm dropping that management company. It takes forever for me to get paid! The property management software shows I was paid on the 7th of February. Today is the 15th of February and I STILL HAVE NOT BEEN PAID, EVEN THOUGH MY TENANT FAITHFULLY PAYS ON THE FIRST.
I hate Rent Manager. If you're a commercial property manager, be aware that homeowners hate it. Do you really want to anger your valuable clients with this junk thing?"
Product works well and was easy to load. I still prefer to have the disc for assurance.
"I have been using the Intuit products for well over a decade.  I'm also a geezer.  Like many of you, I have 20+ financial accounts with 10's of thousands historic transactions.  I usually stay one year back on the Quicken upgrades, but pulled the trigger for 2014 due to the planned obsolescence of Q11 and relatively low cost of the Amazon download.  Unlike some of the poor folks that had trouble with the download and subsequent issues, I was up and running with a completely accurate transition (I did check) in about 30 minutes using a 12MB DSL download stream.  It probably should have been faster, but I'm slow and actually read the prompts.  Note that I don't use the Android/cloud capabilities however (I still use a flip phone and have never sent a text msg).  So far, Q14 functions exactly like Q11 and yes, I have done the one step update already with no issues.  Bottom line...install/transition is a piece of cake, but I don't see anything extra yet that is really cool.  I will say that the Intuit products have made my life easier over the years despite occasional bugs.  I really like the Quicken to TurboTax linkage."
100%
have several brokerage accounts...when i added all the 1099s the whole software became soon slow it became unusable to complete my return..
"I believe, no comments required for the windows lovers, though windows 8 is now launched in the markets. Its really good."
"I buy a new version of QB every three years since features I need discontinue after three years in the older version. I have yet to see a meaningful improvement of the program itself in 6 years.

Last year I wrote to the head of Intuit and asked for a report that gives stock and sales for a given period. Someone called and said we're listening, it will be in the 2012 edition. But of course it wasn't. This is such a basic report that it amazes me they don't have it.

Instead the ""improvements"" are token at best each year, and more oriented to generating more revenue for the company. I'm now stuck with QB since it will be too much of a hassle to move to another program. That said, it is easy to use."
I gave up my expensive CPA for TurbTax. I have used it for the past two tax seasons. Very easy to use if you don't have a complicated return.
"Downloaded this... was never able to install on my Mac.  Won't let me enter the code and says ""quit unexpectedly"".  Waste of time and money.  Couldn't get refund."
"The best thing to happen to writing since the invention of the typewriter!

By taking several of the most common workflows, and grouping them into one piece of software, Scrivener has dropped the number of open applications I use to write from 5 to 2.

The only thing that could make it better would be an internal web browser (so I don't have to keep switching windows to look something up on the internet).

Other than that, it's amazing!"
"never a problem , but i have pretty simple taxes !"
"I just started playing with the free trial of the Topaz Bundle a few days ago, but liked it so much right from the start, that I bought it.

For years, I've been resisting doing much in the way of processing my images, other than a crop, a little sharpening, and a resize for the web.  Now that I've discovered Topaz however, boy has that changed.  I find myself sitting in front of my computer for hours, just testing and tweaking with the various (and many) filters available.

The bundle gives you so much to choose from, and I'm really impressed.  There are videos and tutorials on the Topaz Website, and even a Flickr group devoted to Topaz.

I highly recommend this product if you want to make your workflow go smoothly, and much faster than trying to obtain these results manually.  It's easy, and it's FUN!!!"
"Purchased this on Apple Store.  As mentioned by other reviewer, the charts no longer work properly.  They actually no longer sell this product on Apple Store, and if you purchased from Apple Store you are not eligible for the upgrade rebate according to their FAQs.

I would rate this product a 5 star program for the price, with a 0 star business practice.  Would have a hard time buying it again with no clarity of the direction they will choose to go in the future and not know if they would even support prior customers past next week."
"The product should really get zero stars, but that wasn't an option.  How can a company that produced such a great product in the past come out with software that is virtually unusable?  The incompetence of the software developers is simply breathtaking.  Too many features don't work, some best features of the previous versions were left out.  They got arrogant and didn't listen to their end users before coming out with a new version.  Companies that do this to their end users end up going out of business - it wouldn't surprise me if they do.  As of late December 2011, there's a backlog of refund requests at the Printshop site.  See the link below to their forums.

"Being able to have all of my past tax information carried over from year to year, to be guided step by step to enter my current information, and to have a running total of how much tax I must pay or the refund I'll receive always let's me know where we stand.  It also lets me make decisions about the choices I choose when I have a choice.  I've been using TurboTax for many years, and am always satisfied with the outcome. My wife has a home business using part of our home as her only place of business, and TurboTax keeps us up to date."

"In regards to Acronis Disk Director Suite, v. 10.0. I have been struggling with this product for over 2 years now. I admit that I am not the brightest bulb in the town and other people probably have no trouble using DD....which really scares me.
So I had to get this off my chest.
DD Ste. v. 10.0 is, in my opinion, grotesquely unintuitive. Maybe they just want to sell tech support to their users?
A more logical reason may be that the syntax gets lost in the translation, if indeed DD Ste. v. 10.0 is made overseas.
In any case; software companies like Acronis, should realize that people don't have the time to learn programs that are written with inscrutable dialog.
When I buy software now, the main criterion is ""Ease of Use"". Unless that gets a perfect review; I won't buy it and even then I trial it for intuitiveness.
Thanks."
"I've been using Quicken for about 15 years and am highly upset about their move to a subscription based model. No subscription, you can't have your data. That's it, I'm done with Quicken.

To my pleasant surprise, Moneydance was able to import all of my Quicken data without a hitch. While the interface is different, it only takes a few minutes to get used to the new format. After a short time, I think Moneydance is better. I like the summary page - everything I want to see is there. The reports are available on the sidebar, which is handy.

The investments summary page also has everything I want to see in one presentation - including an asset allocation chart, current value, and % change.

As for an earlier reviewer who didn't like Moneydance's input screen asking for account number and routing info, you don't need to fill that in. Just enter the username and password and Moneydance will grab the info for you.

Moneydance also has some nice programming hooks if you want to expand beyond it's initial capabilities. For example, you can run a Python script or download an extension. Moneydance is also available in Linux (check their website).

The software isn't perfect and some of my banks are not supported by Moneydance directly. However, all these websites do indeed support download by QFX, which Moneydance will handle without a problem. This is not a problem for me, as my Quicken file was already broken and I was doing this anyway as a work-around for Quicken's poor product quality. (Starting from a clean Quicken file does not help. It's Quicken's servers.)"

"Do not, under any circumstances, buy this software! It has been a source of frustration from day one! First, this software has serious memory problems. It cannot run smoothly and froze my computer on a regular basis. The fact that I have a new Sony VIAO with all the bells and whistles, and the fact that subsequent video editing software run perfectly, has to point to an inefficient memory use by this software. Also, the videos that I tried to edit were your plain vanilla family trip clips, nothing extraordinary. Still this software couldn't handle them.

To add insult to injury, this software is full of locked features, yes even at that price! For example, if you want MPEG-4 computability, you need to purchase additional drivers ($10). If you want to use MP3 files, you need to purchase additional drivers. MP3? Isn't that an industry standard? Anyway the list of ""premium"" locked features goes on and on, even downloading the latest patch (9.4 at the time of this writing) doesn't help.

There are other serious flaws with this software, primarily around burning the DVD's. I can't fully report on these since unfortunately I only got to briefly sample these issues. Why you might ask? Because my computer kept on freezing before I ever got to finish editing the movie..."

"I get my internet from Cox, so originally I used the free McAfee they provided until my PC was infected and frozen. Office Max cleaned my PC and told me the McAfee I had was not good enough (DAH!). They sold me a better version of McAfee. When it was up for renewal, I researched the internet. Webroot was highly rated by CNET, PC Magazine and others. When I first loaded Webroot I think it found three threats that McAfee either did not find or did not stop. I have been using Webroot for three years with no problems. It has stopped or eliminated 30+ threats. It also takes up very little space on my computer and scans take less than five minutes. I can't imagine internet security being any better than this."
"This item arrived as a floppy disk!  It does not say anywhere in the description that it is a floppy disk.  Also, they only sent chapters 1-4, not 1-8.  So even if we could run the program, we still wouldn't have it all available.  We will be sending it back for a refund..."

"I've been using this Rosetta Stone program for about three months now. Overall, I am very pleased with it. The program's interface is well-designed, I've experienced no bugs or glitches, and I am making progress faster than I thought I would (or at least I think I am).

Rosetta Stone's method is based on a technique called ""Dynamic Immersion."" You're immediately thrown into the language you want to learn -- there's no English allowed. This sounds daunting, but the software starts you off at such a rudimentary level it isn't intimidating.

Thankfully, the app employs a good variety of interactive methods (matching pictures to sentences, writing caption for photos, hearing words and phrases pronounced correctly by native speakers, etc.) so the ""by rote"" factor stays low. Rosetta Stone says its techniques are modeled on how native speakers actually learn their own languages, usually while still kids, and I think that's a good description for what the software delivers. You start with words and then move on to phrases, and then with level two you get to conversations. Level three kicks the conversational up a couple of notches. It's a natural progression.

I think there are people who prefer a more standard ""grammar-first"" approach because they've found in the past that this is what works for them. I imagine there are also people who don't like looking at computer screens for lengthy periods. These are valid concerns. There are different pedagogical approaches for a reason -- not everyone learns in the same way. My guess is that Rosetta Stone would serve the majority of people very well, especially students who are comfortable with computer-based learning. Ideally, I think this program will work best for people who are studying a language using many ""inputs"" (text books, audio programs, computer apps, foreign-language media, foreign flicks, native speakers, etc.) All of these things will ultimately reinforce one another. The more immersion, the better.

I really like how the program keeps track of what areas I'm botching and pulls me back into those areas for more work. I also like the pronunciation practice via the included headset, although I can't verify it's always catching me when I'm mispronouncing things. To my ear I'm doing OK, but my ear isn't the best, hence my use of this program. If I'm pronouncing things badly and the program isn't always catching my errors, I'm not sure how I'd know, if you see what I mean. My hope is that I can nail the rudiments of German and get a good grip on simple conversations using Rosetta Stone before trying to find people to practice with/on, thus keeping my embarrassment factor low.

I'd give the app five stars but I cringe just a little bit at the price. I don't think it is overpriced for what you get, mind you, but the cost -- well, it is what it is. There is a demo on the Rosetta Stone Web site that I encourage you to try before buying. It'll give you a good idea how well this program will work for you. If you like the approach, the price for all three levels is well worth it.

Keep in mind that learning any foreign tongue will realistically take a while. Rosetta Stone shortens the learning period a good deal and makes sticking with the program easier, but it's only a foundation. Still, it's a pretty darn good one, and I can see why it's so popular with people traveling overseas for the first time as well as the international business community."

"I am the the trustee of a family trust which annual proceeds must be distributed to the trust's descendents each year.  This process can only be done with a business edition of software.  I originally used H & R Block Business program but that was a nightmare and would not fill out forms correctly.  I gave up and purchased this product which did my Federal taxes, for the trust, in less than 30 minutes however, when I looked for the State form, which is purchased through a link from the Federal, there was none available for my State of Nebraska and other states.  I spent about an hour waiting and then finally speaking with representative of TurboTax who kept putting me on hold to talk to a supervisor.  Finally she came back and told me that TurboTax does not support State returns in several states, one of them being my state.  This is something they should tell people up front.  It was very good for Federal and I will probably buy it for that next year but at least I will know up front that I will need to fill out the State by hand."

"I thought the Turbo Tax Deluxe would come with the first few years Federal and State filing fee free or at least the first year any way. I was wrong. I paid $50 for the TTD, and still had to pay $20 for filing state, when I could have done the same on the web site for just the cost of filing the state. I would not recommend buying this software."

Hidden greed in the Deluxe version!
"I don't like to give negative reviews. But there is a big difference between what is claimed and what the reality is.

I downloaded the DEMO version of Photoscore Ultimate 7 and gave it a test drive - attempting to transcribe a couple of .mp3 files. Unfortunately, the product failed miserably.

This is very disappointing because Neuratron's PhotoScore is a good product. Thus, I expected the same quality in AudioScore --- no way.

To be fair - the Quick Start Guide states 5 caveats: 1) it can't recognize percussion, 2) has difficulty picking out light higher notes in presence of low heavy ones, 3) Can't separate two instruments playing the same note at the same time, 4) Has difficulty with rhythm in musing with heavy sustain or reverb, 5) It can only handle 16 notes playing at the same time.

My comments:
1) Caveats 2,4, and 5 are killers for me. It rules out about every popular/religious song that I would want to transcribe.

2) Only caveat 5 was mentioned on the web site promotions.

3) The Project screen (where you do the work) presents snippets of wave forms in different colors. The different colors represent different instruments. It's up to you to select them and then assign them to an instrument. The problems are: selection and assignment is unreliable and the snippet colors are not consistent. Thus, you have to struggle to select and play each snippet to see what instrument is should be assigned to. All this must take place before transcription. It is an extremely time consuming process.

4) You have to tell AudioScore the time signature - that's fairly straight forward until you have to line up the vertical bars on the Project screen to indicate which snippets begin or end a new bar.

5) It picks up lots of noise from percussion - making it extremely difficult to sort the snippets.

Bottom line -- as far as transcription from audible music to a score, the limitations rule out general use. The process is too time consuming and fraught with errors. The advertising / claims on the web site grossly overstate the product's ability at this stage.

Avoid it unless you have ridiculously simple music to transcribe."
OMG I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS. My son is in a Spanish immersion school he's 7 so its good for any age . Both of my children as well as myself will be using this program. I plan on buying the entire visual link package. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I would love if they would create a box of flashcards so my children could use as study aides. BUY THIS.
Easy to do nice to get current updates on a regular basis.

"For those of us who need to use applications which run with JAVA (many internet based software do)  Leopard is simply of no use, it does NOT work, its a nightmare.
After consulting by phone with Apple's customer support for abut 40 minutes, and trying to instal a Java update which ended up not working on Leopard, their honest and candid advice was simply to go back and re-install Tiger again as there is, at the moment, no certainty when there will be an available update to correct this problem.
I've been a satisfied Apple user for over 20 years, but this is just too much. Reading through the different internet forums on the subject one learns that Apple found out it had to wait for another 2 month before releasing their new fancy Leopard system in order to have it ready and  Java compatible but that, of course, seems to have been much too long a wait. One wonders if the rush was to benefit their hungry customers of rather to calm the company's thirst for dollars..."
"The Amazon description says Windows 7, but when the package arrived it did not indicate that it would work with Windows 7. We did not install the program because of past bad experiences with products that do not specifically state that it will work with a particular OS.

"When I tried to install it on my computer with Windows 8.1, it gave me a registry error, took me to Broderbunder, but I could never resolve the issue.  I tend to workon regular days and just don't have time for phone tag. Maybe you'll have better luck."
Great
"Like reviewer M. Brown, I find that my proofing takes about 1/4 the time in Omnipage than it did in my previous long-time favorite, ABBYY FineReader!  That's a good thing because the first item I proofed would not export to Word due to an internal ""Invalid Object ID"" Error.  I had to re-proof it from scratch.  So it took a total of 4 hours rather than the 8 I had spent on the same document in ABBYY.

The second large document that I proofed also refused to export due to an ""OPD internal error"", but I got it freed from the bit-prison by saving the ""OPD"" (OmniPage Document), closing, and re-opening.  Then I was able to export.  The next 4 documents exported fine.  I still save my OPD and export to Word frequently -- just in case.  Saving an OPD file is a good opportunity to get up and stretch for a few minutes.

Omnipage made a HUGE advance in character recognition with this release.  I've used several different OCR products and this is by far the best for character recognition. Sometimes 20 to 30 pages will fly by without any manual proofing required. It works well even on very old documents with obsolete fonts and ""blobby"" printing.

Its manual character training ability makes it a breeze to handle special symbols and foreign characters.  But it does not allow you to train it to recognize repeated graphic characters like small star separators.  Nor can you train it to handle combined characters like the Latin ae. There is also a self-training capability.  It detects corrections that you make while proofing and gives you the option of applying similar changes to the rest of the document.

I'm used to having ABBYY OCR the whole document before I proof. In order to effectively use the training capability, you must now proof as it recognizes.  This means you may have to interrupt a job more often with Omnipage.  It does not remember the page you were on when saving (see even more thoughtless user unfriendliness below), but it does recognize and skip pages you've previously proofed when you start proofing again, so you just have to wait for it to get to the right spot if you exit the program then come back.

Pros:
*  Extremely accurate text recognition.
*  Good paragraph layout retention including quoted paragraphs (indented on both sides), right-aligned letter closures, and similar.
*  Handles words from multiple languages in the same document very well.
*  Excellent handling (minimizing) of text styles for export to word.  (ABBYY seems to create a style per paragraph sometimes which makes it almost impossible to do generic reformatting by style.)
*  OPD are treated as a single object by windows rather than the complex file and nested folder structure of the ABBYY saved items.  This makes for much faster backup or delete of these objects.  ABBYY also will not overlay its saved objects - you have to manually delete them.  Omnipage will allow overlay of OPD objects.

Pro and Con
*  Omnipage flags far fewer ""questionable"" text characters than ABBYY does.  That's a real relief since ABBYY seems to flag every standalone 1, I, or l.  On the other hand, a few errors do sneak thru like 111 (for I'll) and // (for italicized If) without being flagged for review.  You will need to scan for common OCR errors in the exported document.

Cons:
* Technical support made me reinstall the product with my anti-virus and all other startup programs turned off to try to solve the Invalid Object ID error, and it did not help.  Maybe the vine version of this program is just a beta and I'm supposed to be beta testing for them?

* OP occasionally decides that one- or two-line sentences at the top or bottom of a page are headers or footers and leaves them out of the export along with the correct headers and footers that you want to leave out.  This means you must manually review every page of the document before finalizing in order to avoid lost text in the output.  (Note that Omnipage correctly OCR's a phrase with the ""one- or two-"" type of structure.  It does not convert them into optional hyphens.)

* Typically, OP creates at least one wrong forced end of paragraph per page.  On a page with lots of short dialog, then most of the actual multi-line paragraphs will get split up into multiple one-line paragraphs.  ABBYY is a bit better in this regard.

* Stay away from work flows unless you like your software to do inexplicable things at the strangest time.  (It's really easier to just remember to manually (1) - acquire pages or open a pdf, (2) - OCR with proofing, and (3) - export.

* The Kindle export workflow did nothing that I was able to discover.  I don't think it even recognized that my Kindle was plugged in.

* OP has the World's Worst user interface I have ever seen.  Honestly, I have many years of computer experience and I've never used a less intuitive application.
 * Page up/down keys do not work in the image or text editor panels.  Why not?  (Neither do cursor keys, nor threats, nor prayers) You have to go over either to little tiny arrows way over in the left hand bottom frame to page up/down or to the edit menu!  Just to page forward!  (To be fair, you shouldn't have to page manually often, but sometimes it is required and every time is a reminder of how inconvenient it is.)
 * Page thumbnails do not synchronize with the page images or editable text panels.  There should be a button to press to show the thumbnail of the current page in the thumbnail panel.  I've never seen a program with a thumbnail list and a full-size panel fail to have this synchronization before, have you?
 * It's way too easy to hit one of the tiny jump to beginning or end of document double arrows when you are trying to hit the tiny page up/down arrows.  Good luck on finding your way back to where you were as there's no jump back button.
 * When you toggle ""show headers/footers"", the option is way up on the left of the screen in the view menu while the headers and footers are on the far right top and bottom.  Why can't you just click in the header/footer or in the body to switch this (like Word).
 *  Short chapter or section numbers or roman numerals are often dropped from recognition even if they are not at the top or bottom of a page.  This is something else you have to manually review (like dropped text in a header/footer location) before you export.
 * The recognition zone type is shown as a pretty large graphic icon overlaid on the upper left corner of the zone, which prevents you from seeing the words under it during proofing.
 * There is a fancy graphic help screen (which no doubt dazzled some marketing manager) which shows up first if you press help.  Then you have to find a tiny option in the lower left of that screen to get the ""normal"" windows help dialog with table of contents, search, and index.
 I could go on whining about the many, many little inconveniences of using this program.  The good news is that you rarely have to use anything but the proofing dialog box, and, although it could also be improved, it is serviceable.

Bottom line:  Ignore the aggravations, it does a great job of converting images to text."

My main gripes are:

(1) Kevin's voice was monotonous. Kelly sounded like she was addressing a kindie class, and I felt like slapping her after a while. I'm 70 years old, Kellie, I'm an adult. To give her credit, however, she definitely knows her subject. Consequently, a couple of lessons at a time was all I could ever manage.

(2) The video uses Adobe Air, which is restrictive and unfriendly, as you can't resize the screen to make it more readable. The captions were also too small for my aging eyes.

If these gripes don't bother you, go for it. It's good value for the money."
"Been using the software for years and it keeps going more and more downhill as they add bloat.  The core functionality, a simple image you can restore even the Windows partition with, is spot on and I've only ever had one issue with an older version and that is somewhat my fault for not validating it at the time.  So if you want an image you can periodically backup to an external drive or even to their nice hidden partition on your existing drive it works great.  Just a note, if you do use the hidden partition make sure your files are backed up or obviously a hard drive failure will take those backups out too.  The images have saved me MANY HOURS over the years and a lot of headache so I like the program just for them.

Where it fails miserably is everything else.  I had it briefly doing file backups which worked well, until it started failing with an error message that when clicked goes to Acronis' help page with ""no data is available for this error"".  Lovely.  So I can't trust it for that and will have to use some other software.  It's rollback stuff in the past has been unreliable at best and the interface has gotten slow, ugly, and needs more clicks to do what I want.  After briefly activating the trial of online storage it now forever bugs me at random intervals to go back to using it with no way I can find to tell it to just shut up.  So short version, great at it's most core functionality and miserable at most everything else."
"not happy with the product, after 2 short weeks i was having problems with norton, since then i got rid of i, Amaron.com did nothing to help me with this product.."
It's okay.  Just need to transfer my data into on different computer
"I am not sure what happened to my downloaded copy, but I can't get this program to uninstall! Ever since I downloaded the program I have the computer constantly using up Ram to make this program work. Previous Antivirus company software never gave me this much problems with using resources."
"I have used Office since it was first released aeons ago.  This download version was a problem. I was working away on the airplane when suddenly Word stopped and I was given a new screen;  the option to signup for Office 365 or quit working with Office.  It seems that Microsoft in its greed makes this option come up when it checks for update and there is no internet and declares your Office invalid.  I had a project due. Signed up the the wifi on the plane ($10) went to Amazon and download OfficeMac Home and Student 2011, took almost 2 hours and then could not get it registered.  On landing, Called Office Support where they told me that I could either sign up for the Office 365 subscription Or pay them to fix the problem, Went on for 72 minutes of troubleshooting, asked to talk to a supervisor, after third request was transferred.  While  i was waiting, found the office365.app in the Microsoft  download. The Office supervisor was not willing to fix their problem without charging me until I asked him why Microsoft had embedded the Office 365 app into the download.  He quickly said they would fix the problem but I had to buy yet another copy of Office Mac Home and Student 2011 from them that did not contain the Office365 App. (really? they are sabotaging any non-Microsoft download? Amazon, how do you feel about that?) Microsoft really does not want us to own Office and are taking aggressive measures to force us into monthly payments to Office 365.
  The tech went through my computer and removed of  EVERY Microsoft file (including those in the  library) to undo the damage their programming did...it  took almost another 2 hours.
  Be careful, remove all the office 365apps before you install the download AND do not use automatic update- seems that can mess you up when you are out of wireless range. Microsoft is what you are doing legal???"
"it LOOKS PRETTY

that is all the have going for it.
You see how pathetic rosetta stone is by the theme in their ads now.
I saw a new ad where THE WHOLE TWO MINUTE ad people were dancing and singing/rapping

wow, just wow

anyways there are two options you should try.

""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pimsleur/dp/0743523571/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pimsleur</a>"", they teach you USEFUL phrases, but thats where its usefulness stops. Use this if you are a beginner ONLY.

""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Story-Time-Language-Learning/dp/B005EVJYQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Story Time Language Learning</a>"", this picks up where pimsleur left off. If you try it you'll see what i mean. Even their BASIC program which is 10 lessons is more involved than 30-50 lessons of pimsleur.
They both have VERY similar set up, but ONLY use this program if you have tried another program or if you are a quick learner.

here are the differences between the two:
1) pimsleur starts with a conversation of what you WILL learn. Story time ends with a conversation to test you
2) pimsleur relies on LISTENING. storytime requires that you read along as changing accents in words changes meaning (esta vs sta vs est) (si vs s) (porque vs. por qu)
3) pimsleur just throws somewhat random vocab at you. meaning random verb conjugations, random cities, random scenerios. Story time presents the vocab in the beginning. There is always a theme per ""Story"" that they presente. Its more organized. They present a verb and conjugate it for the specific tense that they use.
4) pimsleur is very limited in that you could probably never be able to hold a short conversation other than, ""hi how are you, very good thanks"". You can't even freaking say ""i'm hungry so i will eat an apple"" at the end of pimsleur. (If you finished pimsleur, try it, see if you can do that) Storytime on the other hand extends every story little by little to the point where you can independently make a unique sentence.

5) this is the most important point. Pimsleur is for BEGINNERS. Like i mentioned previously, you will get more out of the 10 BASIC lessons of storytime than 30 lessons of pimsleur. Pimsluer at the moment only offers 120 lessons in Levels 1-4. Storytime offers 100 lessons on just their Level 1. its ridiculous how much faster you can learn when you READ ALONG! Too bad pimsleur couldn't figure out that concept.
6) Level 1 of pimsleur is $350, times 4, $1400 for levels 1-4. Level 1 of storytime is $250 (i got it cheaper, for $200. I'm sure you can email them and ask for a cheaper rate. My friend did it)

amazon sells individual mp3 lessons of story time, but their website has the full version of the first two lessons for free"
Great product. A very helpful program to have on my computer.
"Excellent tax software program, easy to use, intuitive, and accurate."
"Did my taxes, like it's supposed to"
"I would like to give a more detailed review of this program, but about all I can say is that it's VERY slow with Win7, and 80% of the time it hangs up and won't work at all. Because of this, I've been unable to explore or use most of the features this program has to offer. When it loads and is functioning, I'm able to make adjustments to my photos that I like, but it takes FOREVER to save them. Patience would definitely be a virtue in this case, but unfortunately, mine runs out pretty quickly!

I purchased this program because other Amazon customers stated that it runs well on their Win7 systems, so I think it's important for people to note that, apparently, it doesn't run the same on every machine.

Corel will sell an upgrade for an additional $80, but since I just forked over the money for this version, it's out of my budget."
"I've used this for years now to clean my registry, manage my startup items, and generally troubleshoot my system whenever it seems slow.  It's a must have next to go with whatever security software you're running."
This is a wonderful product I have not stop using it since the day I received it. This is a product that all students should have. I searched pretty much everywhere for this product for different prices and Amazon is the cheapest. Other than the price being so cheap I also like that you are able to use it on three different computers. So I say this is a very good deal with a wonderful PRICE TOO!!!
"Don't buy this product from Delta Electronic seller. It was fake and no matter what I did through Microsoft help/support, the product key did not work."
I wish it did a little more but all in all it works great.  I had to learn how to use the proper voice commands but after that I really like it.
I have a Mac and the program froze after the first few screens.  Missed the eMedia refund window because of a strict 30-day return policy.
Have had nothing but issues with this app. It continues to download music that has already been downloaded.  Fills my device and overloads it. Did not even download each song completely.  Chops off the last half of each song. Every fix I've tried ends in failure. What was wrong with the previous version?
happy about the price compare to the mcafee web site. also like that it was a code instead of a cd rom.
Works great with Windows-10
"Great software. I have been using this for 3 years, free."
"Works Great , Delivered as promised."
"I recently bought this having owned earlier versions.

I have no idea why the one reviewer is having so much trouble because it works flawlessly.

I installed it on a non-high end machine. 2.3 GHz, 256meg memory with the medium model and got great accuracy after minimum training. Correcting errors takes only a couple of seconds.

I suggest getting a better microphone than comes with it. My previous experience with the other versions showed that a premium microphone made a huge difference.

Bottom line: you do NOT need a 3.2 GHz 1 Gig memory machine for this. A lower end machine works just fine."
just great
"I have used TurboTax for six years running now and have not had any issues. I like the guide and how it runs through all the scenarios to figure my refund or payment. If I had to fill out the forms myself, I would end up spending more than I did on the product in wasted time (I do place a value on my time). Save yourself the grief and let TurboTax do the heavy lifting for you."
Great price and great product.  Norton keeps all my machines clean.
It is better than our old version which came installed in a computer we purchased. We have years of invoice information for our water district and changing to a new program was going to be time consuming and problematic. Now that we have the disk for the program when can still use it when a computer finds itself hobbling on its last legs. THANK YOU!
"This thing works a treat. Works very well. Very good signal, router downstairs while PC upstairs. Fast download speed. Very happy....."
Getting too expensive!!! Normally pay $29 for it and this year was forced to buy this version $49. Been using it for the last 10 years but may have to make a change. Wasn't happy!!!
"I had this game before and lost it
Glad to have it again I play constantly
Excellent price"
I've trusted Norton for years.  Easy download!
I am a  long-time customer who are absolutely furious with Intuit for downgrading the capabilities of TurboTax Deluxe so that it can no longer do what it has done for many years. The product instead informs me that I require premier and I must pay another $30.  H R block here I come.
"I have bought the program for the last few years and am always impressed with the knowledge of the program, the updates, the help and all.  It is very relaxing to be able to do taxes at your own leisure and know it has been done right."
"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Works-9-0/dp/B000Q6ZK3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Works 9.0</a>
I bought a new computer with Windows 7. I was a little upset when I discovered it didn't have Microsoft Works in it. I gave Microsoft Office a try and didn't like it. I searched Amazon and found Microsoft Works 9.0 and purchased it. Installed it, transfered my history files from my old computer and I am back in business again. MS Works is great for home use and even a small business. I think MS Office is more for business and more complicated to use. Great price on MS Works also.

"Corel continues to make a fine product.  I first used WordPerfect, Ste 8, version, it has been a very high quality product.  It had just about everything you want to work on any documentation.  Along with advancing technology, I had to upgrade.  I have used Office X3 for the past 4 months, and I give it Five Stars.  It now has a better conversion program, so you can read and generate documentation in Microsoft Word.  There is no document out there I can't read with Office X3 helping me.  Much appreciation to Corel for continuing to make a fine product."
Turbo Tax always come through
"The box and Amazon both said this game was compatible with Vista, but it is not. Neither does it run on my XP machine. Tried to contact Encore but got no response. Rip off, don't buy."
"I bought this product, hoping that it would be a much better version and versatile than its predecessors. Compared to NIS 2006, NIS 2007 isn't intuitive and doesn't have much of customisable features. Ad-blocking and Popup-blockers have been removed from NIS. You can't specify this product to block particular internet sites as opposed to NIS 2006.
I am not that impressed by this product anymore as it does nothing more than slowing down your machine."
Parfait.
I have had nothing but problems since upgrading to windows 10.  It has been one thing after  another.  Right now I cannot install new programs.  Keep getting error 2502 and 2503.  Microsoft support has not been able to help.
We firmly believe that everyone should use PC TOOLS REGISTRY MECHANIC.  We trust its use with our desktops and have never had any problems with use year after year.
"The software/hardware works (yes you must use their USB 2 cable if you are using it).  After reading all of the reviews I decided to use it and consulted with their tech support before installing the program.  You must follow the instructions precisely and in exactly their sequence.  Don't try to use other hardware (other cables) and make sure you use the latest software version (it will prompt you).  It is tedious because you are constantly going back and forth between the 2 machines but after the transfer (2 hours in my case, I only transferred the applications) the programs worked fine.  In my case I went from a 32 bit XP to a 64 bit Vista and was happy with the results.  My only complaint is that the cables have an orientation (source and target).  I had to switch them (it warns you in the manual).  They could easily label or color code the connectors to make it easier.  Otherwise I am very pleased with the performance of the product.  It did exactly what it said it would do."
"This software wants to update right away, then won't work after update.  You have to call support, re-install, then have the auth keys re-set.  Then for goodness sake, never update the darn thing again, or you start all over again.
Your microphone interface will go bad every now and then.  Errors will pop up repeatedly for no reason, forcing you to restart your computer to hopefully make it work- until it doesn't work- then you go through the rigamarole with customer tech support based in India or Pakistan.

This has been my biggest waste of home education dollars.  I pay less money for a game like Guildwars, and it works, ALL THE TIME.  I don't have to fix it or call support.  There is no reason for this type of low quality in a high priced item like Rosetta Stone.

We are switching to Livemocha.  There's no point in paying a lot of money to a company that can't afford to keep its software updated and working well, from the outset."
It's exactly what I expected since I upgraded  from PSE 11. When I had problems getting the download to work on a Saturday morning. I also got great assistance from Amazon in making things work.
"I ran into the same problem with the mmvdpro.swf file at 21 %.  I rebooted the machine into Safe Mode with Networking, installed it and it worked!  Hope this helps."
"This is a good game for children to help them build their confidence in problem solving skills, following directions, recognizing colors and shapes.  The characters are fun and easily recognizable by children. Highly recommended"
I've had no good results with PC Matic.  It is terribly slow and hangs up.  I usually just check out after 20 to 30 minutes of sitting there.  I run XP and maybe that could be the problem but I don't think it is.  Safe your money.
I just renewed my contract as the year was up. I got a better deal with my computer and had a service call where the tech Mike worked on a problem. He worked on it nearly 2 hours and did an outstanding job while send me chat messages of what was going on during the process. Very impressive.
Great quick and easy way to learn Spanish on the fly. Does not concentrate on the reading of a language.
"Commercial use, great price though first shipment was open box."
"I was a Beta Tester on the 2007 as well as the 2008 versions of Turbo Tax. From the very first build of the beta, this years' version was so much better. It ran smoother, the help section was more concise, the ease of the whole program was just better. The whole Intuit team really listens to what the user wants & needs. There are other programs out there, but there is none better than Turbo Tax 2008.

It did not take long for new issues to infect my computer.
"Although it was not obvious at the time, this software corrupted files each year it was installed for the past 3 years.  In 2006 it conflicted with Windows Explorer, Music Match Jukebox and Install Shield.  In 2007  the ability to use email was lost.  Earthlink support was unable to diagnose or to correct the problem via remote assistance.  When the internet service was changed to Road Runner, the internet connection was disrupted. A clean install was necessary to correct the problem.  In 2008 there was a conflict with Roxio and the computer crashed.  Another reinstall was necessary.  In the same year Casale Media installed a piece of spyware that Trend Micro could not eliminated. SuperAntispyware had to be added to get rid of the spyware.  This year Avast Home Edition was installed for free. A msconfig was done to reduce the number of programs at startup.  The computer is running faster.  No lockups as with Trend Micro.  So far so good."
"Not able to download it to my computer. You might get more eviews if you didn't expect so much from the reviewer.  I have tried often but I am not a ""wordy"" person.  I hated the way this product needed to be installed and the tech support was worthless."
Best Antivirus that I have ever used. Beat others by a mile!
"I have a Fujitsu tablet PC and, with Mobile PC running, it performs similarly to my wife's and daughter's Nuvis, with one exception.  When entering a street address, the Garmin keyboard does pop up.  Instead, I have to use the Fujitsu keyboard application which has small letter icons and I need to use a stylus instead of my finger to enter letters and numbers. I Called Garmin about this and they said the keyboard option has been disabled on Mobile PC.  Because of this I've downgrading my 'satisfaction' rating from excellent to good."

"I really want to make a Family cookbook.  I had made a start with Living Cookbook but when I bought a Mac, it was out of the question to continue.  Cook'n easily downloaded the work that I had done and it became the start of my cookbook there.  After accumulating 159 recipes, I noticed that some would not print!  In trying to get them to do so, I clicked on something that threw me out and I was stuck!!!  HELP.  The next day, there was an E from Tech support offering to take over my screen and fix the problem.  Today, in about an hour, the new version of Cook'n was installed and the mystery of why my recipes wouldn't print was solved.  I am now on my way!  I know that I will have a few more questions before the book goes to its final printing but because of today, I am confident that I will have the answers that I need and at last, I'll have all of my family recipes ready for the next generation!
There is a user forum where you can go to get answers to your problems or to read tech support advice given to others.  It is obvious that this company is trying to solve any problems that users encounter and they are responsive to requests for help.
I have tried several cookbooks for Mac and none of them is able to compare to Cook'n.
There are several other reviews on this site that highlight many of the other things that Cook'n does well.  I am so focused on my project that I have not explored them.  I look forward to doing so!
I rated Cook'n 4 out of 5 stars because I can still see improvements to be made.  But, I'll bet that soon, I'll be able to upgrade that to a 5!"

"THIS REVIEW ONLY DISCUSSES USING DRAGON TO INDEX THE 1940 US CENSUS.

I have had Dragon Naturally Speaking since version 9.5.  Although it works well, I don't normally use it because I'm an attorney and I find that when I type my wording is easy to read and understand but when I dictate it comes out as typical legalese.  The times I have tried using Dragon at work I spent more time thinking before dictating or editing the dictated text than if I just typed from scratch.

The only point I want to make in this review is that Dragon on Win 7 DOES work with the indexing software for the 1940 U.S. Census (FamilySearch.org).  The best way to use it is to index the images by columns instead of rows. It is particularly useful for the House Number, Given Name, Relationship and Place of Birth fields.  Say the item, press Down Arrow. Say next item, down arrow, e.g., ""Fred"" down arrow ""Harriet"" down arrow.  It MASSIVELY speeds things up--and you don't have to worry about spelling errors on place names unless a word has two spellings (some cities are Pittsburgh and others are Pittsburg)."
"Pros: Jump start is a great program!

Cons: Hard to figure out where to go. Not easy to play, I even had a hard time with it. My third grade son lost interest within days."
"I'm new to Photoshop and thought this was the perfect training for a beginner. I loved the trainer, but I guess I have a thing for U.K. accents. I love the fact I can now modify my own pictures for Christmas and birthday cards. And, I love the price. I guess I love no sales tax as well. Thanks Amazon!"
I have used Kaspersky for quite sometime.  It has always performed as expected.  There are some changes year-to-year but it seems to work better than most of the competitors for me.
"Been using this software since back in the days when it was known as Tax Cut, I have never encountered any problems with this software. It loads easily onto my old computer and the interview process seems to cover all the bases. That said, I have never tried Turbo Tax and my tax situation is pretty straight forward, no exotic investments, write offs or unusual income sources."
"Just purchased an Imac and needed an office program to run on it , this is perfect ."
This product was a breeze to install and use.  It does take a while for the program to open a pdf but to make a pdf it is quite a breeze.  I would recommend the program to another person easily.
"Iolo doesn't respond to emails. I have sent 3 in past 3 wks and NO RESPONSE. Are they still in business.
They didn't respond earlier this yr either(spring 2012).

Nice software.  Disappointed there isn't a lot of functionality to do with photos.  Seems I need to buy an addon to make it happen.
"The newest version of Zone Alarm Internet Security Suite 2007 is absolute crap.  I only wish I could give it 0 stars.  Trust me...DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!  The version I got is the latest build, and I had nothing but problems from the day I installed.  System (actually I have it loaded on 2 laptops) takes up to 20 minutes to shutdown, and XP user switching, which should take less than a minute can take up to 5 minutes.  And I thought my Norton product slowed things down.

Today, though, was the topper.  I scheduled the virus scan to run every day at 2:00 AM.  On one machine it didn't run, and the ZA control panel said it was in the process of downloading updates.  I waited....and waited; a full half hour, and updates were still being unloaded??? Clearly something was wrong, so I had to shutdown.

On my other computer the system said the virus scan was still running.  Now since I checked my computer at 6 AM, that means it had been running for 4 hours.  Again....????  Worse yet, though it indicated it was running, under files scanned it showed zero.  Again, I shut my system down, since obviously something was very wrong.

I contacted ZA, and their answer re my slow shutdown problem was as follows:

<------- WHEN REPLYING, PLEASE TYPE YOUR TEXT ABOVE THIS LINE -------->

""Hello Frank,

Thank you for your inquiry. This is a known issue. At this time there is nothing else I can recommend other than to revert to 7.0.337.000. Please download this version of the Zone Alarm Security Suite by clicking on the following link:

[...]""

In other words, our new product doesn't work, so just go back and use a prior version.  Talk about bad business!!!!

Needless to say, I won't bother downloading this earlier version. In my mind this suite is total garbage, and now I need to see if my computer acts up post-removal.  I hope not, since I ""think"" I cleaned all remnants using CCleaner.

Finally, I'm contacting Amazon about this problem.  I guess it should have been obvious to me when the price of the new release was less than the older release that there was a problem.

Again, save yourselves money and LOTS of headaches...avoid this product like you would a rabid dog!"
"It does what it says it will do, and mostly intuitive if you're familiar with html at all. The downside is that your host must provide FrontPage Extensions for it to work at all; some hosts will not support FrontPage extensions. Another downside is that FrontPage is a hog of web space usage, maybe double what other html software uses. It all works well, but too wasteful of storage space."
enjoy it on my PC
It does what it's supposed to- it lets you read your books.
"I used Norton Ghost 9 for a couple of years and just recently upgraded to Ghost 10. Both versions have performed flawlessly through numerous backups of my two computers. I've also restored one or the other of those two computers several times with version 9 and once with version 10. In each case, those computers were restored to the same condition at the time of the backup used. In fact, the computers seemed utterly unaware of the restorations, with everything (software, drivers, files, and so on) operating normally afterwards (just like nothing had happened). Windows XP had to be re-validated after each restoration, using the automatic online process like a new installation. Otherwise, Windows also behaved just fine after the restorations.

Ghost obviously cannot perform miracles on a seriously dysfunctional computer, such as one with hardware issues or one so chaotic as to actually corrupt the operations of Ghost itself. However, Ghost does indeed serve well on a normally healthy computer temporary experiencing problems easily resolved by a product like this. Since good computers do occasionally mess up, a good backup solution is an essential tool. Given our success with this product, I now consider Ghost that tool and can highly recommend it to others.

Having said that, it is also worthwhile to say something about the negative reviews here. The only problem with review sites like this is that you often only see two types of people posting - those truly enthusiast about a product and those truly dissatisfied. The vast majorities in the middle, who buy a product, install it, use it, and go on about their lives, rarely take the time to hunt down a review site to comment. Furthermore, it is a little hard to get overly enthusiastic about a software tool like a backup utility, especially after spending an hour or so installing and then backing up a computer with it. So ultimately what you see most often posting here are the relative handful dissatisfied with Ghost, not the many millions installing and using this product without finding anything worth commenting about. After all, that (install, use it, and forget it until needed next time) is exactly how a good, well designed, software utility like this is supposed to work.

In the end, when reading the negative reviews, ask yourself how (if this software is as bad and as flawed as the reviewers claim) all those other people (like myself) are able to install and use it without any problems whatsoever. It's very easy to deny problems with a computer and blame it on something else instead, just as it is easy to install another product to bypass those problems temporarily (not fixed & will likely reappear in the future). Again considering my own long-term success with this product, I have to wonder if that is exactly what some of the others here are doing."

"This was the first Scooby PC Game we bought. It was so much fun for my son we bought the others. This one is directed towards the younger Scooby Fans and is perfect for someone just learning how to solve and play mysteries on computers.

My three children (9, 7, and 5) have played this one repeatedly and have had many hours of fun playing this game.

It has all the ear marks of a typical Scooby Doo type game. There are monsters, scooby treats to collect, small puzzles in range of abilities to play and lots of enjoyment to have when playing this game.

Well worth the money.
Enjoy."
"This product works exactly as advertised.  I had some conflicts with existing Norton products during the initial installation.  The Symantec Help Line was very helpful.  Basically I had to search for, and delete, all Norton and Symantec files.  The Visa rebate debit card initially presented some problems.  Once I located a checker savy enough to understand what they were doing, it finally cashed.  I would certainly have preferred an old fashioned check!"

"I work in a highly integrated setting with Windows/Mac and mostly MS Office generated media. I have both Office and iWork on my computer. Up to the most recent release of iWork, Office has pretty much been my workhorse because there are no document conversion issues and Office still did the job better.

Now with the most recent iWork release, I am using the Apple product for a greater percentage of my work. The conversion from Word, Excel and Powerpoint is about 90% accurate. Pages still has the most formatting foibles - mostly misplaced tabs and indents leading to unsightly spacing. Keynote does a fine job of importing Powerpoint with few formatting problems. Numbers does a great conversion of Excel files though my spreadsheet needs are limited.

As far as generating new documents, iWork has finally surpassed Office and is less bloated for features I never use. The automatic appearing, context sensitive format bars are very friendly, very Apple. I t has really matured as a stand alone product and I would convert to iWork exclusively if not for my need to seamlessly convert to Office documents. Very happy with this release and would recommend it to users who do not need to work in mixed environments."
"I just finished the puzzle, and the exploration inside Notre Dame.  My biggest suggestion is to SAVE often!  It may have just been my Win95 computer but on two different occaisions, I lost all my work when the program caused an error and had to shut itself down.  I would also suggest that you do the master level before going inside the cathedral with the key.  If not, any of the puzzles you solve will not be solved on the next level.  To save yourself the heartache of having to redo everything, wait until you are a master builder.  Other than that, have fun!  :)"
"Hype is one of the most startling games that I have ever had the honor to come across - I found myself pleasantly surprised by it.  I must admit, I wasn't really too sure about this game at first, I mean it's a game made by Playmobil - a company that makes those lego-resembling toys for young children.  What kind of game could you possibly expect coming from this children's company?

I have nothing against Playmobil, just for record, I find the Playmobil toys to be some of the most impressive children toys out there.  The attention they pay to detail in the toys is just amazing, and you can see the reflection of this detail in Playmobil's Hype: The Time Quest.  The graphics are not perfect, I'm not saying that at all.  But I love that they don't lazily throw something together.  Take, for example, the time when Hype is to get into a battle in front of a whole arena of people.  Typically in games I find that the creators of the game do not give the audience faces, all of the people are the same just duplicated. But in Hype you'll find that the audience all look different, I'm sure that any Playmobil fan would have a fun time trying to recognize the faces of the Playmobil characters you see in the audience.

This leads me to another aspect of the game that is impressive - the characters.  The characters are so loveable, so funny, so unique.  I can recall even the very minor characters in my memory because they were just so unique.  Usually in video games I do not even bother to talk to the town people because they usually say the same thing; which is usually telling you what you have to do next - but this is not the case in Hype.  Some characters will scream at your presence, some will welcome you, some are complete lunatics that just make you laugh.

The only flaw character-wise that I see is that the character that you play as, Hype, never talks.  You never really get to know his personality because he never says a single word and doesn't really act out anything in the short movie clips that there are in the movie.  Some people would view this as a good thing because it shows that YOU are Hype, and Hype's personality is YOUR personality.  I find this to be annoying, though, I want to know who Hype is.  Hype could never be my favorite character in this game because we don't really know who he is.

Some games have such impressive storylines that the only way to show these storylines is to have a bunch of those movie clips, and very long movie clips.  Hype, however, has a pretty unique, interesting storyline yet does not put in all those tedious, long movie clips. Basically, the storyline in Hype is that the evil Black Knight rained in on their parade, Hype tried to protect the king but ended up getting sent back in time where the game starts and you have to find a way to get Hype through all of these obstacles to eventually bring him back to his present time and defeat the Black Knight. (a very basic description of the really quite impressive storyline)  To introduce this storyline there is a beginning video, but it is not long and tedious.  None of the movie clips in the game are.  You will find yourself run into a good amount of these movie clips but you will never find yourself thinking, ""Gosh! Is this movie over yet?! I want to play!""  The game has a very good balance between movie time and gameplay.

I love the movies, they can be quite humorous at times and are just really full of lively fun.

There is a good balance in the audio levels.  The music does not over-power the character's voices or the game's sound effects.  Yet, it is not so quiet that you can't hear it.  Bringing me to another stunning quality - the music.  I absolutely loved this music.  It matched the story so well and really brought you into Hype's world, it made you feel the emotions that Hype and the other characters were feeling.  I would love just to get this music on a CD, it's so tranquil at times, so joyful at others, it's just really impressive.

The age level for this game, at first glance, looks as though it is more suited for the younger audience.  When I first saw this game I had instantly assumed it was for the ages 5-10 or something of that sort.  For that reason I wasn't even sure whether or not I would like the game.  However, a good friend of mine talked so highly of it that I was persuaded to at least give it a try (and many thanks to my friend for telling me about the game).  You'll find that the game is not really for the younger audience, though.  Sure, the graphics and lack of anything gory makes it seem like a game best suited for the younger audience; but I quickly found that the game has a more broad age range.

The language used is what really got me thinking about it.  It doesn't use innappropriate language, no not at all, but it uses a language that younger children would not understand.  I am a highschool student and there were even a few words that I didn't really know exactly what they meant.  I'm not saying that the game is hard to understand, if you're playing the game you don't really need to understand it all, I'm just saying that it seems like the creators made the game for a broad age range.

Children will enjoy the game because of it's adventures, the charming characters you encounter, and the challenging - but not OVERLY challenging gameplay.

Teens will enjoy it because of the challenge and the puzzles, the character interaction, the music, and the gameplay itself.

Adults will enjoy the game for the same reasons and approve it for younger children because of the lack of gore in the game.

Overall, it's a very nice game.  I thoroughly enjoyed myself while playing and plan on playing it through many more times to come.  If you are a fan of action-adventure games then I highly recommend this game to you.  It's a real refreshing breath of air compared to the more common, gory video games that you see today."
I am not impressed with McAfee help.  My Fire Wall won't go on and my first attempt to get help by phone resulted in only someone trying to sell me a PC cleaner and I couldn't get any response from their website.  Result no Fire Wall for weeks.  Will certainly not be renewing my subscription.
Will not load on newer computers.  I had an old unusable CD already; I wanted a newer version for my Windows 7 computer.  It's a great learning CD but doesn't work.  I'd love to have an updated version.
I have been using this software for years and it is similar to previous years.  Easy to use and good customer service.  I have not found any issues with it
Too complicated.

"If you are serious or even semi serious about your collection then do yourself a favor and invest into this product. I just recieved mine yesterday and I was amazed at what can be done with this product. The fact that it is very user friendly is a great bonus. Trust me, you will not be let down."
"I have been using Norton for as long as I can remember.  As far as protection goes, I've never had a virus, worm or other disease on my computer.  That's something I just don't worry about with Norton Internet Security.

I use the Vault and found this to be one of my most used features of Norton software.  And it worked great until version 2014. It has caused nothing but problems for me on my computer.  It doesn't work with FIrefox at all.  It crashes often on Chrome.

I'm not sure why they had to change it, but it was not an improvement.  They really need to revert to the way it worked in 2013 or make some significant improvements."

Very easy to use!  Anyone can do it!  This software also helps you with the lasted tax laws and current available write-offs.
"I've used both TurboTax and TaxCut in the past nine years, and I have to say, I keep coming back to TaxCut. It is quick, easy, and the deduction pro softward included makes me feel that I'm getting all the deducations I can.

works fine and is as promised and advertised
"The only thing that I do NOT like about Quicken products is the FORCED renewal of their products. If you do not buy the updated version, your old version stops working correctly."
"I got HR block because of the Turbo Tax issue.

I am disappointed with HR Block for 2 reasons

1)An extra state tax return was very very expensive. It cost me with tax $41 for New York.  I don't remember it being this much when I used Turbo tax.

2) HR Block double my NJ reported income.  There is no reason for it to do this.  I had to override the this line."
"Human Japanese is a truly superb introduction to what from the outside seems a daunting task---learning an Asian language.  Instruction in grammar and usage in this CD language program is congenial and clear.  Words, phrases, and sentences are in clickable format with instant, clear, and repeatable hearing of essential Japanese vocabulary.  Cultural notes add to the over-all excellence of the program.  With a reasonable price and rapid and courteous customer support, Human Japanese instructs and satisfies."
"I've had many versions of Paperport and the last was 10 on Windows XP.  It was a great document organizer and good for converting documents to .pdf  My problem with 10 was it couldn't handle more than one direction at a time.  If I had to email more than one time in one session, the app would hang.  I'd have to shut down and restart.  Therefore, after every email, if I needed to use the program, I'd have to exit and restart Paperport.  Very, very annoying and a big waste of my precious time.

Well, since I just built my new business PC due to a crash, I stupidly installed Vista Ultimate.  I tried so hard to wait til Windows 7 but I took the plunge to Vista.  Then installed MS Office 2007 Enterprise edition.  It worked.  Then I found out Paperport 10 didn't and I was forced to upgrade to 11.1  After that, Word 2007 croaked very often, giving me a message, ""MS Word has stopped working"".  Since I build PCs myself, this is the first time I ever encountered a problem with Word 2007.  No other app would crash except Word 2007. I'd have to do a repair.  It could work once and then crash again.  I started doing inquiries and research.  I have a tech friend whose setup is the same as mine,EXCEPT he doesn't have Paperport installed and his Office works fine.

After frustrating days of Word crapping out and that darn message, I was about to reformat and start over but my patience was too thin to think about doing that.  I ventured into the MS forums and lo and behold, there were many with the same ""Word has stopped working"" message but only one person had mentioned Paperport 11 and bingo, he hit the nail on the head!  I had installed Paperport Pro 11 with PDFCreate, the same software he had installed too.

If you have the same problem as me, the answer is to go into the registry and delete the references to PDFCREATE by Zeon
REMEMBER TO BACK UP THE REGISTRY BEFORE DOING ANY CHANGES!!!!! Export it to your desktop just in case things get messed up.

There are COM add-ins that messed up Word 1007.
Here's the resolution though:

Go to Start, Run, type in regedit.
Then go to:

1) HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Word\Addins (In my registry, the add-ins are NOT in the ""Office\12.0\Word"" subkey, but in the ""Office\Word"" subkey - Microsoft please take note)

2) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\Word\Addins

In all situations, I removed the add-in key that had ""Zeon"" in the name. I left any keys with ""PaperPort"" in the name alone.

In addition, there were 2 more changes in the registry I made, not related to Paperport, but in any event they corrected the corruption of Word:

Here's the fix:
The fix was to rename two files, through the following path: Start button/All programs/Accessories/Run and type in 'regedit' and then follow the path HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Office/12.0/Word . . . .  and then change the folder called 'data' to 'olddata' and change the folder called 'options' to 'oldoptions'.

Well, that's it. Word 2007 works great now and Paperport 11 works with my new cheap Canon LiDE200 scanner.  In fact, I find that my scans are much quicker and Paperport 11 is much faster than 10."
"Having used several previous versions of PSE, (Version 7, 9 and 11), on both PC and MAC, I am very comfortable giving this version a 5 star rating.
First, I've noticed that it loads more quickly than previous versions. This is a strong positive asset for me.
Next, I appreciate many of the interface improvements. Naturally, you will need a ""break-it-in"" period in order to build your comfort with the changes and re-locations of various features (MANY changes from older versions in terms of tool, layout and function locations). Overall, I think the icons and layout designs are clean, simple and functional. The changes may even seem to make this version look ""lighter"" or ""watered down"" but be reassured that the expected power and functionality is still there. I haven't even mentioned any improvements or add-ons.
Lastly, I think the stability and overall performance are quite strong. I've opened PSD project files that I created in previous versions and they work seamlessly.
If you are comfortable with previous versions of PSE, with a little patience you will love this one too."

"You want an honest review? Save your money.

I switched to Money 2004 Deluxe and was so happy to get away from Intuit (Quicken). I laughed for a full year as I enjoyed Money 2004 Deluxe immensely.

Then I ""Upgraded"" to 2005 Deluxe in January. What a mistake.

As other reviewers have mentioned, it is full of bugs and removes features that were in the previous version.

I repeatedly requested a way to set up multiple home page views, as I did in Money 2004. The car page, the home page, etc. I was stonewalled and finally they simply refused to answer me straight out when I wanted a simple answer ""is the feature no longer present?""

Then I sent an email to support regarding 3 bugs I've been putting up with for 2 months.

1) Automatic Sign-in to Hotmail no longer works after running Money 2005. Until you reboot the computer.

2) Accouts do not automatically update anymore, you must manually force the update.

3) The ""Hide this window"" for the updating message box doesn't work. The software never remembers you want the window to stay hidden, so you must constantly close it every time you update.

The answer from support? (paraphrased) ""We can reproduce all 3 of these issues and they've been reported to the developers. Unfortunately we cannot guarantee these features will be added to Money 2005. Send them a suggestion.""

These aren't features, they are BUGS. They should have been fixed IMMEDIATELY. After 2 months they still aren't doing anything about them?

Latest issue: I closed a CD account with my bank. Every time I manually update, I get errors because the account no longer exists at the bank. Is there a way to stop this CLOSED account from updating? Of course not. Tech support told me to reopen the CD account and disable online services. This disables ALL online services for my bank as you can only do it by institution, not by account. I followed his instructions, realizing I would have to re-enable my other bank accounts for online updates. When I did this, Money 2005 was so kind as to connect to my bank and make ALL NEW ACCOUNTS, leaving me with duplicate accounts for every bank account I had been using.

First, closed accounts should not be ""updated"". Duh. Second, the software should allow EACH account to be disabled from online updates, not just on an institutional basis.

Do the developers actually use their own software? I think not.

Whomever is responsible for this pile of garbage should be fired by Microsoft. Maybe they can get a job at Intuit, that's where they belong. Bring back the development crew for Money 2004. Please."
Delivered quickly. Tried installing it with activation key but it didn't work. Requires activation. Will call company tomorrow.
easy to get the biggest refund (if you overpaid).

"My third or fourth year with this product and I have never had any issues. Works like it says and the price I can usually find cheapest on Amazon!
I have no interest in any other product.

UPDATE: Like any antivirus software product, this cannot stop everything out there and it did not. I got infected with a really bad virus that was holding my personal files for ransom. All my files, music, and photos were encrypted and the sysem was unstable. If I paid there was no gaurantee the monster would give me the code to uncrypt my files. I was also in formed that if I paid this person would have been able to gain access to my account and would have taken whatever was in there. The laugh was on him there! {or her} I brought the laptop to the Geek Squad who found another 217 viruses on my laptop that got by this antivirus software. Now I am questioning if it is as good as I have always believed it to be.
I also switched my laptop to run Linux and got rid of windows. Hopefully this will add to a natural barrier against these pesky viruses."
"If you are a pastor or live in the state of Vermont, don't buy this program. They won't let you e-file if you have a housing allowance which most all pastors do. If you file in Vermont, they only do the simple form IN111 and not the complicated ones we need to do like form HI-144 or HS-122. Then what you have to do to save it to a PDF is awful. Never had any of these problems with Turbotax"
"This seems to be a much better product than norton antivirus, which I used to use.  Norton slowed my system down to a crawl.  This is barely noticeable.  Shipped faster than I expected too."
"The thing about an Apple Mac, is that they just work.  I don't have to fight running out of memory, the computer locking up or the dreaded BSOD (Blue Screen Of Death).

Now, with Parallels, I can have my Mac and run that 1 program that is only available for PCs.  Life is good!  I even run the Parallels in the mode that makes it look like a Mac application.  I don't have to be reminded about that famous ""Windows"" environment.

Thank you Parallels!"
"This is a very versatile piece of notation software. I love that I can add effects, add drums, and a huge number of other things. The ability to save and/or print your notation in a variety of formats and in a variety of notation styles is very helpful when playing with a band or other musicians. I also like that I can import different types of files and have them automatically transcribed. In all, it is much better and feature rich than the previous version and a great value for any guitarist, bassist, or any musician who wants to be able to write music for guitar, bass, or any other instrument. Very highly recommended!"
"Crashed when trying to import wav files for short film soundtrack. Rebooted and used audiograbber to convert wav to mp3. Program crashed again when trying to import the mp3.  Also crashed when trying to use anything from windowsmedia. Turned a fun movie project into a frustrating experience that chewed a lot of time without reaching satisfactory conclusion.

Movie could be broken up by frame and separated by titles. You can even tint and choose different fonts. Really bites to get through all the frame editing work only to find that a soundtrack can't be added.

Broderbund's rep has taken a big step down with me."
"This product is everything it purports itself to be, and much, MUCH, more.  You're not buying just software, but tons of support.  It's got a slightly steep learning curve, but so much included instruction in the form of MP4 video tutorials, that you'll be up and running in no time.

If you are an author who's thinking of self-publishing, don't waste your money on conversion services.  Don't lose control of how your digital book will be received by your readers.  Get this product and see for yourself what the published product will look like.  Edit your novel and clean it up easily within the program.

The software's author is an inspiration, not just to software authors, but to any author who buys it."

"Here's my bottom line on this:

(1) It's not a ""Pro"" version, this is clearly for beginners. That's not an insult on anybody - I would definitely suggest this over a ""dummies guide"" for business forms. But if you've been doing business for any amount of time, you've done all this before.

(2) As always with these products, it's a hassle digging through hundreds of pages of junk to find what you need.

Ok, that said, here are some more details. First, I'm shocked amazed and confused why they don't tell you what you get in this box set! Here is what's included:

* Six E-Books
-Legal Guide for Starting & Running Small Business
-Deduction Manager
-The Manager's Legal Handbook
-How to Write a Business Plan
-Contracts
-Essential Guide to Federal Employment Laws

* 1 Pocket Book
-Your Little Legal Companion

* A ton of forms. Categories are:
-Business Minutes
-Collection Letters
-Demand Letters
-Bill of Sale
-Contract for Manufacturing Goods
-Partnership Agreement
-Corporate Bylaws
-LLC Operating Agreement
-Independent Contractor Agreement
-Limited Power of Attorney for Finances
-Leases
-Email policy
-Letter to Landlord
-Confidentiality Letter

Ok, this might be a convenient library for some, but pretty much all of these are free in the public domain. For example, the Deduction Manager e-Book is basically a reprint of the IRS publication on the subject. A lot of people don't know that most government publications are not copyrighted (they are public domain) so you can reprint it and claim authorship. Some of these sections appear reprinted word-for-word from the tax forms you get from the library.

The forms can easily be found free online, and they are mostly beginner forms (nothing ""Pro"" here). The little book included here is not helpful at all. It includes advice like:

-> ""Opposites make great friends, but not necessarily great roommates""

and

-> ""Never buy a dog from a pet store""

Huh? How exactly does that help me with my mid-sized business operations? If you need advice like that, by the way, I love the Bottom Line books (much more dense, and much cheaper - get them for 1 on Amazon).

And I think the ""2014"" is just a bit of marketing - almost none of the advice or forms here have changed in 100 years.

I think this is probably better than a Dummies Guide, so if you're in the market for something like that, go for it! But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else."
"When disc is inserted into laptop, it doesn't boot up and give you any prompts or commands........ergo I'm not sure how to utilize it.......I'll need to play around with it when I have more time."
An easy to use program.  Makes reports go faster!
"Its easy to install & easy to set up, and so far does what its suppost to do, keep my kid safe."
"I had a lot of VHS tapes I didn't want to lose and was not about to pay someone $30 an hour to convert them to disc.

This is as easy as hit play on VCR and record on the Honestech software. There's also tons of editing tools and special effects if you want them.

There's also a bonus I didn't expect, Audio recorder which let you convert cassettes, LP' and any other type to mp3 and or dic.

Very cool product."
"Works just great on my VISTA operating system, but it has significantly slowed up my laptop with XP."
"This disk savaged my computer because it has the Recovery Console on it and I had no installation disk.  But, beware, there is NO HELP.  I emailed these people and they never answered.  Also, the instructions are, I think, fairly scary.  And, if you get into trouble, no help.  I didn't use their instructions; I used a Microsoft technical guide.  If you are in contact with Microsoft or other technical communities, I'm sure you can make this disk work, and the price is right for sure."
It came and was installed.  No problems except wrong version.
"I was a long time Microsoft Money user - all I wanted to do was to download my credit card transactions and put them into categories so I could track my budget. Now that Money is gone, I had to move to Quicken. It is hard to believe that something as simple as expense tracking could be so messed up, but Quicken found a way. The conversion of my Money data was filled with bugs and its expense reports are difficult to use, and do not export cleanly to excel.

I hate Quicken but there is no other choice now that Microsoft Money no longer has online support."
I would recommend!
"This game, true to the reviews, is a lot of fun.  I am not a big ""gamer,"" and I own a Macbook, so it's difficult anyway to find games in my platform, since it seems most games are made for Windows.  I love strategy games, and I love chocolate, so this was a great choice!

It has a somewhat ""Carmen Sandiego"" feel I remember from elementary school, in the sense you get to travel around the globe finding characters and delivering their orders.  It doesn't require a lot of strategy or smarts, but it still is fun to play.

However, when I attempted to make a raspberry chocolate concoction, the game closed out and I got a reported error.  In the recipe book, it shows you the different ingredients you need, and the picture of the dish was invisible, so it may not have loaded properly.  I'm not sure if there is a glitch in my particular disk, so I will delete the current copy on my computer and start over.  You can still play up until that point (and you get very far), but you cannot win without making and selling that particular product.

On the upside, however, there is a freeplay mode, so even if I can't ""win"" the game, I can still play.  Great game overall."
Works well.  I have used Trend for several years
"Very dissappointed with the 2002 version.  I have used S&T 2000 for several years and loved it.  It was accurate and provided off-line information about the points of interest (great on the road when internet is not available).  This version assumes your always connected. The information button provides only address and phone #, no web address ... just a ""more online"" button.  When I've clicked ""more online"" I've only received ""Page not available"" page.  This version provides NO information about National Parks, Recreation Areas, etc. The 2000 version provided detailed descriptions, kid picks, web addresses, and a ton of other info. (without being on-line).  I have also found numerous errors concerning the location of resturants and other ""points of interest"".
I plan to re-install the 2000 version, return this version (if I can get my money back) and purchase different trip planning software."
"WATCH OUT!  Our household of students and academics upgraded our computers to the latest version of Microsoft Office, only to find that our previously operating version of PERRLA did not work at all with Office 2016, including Word.

PERRLA customer service can only be communicated with by e-mail (no assistance is available if you want to speak with a live person over the phone), and the only response to our inquiry about our problem was that we could give them more money ($35.00) for a downloaded PERRLA version that would work with Office 2016.

Since we had been relying heavily on PERRLA for inserting APA citations and references in graduate research papers, we had no choice but to submit to this extortion, but once we payed our money and downloaded the new version of PERRLA, we found there was no improvement.

PERRLA customer service never responded to our request to remedy the problem, nor to our e-mail request for a refund for an upgrade that they misled us into believing would work. It is very convenient in this case for PERRLA customer service not to have a live human being one can speak to for resolutions involving refund of money. Anyone who purchases PERRLA can and should expect the same kind of problems and outcome."
"A very good Bible study tool and has some useful reference books included. The Bible search is simple and straightforward, and you really can't beat the price. It would've been nice to have some of the more-common modern translations of the Bible included (such as New International Version or English Standard Version), but maybe those are included on the more-expensive versions of the software. Still, I have no complaints. I was a little surprised that the larger box contained only cardboard (to help keep it's shape and protect the contents) and just a DVD in a jewel case. There was no documentation included, so it could've been packaged smaller, but that's just an observation. Instructions for using the software are included in the software or online."
"Well, I have Microsoft Edge and this will not load on it.  I could not get it to load on either of my Samsung tablets either.  I had purchased e-textbooks and now I can only read them on my phone."
I have used quicken for many years and it has always worked well for my needs. I updated the 2014 quicken with the 2016 and had some problems  gaining access with my banking which had been OK before with  the 2014 issue. I finally was able to use the more simplified update system even it takes more steps. I will still haven't been able to find the right system for getting my stocks put in the proper way as well as to automatically up-date them as I do with my banking. I will still work at it unless I get too frustrated. I will continue to use quicken as long as it will do what my needs are and the program remains usable; please keep it simple !
"I purchased directly from Webroot.  I know better but I fell for the PC Mag review (their reviews have become notoriously unreliable).  There are lots of reasons I have uninstalled it and gotten a refund (to Webroot's credit).  I will share a few:

1)  I read the T&C carefully and thoroughly.  They share your personal info, browsing history, etc. with third-parties (undisclosed names), and also obtain personal information from third parties that they combine with that they have already.  How does this protect me?  They won't say.  They just said this:  Our legal team provided the following: ""Webroot requires certain permissions from your devices and collects information about you to provide you with our security services and to let you know about related Webroot security products you might be interested in.""  They can track literally everything you do, every program or app you run (and when), every document you edit, every email, and store that information in their servers.  Isn't that what spyware does.

2) WebRoot hasn't been included in independent testing for a number of years (I can't remember, but about 5).  When I asked why not, this was their response:  ""As far as our participation in AV-Comparatives or AV-Test.org, we have participated in the past. The status of our current participation will likely depend on how cloud security solution providers are tested vs. traditional security solutions. Since the approach to protecting from malware is different, the testing would need to be different to capture real world scenarios effectively. ""  There are a few other cloud-based offerings out there.  It's been years, so I would think that if there was a real will to do so, there would be a testing regimen.  Seems the easiest is to test actual infections and see what gets caught.  That's what the others do.  Isn't that the point of installing this anyway?

3) Webroot discovered one infected file when I installed it and did the initial scan.  IT was one I had written and compiled myself (an EXE)!  It couldn't possibly be infected.  It didn't flag a nearly identical file in the same directory.  Then I executed that (second) file and Webroot flagged it.  Again, that was one I had written and compiled myself.  Two other AV-AM programs ignored it.

4) Webroot brags that it can scan your system in 20 seconds, for which other security software takes about 10 minutes (depending on your CPU speed, size of hard disk, etc.) to do.  Whatever they did in those 20 seconds was nonsense.  My files weren't and aren't infected.  I have since rolled-back my PC's to pre-Webroot and installed other security software that I am confident works (It's not Kaspersky or BitDefender- both highly rated but, to me, equally as security-compromised as Webroot because of their home-nations).

5) I asked support what happens when I uninstall Webroot:  ""Yes, it should remove all traces of the product. If you want to be sure it is completely removed, you can run through the instructions for using the uninstall command below to be sure. ""  (Fortunately I image my PCs every night with Macrium), so I just rolled back to before I installed Webroot obviating the need to uninstall it.  However I did try to uninstall it from one machine before I did that.  It seems to have silently reinstalled itself, because it showed up in Windows Control Panel ""Programs and Features"" again, and had an icon in the system tray again.  Creepy.

6) My conclusion is that Webroot is no better than spyware.  Except that most spyware is free.  I am just glad that Webroot doesn't have my (current) passwords.

My advice is to avoid Webroot.  And avoid taking PC Mag reviews seriously."
Great software and price.
"Had to by this so I could continue to download my bank accounts.  I can download, but it will not reconcile to the banks balance without a workaround.  Not happy.  Support was not much help.  Spent an hour chatting and still have problems.  NOT HAPPY!"
Was never able to use it on my machine. turned out I have the wrong regional version. As if that was ever a thing
Good update to classic.  Its a shame it will not sync to on line accounts without buying new version every few years
"Affordable, easy to install, great product."
I've trusted Norton for many years and never doubt the products.
"having problems with pc downloads  could not complete full download.  purchased an anti virus [ McAfee].  they don't seem to accept it.  l can't even download this paid program.  sick of  it.  feel like pulling the plug on the whole works.  heard good reviews on your free anti virus, not your fault .  thanks.

It is a good player
"I have used Microsoft Money for the past 15 years..  I recently purchased a new laptop and needed a new version of MM, but they have discontinued it.. I tried Checksoft and it is a comparable product to MM, but there is to many annoying things you have to do to enter or change a transaction.  MM, you just entered your transaction.  Checksoft, you have to click ""new"", and either tab or use your mouse to get to the fields you need.  MM, was just straight forward, Check #, date, to who, amount/either transaction or deposit, if want to put something in the memo, enter...  To edit in MM same thing, just go in and edit.  You don't have to hit a ""edit"" button, just edit..

Checksoft is a nice program, it keeps my checkbook balanced, but I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it..."
Excellent product I use it since many years without problem. A good protection against computer virus.
All's well
"I got this bundled when I bought a DVD burner. Running a Norton diagnostic after installation revealed a missing file. I had no problems burning a DVD data disc. When I tried burning a CD I couldn't figure out how to use XP's built in burner, Roxio took over. But the CD burned, would not play back. I ended up using Roxio for DVD burning and when I accumulated enough CDs that needed to be burned I uninstalled Roxio to burn them with XP, then I reinstall Roxio when I need to burn DVDs again."
super effective!
I have Manga Studio 5 and Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator and Sketchbook Pro is so much easier to get to drawing which is what I want to do on my Surface Pro.  I definitely recommend this product for anyone looking to draw digitally.
This software is too confusing.  Wished I could have continue with Microsoft Money.  That software was much more user friendly.  This one is not.
"I was very disipointed in Internet Security 2005.  Besides taking up tons of hard drive space, it uses the majority of your ram.  You cannot run more than two programs at once because it has no ram to run on.  It also caused my advance businuess computer to overload often.  Good protection, bad software."
I use TurboTax every year to do my taxes - I could do (and have done) my taxes by hand but my time is worth too much to me to do that every year.  Turbo tax is easy to use and I love how it saves my information from year to year.
"Every other antivirus program I've ever used slowed my computer down to where it was very frustrating to use. Not this one - my computer boots up faster, programs open faster, web pages load more quickly. It's actually a pleasure to use my computer again!"
I thought there would be more phrases and depth of the French language.
Easy to use on my laptop.
"The creator of the software will be prosecuted and punished under Federal guidelines.

The statutes for felony and organized criminal activity by hate organizations will be applied."

Thank you"
"System Mechanic did not perform as well as it was advertised. Moreover, there is a desire on the part of the company to sell ""premium services"" at costs up to $500 to improve on it's performance.  Case In point, Dell installed a new drive and operating system in my computer, I reinstalled System Mechanic Pro at the same time.  Shortly thereafter I received two calls from a NY exchange telling me my computer has spyware and Trojans that will cause it to crash.  The folks making the call stated they are System Mechanic and I needed to buy additional services and software to prevent these problems from crashing my computer.  When i inquired as to why System Mechanic Pro failed to prevent these problems (a sales point they hold out about their product) no answer followed.  Instead they kept up their pitch to buy premium services and additional software.  Complaints have been filed with the BBB of LA and Dell.

Mean while I caution all buyers to do extensive research into the representations made by System Mechanic before you buy this product."
"Norton is my go-to security system.  I've been using them for many years and I feel very comfortable leaving my PC protection in their hands,  This was the best price I could find on this product.  I previously preferred to buy locally, but with Amazon Prime I found a much better way of shopping!"
"I have a dell laptop with an i7 processor running Windows 7 that is only 3 years old. The software installed just fine, but gave a Windows error as soon as you tried to run it.  After spending about a month with tech support the only answer they could come up with was that it must be my graphics card causing the problem. They think that it is too old to run their product and I should return it for a refund.

Dell XPS
Processor: i7-2630

"I just bought this addition of quick books for my windows 8.  As far as I can tell it sucks.  I'm trying to write payroll for the week and I cannot get it registered.  For being the large company that they are there products seem to suck.  QuickBooks couldn't even come up with a way to make QuickBooks 2012 work with Windows 8.  Somebody else that cares about their customers and service needs to step in and knock these guys off the top, so they realize they need to change their practices!"
"misleading ... says ""State Taxes"" ... additional costs $45 for software ... apart from efile costs.
turbotax has been on path to rip of customers at every step.

after all the pain, the W2 import doesn't work.

may be next year, will move on from turbo tax."
ok
"So far so good.  I switched to Eset because of all the irritating reminder messages I used to get from my two previous ""high end"" antivirus softwares.  I found Eset easy to install and haven't had a single problem with it to date.  Of course, I took extra care to make sure any previous antivirus software was removed first.  I'm curious to see what happens when it's time to renew, but I'm being optimistic.  I would recommend this software, but one should keep in mind I've only been using it for a few months.

Wow! A year has passed and sure enough, my Eset is sending irritating messages to me daily to make sure I remember to buy more, buy more.  I like to feel like I'm not being led around on a leash when I need to update my software, but I will say that ESET is not as irritating as the other two top contenders.  Other than the daily messages to renew, I will say the software has done an excellent job for me.  It's such a shame this software company can't give you an option to check a box to avoid reminder messages.  It feels like an invasion from the very company you expect protection from when you don't want pop-ups.  Will I eventually renew this product?  Yes."
"Very unpolished and has an awful UI. Not worth money.

It's honestly one of the worst pieces of software I have ever experienced. You can't maximize the interface, the size the window opens is what you get. There is now way to zoom. There is no way to change settings until you're in an exercise. In terms of website design, it's a 90s Justin Timberlake fan site. It doesn't have things that you'd expect from even a free piece of software."
"One of the best gift choices I've ever made.
I bought this item for my boyfriend - since his was stolen from
his vehicle - and I was really worried about making the right
choice from all of the others being offered. After checking out
all of the features offered with the other Tom Tom's, I decided
that this one had the best and the most important ones.
My boyfriend was, and still is very impressed with it. It does
everything that it should, plus the map upgrades have been easy
to access and download.

Thanks for a great product.

P.S.

Even though I didn't place my order until a few days before Xmas,
it still arrived only a day or two after. So, great delivery too."
Works well most of the time.
"Microsoft Office Accounting Professional 2008 is Microsoft's answer to Quickbooks and Peachtree, two companies that have led in the accounting software sector for a number of years.  Having used Quickbooks in the past (and still do), I looked forward to the opportunity to test Microsoft's software.

As my intent was to only test this software, I installed the software onto a spare computer so that I did not have to worry that this software would somehow screw up my Quickbooks files.  As this software was able to import my data from Quickbooks, I copied it over and imported it into OAP08 -- relatively painless.  For the next couple weeks, I entered data into both Quickbooks and OAP08 (tedious, but had to be done!)

If you've familiar with MS Outlook, and other Office applications, the interface will seem familiar, which I'd consider a plus.  Integration with other Office applications is also a nice feature.  OAP08 seems geared towards the avid eBay seller with its convenient Paypal integration (costs $$ for monthly subscription -- figures!).  However, these nifty features does not make up for the fact that OAP08 is SLOW.  Admittedly, this spare computer is a bit older...

While MOAP08 does the basics well, like many of Microsoft's other products, its not quite there yet.  It may need a few service packs and updates before it performs as well as it should.  That said, Microsoft has a solid performer that I may very well look into again when my Quickbook updates expire."
"My laptop had been getting sluggish and I was concerned because the Local Disk Drive D was warning me in red that it was nearly full. I was hoping this would solve the problem but it didn't do anything for that drive; I had to go in manually and delete backups.
I also found that I had to change lots of settings on the software because when I opened my home pages, none were logged in because all of my passwords were deleted when the computer was shut down.
I am really not sure of the usefulness of this product but I'm guessing it would be more helpful to a more computer literate individual"
"Just learning , so another review will follow."
The  expressscribe software was just what I needed to allow me to transcribe material. Couldn't have completed my transcription work without it. Great software.
"I've used TurboTax for years and given their price hike and mess up this year decided to give HR Block at try.  Short answer: It's ok, but not as polished and has a few infuriating features that will send me back to TurboTax next year.

* No ""bookmark"".  You can mark an entry as ""tentative"" but TT lets you add a bookmark with notes to yourself about items where you need more info or need to come back.
* Estimated tax calculation is terrible.  For the Federal, it forces me to make changes to my W4 withholding rather than let me manage the amount through estimates.  For state it just dumps me into the State worksheet.  TT is much more refined.
* In a number of places HRB just dumped me into worksheets where they didn't have interviews or for some reason couldn't pull info from elsewhere in the return.
* HRB doesn't have a decent way to tell you which interview topics have been completed or not.
* If you donate stock, the interview doesn't have an appropriate choice for the valuation method.  Forcing me to do some research and hope it will get filled in correctly.
* Virtually no reporting.  A very week comparison to prior years which I use to sanity check and look for discrepancies or things I might have missed.

The bottom line is that I am feeling much LESS confident that I've got it right."
"A very robust product. My computer crashed, this is one of programs, I reinstall"
works well!
"I am obsessed with Quicken... have been using faithfully every single day since 1997. I download new versions every single year even though I know there won't be enough new functionality to make it worth it.  This year is the worst.  NOTHING is new.  Literally.  The only new feature is around the mobile app and frankly, I see it as a sad version of what they have with Mint.  This is the first upgrade I have paid for where I desperately want my money back."
"I'm fairly tech-savvy, but I've never spent the time and energy to really learn any serious graphics editing software.  I'm a business guy, and I spend most of my time in spreadsheets, slide decks, and documents.  I started out on the PC and migrated over to the Mac about 5 years ago.  One of the problems I've had consistently even going back to my PC days, is the ocasional need for the ability to tweak an image so that it can be used in a PowerPoint deck or a document.  Some examples:

1. Cropping
2. Edge treatments (borders, scallops, irregular shapes)
3. Transparency
5. Removing background (what's referred to as ""alpha masking"")
6. Converting from one file type to another
7. Reducing file size
8. Shrinking images to fit a specific pixel-by-pixel constraint
9. Layering text onto an image
10. Combining multiple images into a single image
11. Adding drop-shadows to images
12. Changing background colors of an image

Since converting converting to Mac, I've grown to love Aperture for storing and ""editing"" photos.  It is great for adjusting exposure, white balance, etc.  However, it does not do any of the things I mentioned in my list above (other than file resizing and exporting).  This is where a program like Pixelmator comes in.  Yes, Photoshop can do all this stuff (and arguably do it better than Pixelmator).  However, the learning curve for Photoshop is incredibly daunting (just watch someone work in it that uses it every day and it will make your head spin).  The cost is another issue - unless you are doing it for a living, spending $600 or $700 on editing software just doesn't make financial sense.  Again, this is where Pixelmator comes in.

Even though I use it once a month (or sometimes less), I can always accomplish my tasks in Pixelmator within a few minutes, even if it means quickly refreshing my memory by reading the online help or looking at a Youtube video.  It really is easy to learn and use.  Depending on your needs (if they are like mine, for example) it will probably be more than you ever need!  I have never ran into a situation where Pixelmator prevented me from accomplishing a task because of limitations of its feature set.

The program is relatively light weight (doesn't take up gigs of space), and manipulates even large files quickly and easily.  I've opened up 50mb TIFF files and tweaked them, exported them, resized them, etc. without any bogging in my 2007 vintage Macbook Pro.  The program runs even better on my 2009 vintage MBP with 8mb of RAM, but it also ran fine with just 4 MB before I upgraded.

Bottom line, if you are looking for an image editing companion to your normal business software suite - one that will allow you more creative capabilities in your PowerPoint (or Keynote) decks, your  documents, contracts, white papers, etc. then Pixelmator may be the best (and most bang-for-the-buck) alternative on the market."
"I wanted to donate my computer to a local school, but wanted to erase my personal information off of it first. Even before purchasing, the customer support staff patiently and quickly answered my questions. WipeDrive was easy to use with clear prompts, and did exactly what I wanted. I chose the single wipe option, so it only took about 40 minutes, but after reinstalling the operating system I checked and nothing was left. The product was cheaper than a few of the others I looked at and I was very impressed with the support and the clarity of the instructions they gave. I would definitely recommend this product."
"Every once in a while, the program just freezes up and I have to completely get out of the program.  I usually don't save as I go along the way, so I lose my work.  Other than that, it was exactly what I was looking for!  A simple program that allows me to design many types of homes!"
"buy it buy it buy it, you won't be dessapointed, its fantastic the dinamism, how it works."
Sucks
perfect !
Good buy
A few of the games on the disc would not load. Not worth the effort returning it for a new disc.
great product for keeping track of personal finances. always on top of banking and purchasing data. Able to budget effectively
"This software is easy to setup, but does require Java. It is true, as a previous review states, that this version does not have any date information in it, but their new 2.0 version, also available on Amazon, does. The software does what it says it does and does it pretty well."
i guess part of the rating comes from the fact that i believe the government - federal and state - should provide us the tools we need to pay taxes.  there's just something incongruous paying to pay
I have used Quicken in the past and I like its features.  I use it for both home and business.
"I remember when I would spend hours upon hours of trying to beat the stages for it.  I myself am a hardcore gamer, and I really thrive for a goal when I play a game. I really love my RPG's, but other than those, this is about the only other game i've ever played that I have spent anywhere near the amount of time I have on an RPG.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone that likes to use their imagination, and have fun building."
"Installs very easily and installs as a new version; so if you have an older version, it will still be there to use (or delete).  It is easy to use, especially if you had a previous version. Good cards and verses.  The weakest link in this program is its graphics.  Compared to other card programs, Hallmark's graphics are ok.  Some graphics remind you of the 50s pictures.  But there are a lot of graphics that can be used.  I have been using the program for many years and am satisfied with the results."
"After purchaing this software to change from Quickbooks, I learned the information in Quickbooks is not as easy to convert, and only converts names, etc.  Also the customer service is also non-existant.  After sitting on hold forever.  I could get the software to work, kept giving me errors, keeping me in a continual look to keep entering information and than giving me an error.  I sent the software back since I was unable to use and was unable to get the software update and tax update refunded.  Be careful"
"This product has some of the best protection for on-line transactions. The product was able to view and secure my bank portal and allowed me to conduct my on-line transactions in a secure form. I am very happy to see that Symantec has moved into this space and providing added security to people like myself that do lots of pruchase on the internet.

This is truly a revolutionary product for the consumer."
"I got my Microsoft Certification in NT 4 and decided I needed to upgrade my certification to Win2K.  I have been running this product for a good 8 months. My opinion is that this is simply the best OS product Microsoft has put out for the desktop, and may be the best product MS has put out period (especially when compared against ME). Mind you that some older hardware and software are not fully-compatible with Win2k. However, if you have a newer machine it is a great product to have. It is extremely hard to crash this OS. The basic drawback to it is that some software will not run correctly, but with a little looking, you can generally know ahead of time which titles won't run properly."
Purchasing Norton 360 through Amazon rather than  at the local computer store saved me over $20.  This is the security recommended by my computer and I wanted to renew my introductory free 3-month subscription but even renewing on line would have cost me $10 more.  I think I got a great deal.
good for my older computers
Best software  for personal recordkeeping. Easy to follow and Amazon price is the lowest you will find
Anyone can use this software. It is so user friendly.  It seems to be doing it's job so far.  I have not had any problems. It seems to be doing everything it says it does.
"I was new to Vista when I received my new laptop, so I wasn't aware of the changing software landscape that seems to be a hallmark of Microsoft products.  Although I did get the Microsoft Office Suite, it now excludes Outlook.  This made me very, very angry.

When the opportunity to review this latest incarnation of Outlook came along, I jumped at it, because life post-Outlook is pretty awful. And, now that I'm back in the warm bosom of Microsoft's email program, I can breathe a sigh of relief.

This is the same Outlook you either love or hate.  The programs still seem to be developed independently of each other. There's also junk email scanning which is semi-useful if you don't have spam blocking on your server side. The Reading Pane is omnipresent but removable and there's this irritating tendency to group messages into, well, groups, as if the entire world thought that would be a good idea for message sorting.  News flash: It isn't. Fortunately, it can be turned off.

The calendar is the same as other Outlook calendars, only a little more graphically appealing.  You still cannot easily import data from one of the Outlook programs to the other; dragging and dropping emails preserves body and header.  Similarly, you can drag an email to your contacts, but that only drops the email name into the contacts list and dumps the entire body into Notes field.  In other words, there's no smart way to navigate content between the various sub-programs within Outlook.  This is something that's sorely needed.  The electronic signature at the bottom of emails is becoming the de facto business card, and it'd be nice if we could just import that content right into Contacts.  But alas, Outlook's not about to be THAT innovative.

The other new thing that hangs around, waiting for you to notice it, is the To-Do Bar.  As if navigating the myriad of Outlook programs who don't really like each other wasn't difficult enough, you are now expected to navigate sideways.  From a space perspective, this makes sense; there's more real estate on the horizontal axis of most monitors.  But it is counterintuitive to the rest of the Outlook design, which is top to bottom. The To-Do Bar is basically what used to happen when you clicked on your name in older versions of Outlook: it summarizes all your relevant information in one place. The problem is that it won't go away easily. It eventually goes away if you can figure out how to ask it nicely.  But apparently each application is treated like its own entity, so removing the To-Do Bar from say, email, means it still shows up when you're in Tasks.

Finally there's what's new in this version of Outlook, the Business Contact Manager.  It requires SQL server. This is most useful if you're running a business, and contains everything from projects to accounts, billable hours to marketing campaigns.  It's of particular use to freelancers and hourly consultants; as a consultant myself once, I ended up using the journal to clock my progress, but the BCM can do it better.  Being the new kid on the block, BCM is better integrated with all the other programs.

At times, Outlook's various programs seem like squabbling in-laws at a wedding...related and not happy about it.  If you can look past that - and if you're a seasoned Outlook user, chances are you're used to it - then this is definitely worth the investment."
"Imagine if Microsoft Word crashed every time a period or capital letter was used or when opening saved documents some of the paragraphs appeared twice.  Such is the state of affairs of Microsoft Money 2005.  I have been using Microsoft Money since 1996; while it was never perfect, it basically did what it promised.  I have also used the portfolio manager on the MSN website which is a subset of the Money program with a similar interface. Others have written about problems downloading bank and credit card statements; this review will focus on the portfolio manager.

The portfolio manager is the part of Money that keeps track of investment accounts. It is not unusual for multiple income families to own quite complicated investment portfolios including 401Ks, IRAs and college savings accounts.  Something went very wrong in the fall of 2004 when Microsoft upgraded their software to Money 2005.  Gone is the ability to analyze a single account or groups of accounts; you are forced to analyze your entire portfolio.  When entering new equity transactions, Money used to allow you to simply enter the trading symbol and it would quickly find the name of the company and other information, now you must follow a wizard and enter the information manually.  Previously, you could enter a back dated transaction and it would guess a price using the closing price for the day (this is very useful for watch accounts); now you must manually enter the information.

The worse part has been the removal of the associated cash accounts.  I never really appreciated the separate cash accounts until Microsoft removed them.  For those unfamiliar with software, here is the basic concept.  Say you own an account with a discount broker like Fidelity or Vanguard that holds six mutual funds.  Associated with that account is a cash account in which you add and remove cash, collect dividends and conduct other transactions into and out of the account.  When you sell a mutual fund, the proceeds are put into the cash account; similarly, cash is taken from the account when you buy shares of an investment.  Prior versions of Money created a distinct cash account associated with a specific investment account.  You could open the account, view the transaction history and correct any errors.  In Money 2005, when you create a new account it simply asks for the initial cash balance.  Money then automatically mismanages this account by recording dividends twice and mishandling sales proceeds.  Furthermore, money will not allow you to record interest dividends, contributions or redemptions.  There is no way to view the history at all; Money simply gives you the current value in a little box.  When errors occur, the fix from Microsoft is to simply change the amount in the little box to the correct value.  If you access the cash account too often it begins to create multiple cash accounts labeled #2, #3 leading to cash account nightmare.

Microsoft did an upgrade to the software this weekend (May 20, 2005).  They have added more features and unfortunately more bugs; I have not noticed anything that has been fixed.  New problems include: 1) updates are no longer stored on the MSN server preventing you from accessing up-to-date account information from multiple computers (this may be a temporary problem); 2) investments that lack a trading symbol, such as specialty funds available through certain 401Ks or 529 plans, are no longer supported.  You can see the investment in your portfolio but you cannot record ""buys"" or other transactions; 3) information contained in watch accounts, such as year-to-date performance was lost after the upgrade.

I hope once Microsoft is finished adding features to their Money 2005 software they will work on bringing it from Alpha to Beta quality.  Perhaps, after a year or two of Beta testing, Microsoft will be ready to release Money 2005 (or 2008) for general sale.  Until then, I do not see how they can legally be selling software that fails to perform its basic functions."
"Absolutely love it. I have used Autocad, Chief architect and a few others, but like this the best."
"For me it is still one of the best tax softwares and since I did my prior taxes with it, it was first choice. I guess there were some justified critique since Inuit deleted some features but did not communicate this properly giving the impression that nothing changed compared to last year. So I was glad that this did not concern me!"
"They've really improved the budget function this year, but still doesn't support the auto creation of a budget based on the previous year's actuals."
"Quickbooks runs our business for us. My wife, who does all of our books, insisted on it. The improvements in 2012 are excellent. She raves about them. We have rather complicated books because of three separate businesses, two of which are related. On top of that, we have different organizations that need to see different aspects of our books. This program makes managing all of that simple and easy. As one of our businesses has expanded the versatility of QB has been evident. I know there are people who don't like it but I say buy it. If you are a Mac person, this is the best out there and it rocks."
Good antivirus
"I have used Norton Anti-Virus products on my computer since its purchase in 2002 and have not had one problem.  That is why I decided to buy the 2006 version.  Bad choice on my part.  I spent an entire weekend, using 10 hours of my time and 6 phone calls to their customer service line, only to find out after numerous installations and un-installations, that this particular version was not compatible with my computer.  The only compliment I can pay Amazon is that I received it quickly and was given a credit equally as quickly.  I ended up with McAfee as my 2006 anti-virus and have been extremely happy."
"I have been using Quicken for over 15 years. The first time I had serious problems with it (mostly response was bad) was in 2003/2004. When I got 2005, I decided to keep as long as I can. In 2007, I got the new one and am very disappointed. It has many problems and is very unstable. I cannot validate my datafile, and quicken intermittently displays blank screen and hangs at startup. I finally figured out that there is some bad interaction with Norton Conf. and un-installed it.

Overall, I am not happy with Quicken and am seriously considering switching to MS Money for the first time in 15 years."
"I have used Print Shop in the past with my PC's with no problems, but I now have an iMac and I've had all kinds of problems with this software."
"This is totally an amazing software!

It makes learning piano fun and interesting. The lessons make it completely easy to understand piano!
This is definitely worth the price. It works on Windows 7 as well! :)

Only two things:
1. Make sure that you buy a midi cable. One that connects the keyboard to the computer. Such as a USB Midi Cable Converter PC to a Music Keyboard. (Buying one of those is really inexpensive.)
2.  Make sure that the keyboard you have is a midi keyboard. (Preferably about 61 keys or more will do it.)

"I am upgrading from Pagis scanning software produced by the same company. I decided to upgrade to Paperport 8.0 last week (3/10/03) Right after I got my copy I saw on the Scansoft website that a new version is out already, 9.0. An upgrade is listed as $....
The program works fine. Seems a little less powerful in some of the editing and file manipulation abilities of pagis. It works better with Windows XP. One glitch, it cannot directly import my Pagis files with an *.XIF format! I have read that the new version (9.0) has a pagis importer built in.
My overall comment: If you are upgrading from Pagis wait for version 9.0 to be widely available. So I now have to upgrade or buy the newer version to have XIF compatibility?"
Pc broke less then a month after purchase no contact information on how to get a refund or to get another key code. Waste of cash.
Exactly what I wanted and quick delivery
Best language program I have every used. Really sinks in your head if you are faithful to the program. These guys have really hit a home run with this program.
"When I purchased this security protection for the coming year, I never expected it to be so far behind all the others that I've ever used. Firstly, upon receiving the disc in the mail, I initiated an immediate FULL SCAN just to be sure that there were no major threats to start. When the FULL SCAN was completed, 5 nasty Trojan viruses were reported as present. To remove them, the (AVG) program declared that the program must reboot to complete the scan process. But when the ""day 2"" FULL scan was performed, just to double check the thorough process of the first scan, the same viruses were identified as ""present & accounted for, sir!"". That's troubling news when I've maintained sufficient anti-virus protection to this PC without a pause. Then, this program (allegedly) finds major threats, completes the scan-&-reboot to remove them, and promptly fails the test of a true good anti-virus security protection to complete what it's meant to do--take out the bad threats & remove the problems!
I can only guess but I would surmise that most PC users would find an AVG FULL SCAN, which requires a reboot, to complete its so-called removal, to be unacceptably time-consuming & grossly inefficient (i.e. especially when the reboot-removal doesn't do what it supposed to do! Other Anti-virus programs remove threat problems by two major & primary means: 1. deletion <OR> 2. Quarantine. This one does neither as an option to handle such threats!!
A PC reboot which doesn't accomplish the scan process to remove a virus threat is neither a practical nor efficient means of Anti-virus security software. In summary, I rate this brand of Internet Security protection as a ""1"" just to be kind. It's too ineffective to be regarded seriously as worthy of prime consideration for a year of major PC security protection. TRY ELSEWHERE !!!"
"My kids and I now use this. Note that the Office Home and Student edition (this specific edition) DOES NOT include the OneDrive (cloud) storage that comes with the ""365"" edition. The 365 edition is also a license for up to 5 computers, this edition is a SINGLE (1) license.  Allows you to install the apps or use the apps via a browser. It is far faster than older versions of office that we were using. Fast install. This is KeyCard which is just a number that you associate with your Microsoft online account and then can use to install to any one computer from online. Of course you can sync via OneDrive to mobile and the mobile apps are free downloads."
"It was a game I was looking for and Amazon had it for the right price.  I enjoy the graphics.

When I want to purchase something else I will look on Amazon first."
Great program ... user friendly and very very helpful. I've used TurboTax for years and wouldn't do my taxes any other way.
"I prefer the old versions of Ms Office, for in this version the Word program is too complicated to find simple command like SAVE and to create a new page.

Clearly the people who came up with this version did not think of the people who have been using various Microsoft Office items such as Ms Word from 1997, therefore even after taking the tutorial online for the 2010 version I do not feel comfortable in using it so I have gone back to my old version of Microsoft Office in order to use the Word program.

I have noted also that even reading my old Word documents that had been sent to me as an attachment is a problem for they are coming up in read only form in this Ms Office version so I have to copy and paste in order to edit each document, on my old version all I had to do was SAVE AS in order to create a new version for editing."
No desktop client for Mac. Boooooo!
this is truly the easiest home design software i've found.  i love it.  the price is reasonable for all you get.  super easy to learn!
"Quickbooks does not fit with the retail accounting I do, but I am forced to use it as our accountant wants me to."
good
"About all I can say for this product it did not help my defective PC, but nothing else would have fixed it either it turns out that even the motherboard was corrupt, it probably would have worked in a normal problem with the computer."
"My daughter loves this game.  However, once she completed it she started to become bored.  More challenges as the kids get older need to be added.  However, I like the skills she has learned from it."
"Took me more time to get the software to work than to use it.  Have used TurboTax for Windows for years. I enter all my return information and save it. When I tried to open it again, the MAC software asks me to log into my INTUIT.COM account. Yet the file will never open. Tried multiple downloads, multiple ""new"" returns, etc. and it is a total waste of time. Spent at least 4 hours on the phone with Intuit under three cases, #####6529, ####9247, and #####5157. During the 3rd case, I installed the Windows version, and my files from 2014 and 2015 still would not work. None of the reps or the escalation reps above them could answer why this was happening. At the end of the third support session, I received an email from the rep escalating this issue again. Three hours later, still no answer.  I finally figured this out - somehow the software connects your tax file to your Intuit account. I thought it was standalone, being installed software. There was a very old userID associated with my email address, and my email address was the second userID. During a fourth call, I finally got the rep to issue a password reset for the very old userID. Once I got that reset, I was able to open the 2014 file. The 2015 file was not openable by the MAC version or the Windows version using the updated account info. So I entered my 2015 info for the 3rd time and e-filed. DONE."
Good software but it is a pain that you have to but it every year.
"I am lucky that I did not buy this piece of expensive software; my accountants furnished it. Even so, I really hate using it. It is not intuitive, it is difficult to find things in the program, and it takes very simple actions and turns them into complicated events. They have removed quite a few features from this version of the program, as well, so you are paying more for less. The help search is very poor. Just so you know, I have used Quicken for my personal finances for years and have no real complaints about it, and I have used several other business accounting packages in my 20 years of NPO management.

The program has a charming way of changing its own settings from one session to the next.  Just today QB decided not to open. I had to download a run file from Microsoft and install that, now it is reporting a different error about registration data. I have to get that info from the accountants, so that will make me wait a couple more days. (They purchase 3 license packs, so I don't have the box.) I have made no changes to the computer or programs, yet this kind of file issue/error has happened three times since the program was installed. It is running on a new computer that has no issues with any other software. By the way, unless you have a really fast and capable computer, this software is a resource hog and a nightmare to run. Quickbooks is the main reason I needed a new computer.

All in all, I cannot recommend it. Given its problems, I am considering alternatives for our accounting software."
Just what I wanted. Got the job done and a few bucks back!
"I have used Turbotax since its inception, but of course this year I returned it after I discovered the mess they made of it.  I ordered Taxcut from Amazon which came free shipping and no sales tax, a good deal. Since 1949 I have done my taxes, today in addition to my taxes I do my son's business taxes, schedule C etc. and my two granddaughters taxes.  They each downloaded from the 2001 Turbotax program into Taxcut without any problems.  After using Turbotax for so many years I had to learn the Taxcut way of doing things but that was no problem they make it all very easy.  I am impressed with Taxcut and will use it hereafter. All the necessary forms for the refunds were in the box with the addresses.  Reading the problems of others in importing from Turbotax or not finding return addresses for refunds I rather think it is the computer operator rather than a diabolical scheme perpetrated by H&R Block."
Provided everything I needed to complete my taxes and gave me with the confidence that it was thorough and accurate.
"The 2009 release 'Land of the Lost' is yet another film in a long line of films whose success or failure is dependent on Will Ferrell's ability to entertain the audience. If you enjoy what Will does you'll most likely adore this film. If you don't, well you know how that goes. I will say that I went into viewing this one not expecting much. I believe my low expectations actually helped me enjoy it more than I otherwise would have.

""Land of the Lost' contains all the expected elements found in a Will Ferrell movie; lots of slapstick and physical comedy, moments of surprisingly inappropriate material for the adolescent members of the audience and of course large doses of Will's character (i.e.: Dr. Rick Marshall) rambling on in a narcissistic frenzy about his personal greatness and unrecognized genius. With these egotistical pontifications so prevalent in all of his films one must eventually begin to wonder just how much of this behavior is extracted from real life?

Be that as it may, the storyline is rather cute, the special effects very good and Dr. Marshall's love interest played by Anna Friel is, shall I say, delightful. All and all worth at least one viewing.  My Rating: -3 1/2 Stars-."
"The listing says Platform is XP, which is totally outdated info, because I can confirm that it works fine with Windows 10.

Difficult to find this old version at a fair price, but I found it here.  Bought for a friend who purchased a new computer (Win 10), but couldn't find his CD for this program.  From what I've read online, 2006 is the last good version of this program, before it was made overly complicated.  I created an image file from the CD, in case he loses this disc also."
"Great Product, in terms of level of protection, ease of installation and updating.  They often prompt you to subscribe to the paid service which is fair enough.  Just watch what you click.  It has become more intrusive than it was: warnings popping up from the bottom right corner of your screen a couple of times a day.  Just click no."
"bought this for my son, it has worked out beautifully. Great price and great quality. good buy for this family."
"I've had mixed experiences with Intuit products in general. Many of the times I experience issues with them locking up, not saving, corrupting files, and so forth. With this product, I did not experience that.

I purchased this software for a couple business returns I needed to file and was surprised at how easy it was to navigate through the various sections that needed to be filled out. The results were good and the return printed appropriately. The eFile worked well, too, and the return was accepted by the IRS within 8 hours.

I plan on purchasing the product again for my 2014 business returns. I wish they would include the personal 1040 return preparation feature with this, especially for the money you're paying. Unfortunately, you have to buy that separately, AND pay additional money to be able to prepare a state tax return with your federal.

All in all, I'd give the software a 4-star. There are improvements that could be made; there are features that should be added; but as it is, it does what it's designed to do and it doesn't take very long to get the hang of it, get your information entered, and get the returns submitted."
"After being disappointed with new Ad-Aware 2007 (not ready yet for prime time), I searched for other anti-spyware applications and found Zone Alarm highly rated. But .... after installation, I noticed that boot-up time doubled, as well as shut down. Getting on the computer is now very sloooooooow. Frustrating. Ad-Aware was never like this. So, be forewarned. If Zone Labs could fix this resource-hog issue, the product would easily make 5 stars. Four stars is toward the quality of protection only."
Doesnt work for my computer.
"There are some serious advancements in this version. Worth the upgrade although I wish they would sell an upgraded version as a posed to making us purchase at new version prices. Oh well, no advantage to loyalty."
"I have always liked Mcafee.  Buying it through Amazon has always been painless.  It was delivered on scheduled and it was a very easy transaction.

The price is excellent and it has three licenses for my three computers. It installed fairly easily and I have not had any problems with it."
not original
The price was just right and the program is very good
"Although this is not the actual turbo tax we use (we file in 2 states, fed., have a home business, etc.), I got this for my daughter.  We did her taxes already, and she was more than thrilled.  Went super fast and easy, built her confidence to continue doing her own taxes from here on out.  She can file our home state for free on the state website, so this was perfect for her.  Great learning tool.  I can't say enough about turbo tax, we've used it many years and will continue to do so.  If you have a complicated return, there are other editions that will do the job for you, too.  Never had any problems, and love the fact that it forwards our previous returns into the new year files, so handy.  Great Product!"
"Been using this product for 3 months now and have had no problems.  It's simple to use and easy to load.  Just follow the instructions.  Once it's on, the program practically works all by itself without any problems, and downloads new updates every so often too.

Recommended."
Love being able to listen to my music from the cloud on my phone
"This DVD is really expensive but it was conceived, produced, and created at a very high level.  They describe everything they do from camera, to lighting to location and support team.  They even discuss editing post production."
"slowed down pc, did not find 53 items that were harmful to pc. does nothing don't waste money. Way to go if you want to waste 15 minutes for search to load.  Bought lots stuff from amazon, this by far lets say end of the universe is the worst product, wasted 25 dollars from disabled vet, shame on you."
This product does not work on windows 7 they need to update this product or stop selling this product........it does not work at all.......it was a waist of my money.
Great product
I have been getting Norton 360 for some time now.  It does a lot more than just virus protection.  For the money it is a good tool to own.
I've been a die hard pc user but now that Apple has caught up in the processor speed department I bought a laptop.  I'm still getting used to the unique Mac functions and Toast has helped me with some hurdles.  I've used Roxio 9 on the pc so I  bought the Mac equivalent.  There are a lot of similarities so it was an easy transition.  There is the auto data id system for songs which I found wasn't in previous Toast versions.  I like that I can compress a dual layer disk into a regular dvd since the former is expensive.  I've also gotten into tivo since it supports computer viewing.  I can even edit the tivo files and discard unnecessary footage.  This makes it even easier to back them up on disks and my iPod.  Blu-ray is now the next generation format and Toast burns this format.  It is a great program for dealing with video and music.
Have this protection on all my devices. Just one of the best.
"Right now this is all the antivirus I have on my laptop. I get better protection from this than I did from iobit. Amazon has outdone itself with this free offer. I buy a lot from Amazon and find the whole company great, especially the freebies."
Very old software. Old graphics etc. Multiple disks.
great for taxes
"I have windows XP--- Do you have Hallmark Comedy Studio that can be used on XP?  Or Hallmark Studio software that contains MAXINE? If so, I would like to purchase it A.S.A.P.
THANK YOU!"
"I wasn't expecting a whole heck of a lot from this, having never heard of Redoubt Software before, but I was pleasantly surprised. These tables are all fun to play; even the older ""Lost World"" table. ""Lost World"" has no background music however, which may be realistic, but it does sound empty compared to the others, which all have full music soundtracks.

 And speaking of sound, the digital effects are all astounding, except for when the ball hits against a non-scoring item, like a side rail or a corner post. Then you get a lame tick-like sound that is scratchy and sounds like something is wrong with your sound card. But this quibble doesn't detract much from the overall enjoyment.
 Graphics are first-rate. The tables are all very colorful and accurate renditions of the actual tables. My only other gripe would be that the angle of view is non-adjustable, and you can't see much of what is going on at the top end of the tables. Variable viewing angles would have been a very nice option.
 Also, the physics engine is excellent, resulting in lifelike gameplay. Overall, a very worthwhile investment for all pinball fans. And if you like this collection, I also recommend ""Pinball Madness 3"", which contains 10 more tables from Redoubt Software in their earlier days along with some (...) tables from 21st Century. I would recommend ""Pinball Madness 3"" only for the Redoubt tables however; and be warned: ""PM3"" is difficult to get up and running on some computers.  Conversely, ""Williams Pinball Classics"" installed beautifully."
Very good product it's got lots of activities for my children to use.  I would definitely recommend this product for someone trying to learn how to type.
"A perfect app for my personal use. Not wishing to deal with MS Word and its complexities, iWork fills a perfect niche on my MacBook Pro. And, it's Apple-intuitive, so the learning curve is a cinch!"
Thank You
Couldn't get it to work with my Dell inspiron. When I inserted it the computer still says this disk does not contain password reset software. Not to say it won't work but if it does I don't know how to use it and the instructions sure don't tell me
"I'd say their support was bad but it was NONEXISTENT! 3 unanswered emails and 45 min. on hold before I hung up. Web based support cases get automatically 'CLOSED' with no more than an automated response 'check our support links'. BAD, BAD, BAD."
I didn't have teh time to used it or practice.... so far what i saw it looks like 3 stars
"Have it installed on my computer. Now I'm  going to take pictures. Stay tuned for my results. Seen this software with a family member, and the results were amazing. I already rate it a Four Star ..."
"I have used Quicken in various iterations for years and years - usually Deluxe or Home & Business - and though the bugs abound, I'm fine with it. Can't run my life without it in fact.

I used it to manage all my rentals by using categories and reports just fine. In 2010 I 'upgraded' to Quicken Rental Property Manager 2010. And I find the rental property features to be less than useless - really - and I went back to using Quicken the way I always did.

The tracking of tenants is far too limited, it doesn't allow for partial payments, it can't handle lease renewals, security deposit tracking is a nightmare - it is handled as a liability account which I don't get at all - and add all of the issues mentioned by previous posters...don't waste your money on this product. Just buy Quicken Deluxe or Home & Business."
"The product was new and excellent, as expected. I didn't opt for any special shipping and it took a little longer than I expected."
Fast and easy. We enter the information and TurboTax does the work. If you use TurboTax each year the information you enter is less because your personal information is already there. Best of all you get your money sent directly to your bank in about two weeks.
"You can only order the e-version by credit card. I gave them a credit card that would expire prior to my next renewal and surprise the WSJ managed to put thru a charge anyway. As stated in the other reviews there is nothing in the site labeled cancel subscription. So once they have your number- watch out, unless you are willing to spend a LONG LONG time on the PHONE (i.e. not computer) trying to get your charges reversed. I personally believe both items are purposeful, only taking a charge card and then offering no on line method to cancel the subscription. Customer service is a JOKE!!!!"
Best place to buy this project. Symantec kept trying to sell me this directly for $20 dollars more.
"Unless you really need the updated maps, I would not upgrade from Streets and Trips 2007.
* The 2008 version is the first one with a product key that needs to be registered.  I assume this means I can no longer sell or give away the old version when I buy the new one.  So I won't be upgrading every year anymore.
* After I did the install, it corrupted a dll that Money 2007 uses.  I had to reinstall Money to get it working again."
"The download process at Amazon works well.  I'm not thrilled about the latest version of this H&R Block at Home 2010 Deluxe.  The Deduction Pro is online.  Deduction Pro is painful for charitable contributions.  You also can't edit it once you've completed an entry if it has more than 50 items in it.  I had to go back and edit it because I had the wrong year on a contribution (the calender doesn't default to 2010).  It won't allow you to edit the date or any items if there are more that 50 items in it.  That's rediculous.  I had to delete the entry and create a new one.  Finding the donated items in their drop down lists is slow and painful.  Reentering over 50 items is a giant waste of my time.  Once completed, you then tell the H&R program where the downloaded 'deduction pro' file is.  I have yet to find the web link (again) in the program to get to the Deduction Pro website."
I love Apple Computers and their software. I don't like the lack of support and frustration trying to register this product when we don't buy directly from Apple.  I spent an unbelievable amount of hours trying to get this matter resolved.  It took almost 8 weeks of e-mails.  There isn't any other way to communicate with Apple in regard to this software.
"I haven't installed the 2014 version yet. I have used Norton for several years and have been happy, since I haven't had any problems."
Just as good as always. Still too high priced.
"I just got MacSpeech Dictate today, and am using it to type this review. I'm really impressed. I've tried to use voice dictation software before, but have never gotten it to work efficiently. Since I have cerebral palsy, typing is very difficult for me. MacSpeech Dictate is the first software I've found that actually helps me to use the computer faster. It doesn't seem to have any trouble with my slight speech impediment, and it's doing well as my voice gets tired. I would recommend this software to anyone with a disability who needs to be able to use the computer at a normal pace.

One note: the user guide that comes with the software is woefully inadequate. It's taken me most of the night to figure out how to do simple editing and formatting tasks. But once you get the hang of it, this is great stuff."
"I am a long time user of Quicken, and 2014 is pretty much what I expected.  I bought it because I just upgraded to Windows 8.1.  I have been using 2014 for about a week, and it was easy to load and input my data from an older version.  The only problem I have had is that it locked up a couple of times while I was using the budget feature."
"But this CD-ROM kept crashing my otherwise-stable machine. Anyone with small children knows that frustration is easily felt by little ones, and I finally had to stop using the game because my 2 year-old was getting too upset when the game crashed. Also, the suggested ages - 1 1/2 to 3 - may be incorrect. Only one game is well suited to little ones (Shapes & Colors) because the child can simply hit any key. The others require more sophisticated motor skills and understanding."
"I have been using Ubuntu since Vista first came out and never looked back. However I only install LTS versions because I know they are stable and will be supported the longest. When I installed the last LTS (12.04 LTS), I purchased the DVD from LinuxFreak.  I could have gotten it free by ordering it from Ubuntu, but that takes quite awhile to receive it. So I ordered it from Amazon.com and got it in two days. To me the cost is nominal. So I decided to again order from LinuxFreak via Amazon.com. I know that I might still have a problem, so to be safe I always back up everything twice to an external drive, once with a backup program and then I copy the ""home"" folder to the external drive. I also export bookmarks, etc. ""just in case"". Then I connect to internet using wired connection (ethernet) and I make sure the laptop is fully charged and plugged in. Then it is a simple act of putting the DVD in that ends up never being simple. I had to get into bios to have it boot from the CD/DVD drive instead of the harddrive. That took many attempts to get to that configuration screen instead of constantly bringing up the current Ubuntu operating system. That problem has nothing to do with Ubuntu; in my case it is a Dell problem. Once that works, there are only a few screens. The paperwork (one sheet of paper) that comes with the DVD is all one needs for instructions. I make sure to check 2 boxes on the screen, get the updates while installing and install the 3rd party software. And since I am upgrading and don't have Windows, I select upgrade when it sees that I have Ubuntu 12.04 installed. You can select to replace Windows if it sees that you have Windows or have it so that you keep Windows and also have Ubuntu. You can also use the DVD to boot from and just try out Ubuntu. It went through the whole process and it seemed to be a successful installation, but when after removing the DVD and it restarted, it came up with some kind of error (file missing or something). So I reloaded the DVD. It saw that I had Ubuntu 14.04 and asked did I want to reinstall totally or do I want to reinstall while keeping my documents, etc. I chose the latter and it went through the whole process again. But this time when it restarted after installation, it was just fine. I only had a few apps and programs that were removed because they were downlevel for 14.04, but I just searched for them from the software center and got the versions for 14.04. Some had enhanced functions in the later release, so that was good. Bottom line, everything you need to either try Ubuntu out or to install it is that DVD and the instructions sheet. It is not complicated. In a couple of years, I figure I will be doing it again for 16.04..."
"The package arrived in great condition.
Kaito V3 comes with Studio One (a Digital Audio Workstation) and the vst Piapro Studio. His voicebanks can be used within Piapro Studio, but I highly recommend buying the V3/V4 editor first as I feel like they are much more stable and simpler to use in general.

Kaito V3 comes with 4 voicebanks; ""Whisper"", ""Soft"", ""English"", and his core ""Straight"" voicebank.
Compared to his V1, he is generally softer. higher, and more nasally in tone. His voicebanks are pretty decent in quality,
but they aren't very versatile. He has a very limited vocal range and can't sing high. Generally, Kaito V3 works best with soft ballad/rock type songs, but his Straight and English can also be used for pop. I find his Soft voicebank to be the most pleasant in tone. With the VOCALOID 4 editor, cross synthesizing his Soft and Straight voicebanks can give you the best results. His English can be a bit weird at times, but with editing, its one of the better English Vocaloid3 voicebanks available. If you are looking for a more deep, solid and masculine type vocal, I would highly recommend you getting either Gackpoid or VY2V3 instead. Overall, Kaito V3 can get the job done, but I wouldn't recommend him as your first Vocaloid just because of how limited he is."
"All issues with the Cloud Drive platform feature set aside this application is buggy, or the backing service is buggy.

It does not handle large files. I tried uploading a 30GB disk image and it never actually completed. I checked the log and it would continually cancel the transaction or would fail once all the data had been uploaded. The application itself does not show the status of a single upload, so it just keeps chugging along uploading and failing endlessly. In either case I spent well over a week trying to upload one file over and over again.

Uploading folders full of small files is a little better, but there still seem to be a large amount of upload failures (retrying...) even for small files. This makes me worry that some of my files may end up getting skipped as there is no way to verify all the files have been uploaded. The web user interface provides no way to get a count of files and folders under a given directory.

The service as a would be a economical way to store data and nostalgia that I don't access all the frequently, which is why I can put up with the lack of a sync feature. However, for cloud storage trust is everything and based on what I have seen from the quality of the software so far I have no faith anything I put in Amazon cloud drive is even going to get there let alone be there when I want to access it in the distant future."
"This service is as good as the old Zune was, but not quite as good with suggestions as Zune. Also, the phone interface is a bit counter-intuitive. I'm sure they'll get it figured out. It is a good bargain. Another thing about the Zune - you got 10 free ""yours to keep"" downloads per month, which made that service really worth it. I wish Amazon Music would consider that."
"This is a great program for me.  As I have gotten older, typing has become more difficult and I find myself spending more time correcting than creating.  Once I got Dragon, I have quit spending much time correcting typing errors. Even without training it, the program was over 98% accurate.  With training, that went up to near perfection, excepting some proper names and foreign phrases."
"One star is too generous.  This is the worst piece of junk software I have ever attempted to use.  It could have been written by a 10 year old amateur.

Received it today.  Eagerly installed it on my Retina Mac.  Depressing.
Pathetic. Amateurish. An insult to Macintosh users.  If Intel wanted to offend and insult Mac users they have succeeded spectacularly.

Almost no options to customize the register.  Text is so small my eyes are still burning.  Three choices for text, all inadequate.  Compared to the Windows version this is outrageous.

By now you know how I feel.  I ordered the disk version.  Just hope that Intuit will honor the 60 day satisfaction offer."
"I have used AVG products for many years and been extremely satisfied with them.  Installation was a breeze and the product is minimally intrusive.

Scans do not seem to suck up much in the way or resources (one failing of some products out there)

The real test is how well does it work.  Ive never had anything get past undetected that I am aware of.  I am a professional in the computer business with 30 years of experience and know that no system is perfect.  So I back up my protection by scanning the drive remotely with other anti-virus software along with prudent security practices. (I use a different programs on each of my home systems in case on fails to protect.  Something trying to spread will likely trigger alarms from one of the other guardian programs.

If you do not have current anti-virus and security software, get *something* on your system right away.  Outdated is almost the same as ""none"" and you may well already be compromised.

I recommend AVG whole-heartedly and without reservation."
"After trying it on three computers I have to say that this is the absolute worst version of Windows since ME, quite possibly WORSE.  On all systems I have been plagued with system hangs, crashes, waiting minutes for a window to open and problem after problem where windows can't find included files (the windows\system32 folder is filled with garbage).  I have now done away with over $600 worth of licences and gone back to XP because at least with XP I can be sure my computer will work again the next time I turn it on."
"I bought this to plan a large home.  At first it worked great, but once The house was about 4500 square feet and I began adding accessories (not even to landscaping or changing floors and walls) it really began slowing down.  I have well above the recommended minimum PC aspects (Win 7, 8 Gig RAM, enough hard drive)."
"I purchased this Product from Amazon in October and chose one day shipping,as I needed it urgently for my private use. Indeed,Amazon was efficient as it arrived the next day. The price is extremely reasonable and this edition of multi-sim offers great improvements over the last versions. It is definitely worth the price to acquire this version and I highly recommend this purchase."
"What else is there to say? Just more of the same with a slightly improved GUI. It still lacks functionality that it should have out of the box (auto-download of bank transactions, for instance I shouldn't have to pay for something other products do for free)."
"Works ok, Too many fees"
"The software is easy to install and calibrating is straight forward.  Works with XP and Vista. Before I got this I used a calibration picture and thought I was doing pretty well but after using the Spyder2Express I was surprised to see how far off I was, not that it was miles off just that it was noticeably better."
I love reading the New King James version of the Bible and this life application Bible is so helpful. I love having the study notes at my finger tips on my Kindle.
Perfect anti virus with a great price. I only trust McAfee and use it on all my devices. but without discount it's a little pricy!
DO NOT purchase. better one at Best Buy
What I Needed
"I have to admit-I have been using Adobe products for many years.  But after Adobe decided to alienate it's customers with the new ""subscription"" model"" ( where you have to pay for your license monthly) I have been looking for a cheaper alternative.  I've looked at some open source stuff but wasn't happy with any of it.

I like that you can buy this program and not have to worry about monthly fees.  The box set of CorelDRAW program came with a lot of free stuff like fonts, clip art, patterns, etc -always buy the hard version of software because you get more stuff with it.

I found some of the programs easy to use and others like Draw kind of difficult.  I know it will take time to sit and learn the program.  I like this program but I'm not completely sold on it for me.  If you are just starting out however, it's a great program to get for your graphics needs."
"Don't buy unless your in for a hassle..The supplied transfer cable would not fit the transfer ports. The customer service rep hung up on me when  told him of the problem, the instructors left me with one unworkable computer  After several hours of attempt still was not able to transfer from the old pc to the new pc. looks like it was a waste of money and time to try out this product. Both these computers were laptops made by HP"
"I like that quicken provides and app finally.  However, I'm a little disappointed that I can't seem to find a way to enter/update my bills with the mobile app.

I personally didn't experience the issues some other reviewers have.  In fact, the 2011 version didn't work with a few of my banks but the 2013 version does."
"Love it, it's a great beginning cartoon tool for me."
Great price for an excellent product. Protecting the whole family.
"I had trouble with the rental income section.  I got frustrated and probably was getting upset at myself for giving TurboTax my money and sucking money out of the economy.  I decided t o not be cheap and go to my regular tax lady.  I paid her more money, but she will spend that money (part of it anyway) at our local  businesses and help our local economy.

I'll never use TurboTax again and will discourage my friends from using it.

Sincerely,

Rich Cox

"I have both windows 98 second edition and windows 2000 professional. I really like the stability of the 2000 o/s best.
 I have never had any crashes. It is easier to maintain with the tools that come with it also. I do not play alot of games but use it mostly for e-mail, web browsing and some programs. This is much more stable than 98. I get alot of error messages with 98 and blue screens also. So far with 2000 I have not seen any of those yet!!!"
okay
I've used Bitdefender for several years.  I have and still love this for my laptop and with the purchase of this 2013 version I will be deleting what's on my other computer and adding Bitdefender.  Sorry Norton.
My son loves this toy story learning game for his leap pad explorer! so glad i bought it for him.
Great value from Amazon v
I keep looking for something other than TurboTax every year and am never satisfied with any of the alternatives. I keep buying TurboTax.
"Dear Sirs,
As compared with your previous version of Avery Printshop, I am very unhappy with this one. It won't allow me to open any of the many card templates I had designed and used for years. I want to be able to make photocards using Avery Postcards #8387, and this 3.0 version won't recognize that template. Furthermore, some weeks ago, we e-mailed a request for help regarding the use of the postcards mentioned above and we never received even an acknowledgement that our e-mail had been received, nevermind an answer to our question. However, we continue to receive a barrage of e-mails from Broderbund to order more items. I would not recommend this program to anyone.
Signed, Unhappy in New York"
"Beginning in 1995 I have used several different Anti-Virus soft wares, at one point I used both Norton and anti-virus software together. Early on, the two software would spontaneously set off vicious alerts . . . they were impressive (sort of scary too).  I can't remember what I did, but I was able to get both to monitor the one computer. Eventually the other software would routinely quarantine this same ROOTKIT VIRUS, but not the Norton software.

As you would suspect, I was rightfully concerned; which was the better protection.  I can't remember why, exactly, that I called the other software's customer service but the experience was as if I had just interrupted a 14 year old from their calculus homework to answer some dump question or technical problem that I should know the answer or how to solve my problem (whatever it was, I can't remember).  After hanging up the telephone I immediately uninstalled the other anti-virus software.

If I am not mistaken I have been with Norton about six or seven years now and it still has not quarantined rootkit and I do not think my computer has been attacked by anything that I may have mistakenly trusted and allowed access into my computer.

Norton's ever advancing technology now features alerts of Good, Questionable, or Bad
downloads before you start the download. There is so much more now as well.

Take a thirty (30) day trial . . . you will subscribe NORTON, by Symantec."
Outstanding Product!  Very easy to navigate through.  Thanks for bringing back the original version with forms included.
just  what i wanted
Way too complicated.
"My husband and I bought this software from [a store].  I've used Printmaster and Microsoft Home Publishing Suite to create school newsletters.  The description on the Picture It box looked promising.  It convinced me that it was better than what I've been using.  I thought it would be perfect for our brand new super duper computer.  The time it took to install this software (the maximum installation) was tolerable.  However, this software has BIG PROBLEMS!  Picture It kept crashing (""illegal operation, must be shut down"").  When we ran ""windoctor"" to find out what the error was about, it said that there was a missing file (that, or it could not access it).  The file was a Picture It ""dll"" file.  When we ran all 7 discs through ""find file"" command, no such file could be found either.  We consulted the Microsoft customer service, and we uninstalled and reinstalled many times using different techniques that were told to us by Microsoft customer service people.  The problems didn't go away, and even created more problems. Sometimes, even when we were only sending an e-mail, we'd get a pop-up message that said we needed to put the Picture It disc in the drive (really strange!).  On one other installation, the image icons would not appear.  Eventually, we returned the software to [the store], and then bought another Picture It, hoping that maybe we had a bad box the first time.  The second Picture It box we bought had the same problems.  We tried installing on our other computers (we have four computers in the house), but the same problem existed.  We returned the second box, and we don't intend to buy a third.  Good luck with it if you buy one!!!"
it is very accurate and flexible program to design home. There are many textures and decoration stuff. you can make wonderful  pictures.
"I've been using SiteSpinner since 2009 and SiteSpinner Pro for the last two years.  I have used it to build sites for several small businesses and three nonprofits.  All clients have been delighted with their Web sites and this software made it easy for me to build what they wanted.  I have a background in design and editing but no experience whatsoever with coding. If it hadn't been for SiteSpinner I would have lost this aspect of my business.  The software is very easy to learn: the help menu and online tutorials make it a snap!  A couple of times, my clients have wanted something out-of-the-ordinary included in their site. Each time I resorted to the online community and received immediate and helpful guidance. And it comes in from all over the world!  This is a very popular program. This is the best investment I could have made in my business.  I love it!

"I just purchased Print Shop 3.5 (DVD) at Sam's Club.  There are two dvd's.  DVD #1 installed perfectly.  The second dvd would not install.  I tried to install it on 3 computers, (2) were Windows 8.1, the third one is Vista.  After selecting ""Install"", the dvd just makes thumping noises, and never installs.  I assumed there was something wrong with the dvd, so I took it back to Sam's Club, and they exchanged it.  I experienced the exact same problem with the new dvd.  I sent  trouble ticket to Broderbund a week ago, but no response yet.  Does anyone know where I can purchase a competitor's print program that works?  Willard"
I have used the ProSeries product (the professional version of TurboTax) for several years and tried TurboTax this year. My biggest complaint is that the product is difficult to navigate around because you can only go to the forms or the interview screens. It's a pain to go back and change something because you have to go through the entire interview from the beginning.
"Terrible, this is  trail software and is very very limited in scope.  I didn't realize it was trail software when I purchased it because it does not seems to say that anywhere in the product description."
"I'm still using, so far so good thanks"
"There are of course other utilities out there for Windows which do the same thing.
However you can run into trouble with those other utilities, for example:
In certain versions of other software, bugs are found that will truncate the filename on extremely long filenames.  For example in certain versions of an unnamed but popularly available compression utility, the length of a file name can adversely effect the extraction process. If the total number of characters in the directory path (i.e. c:\documents and settings\user\...) and the filename (i.e. testfile.txt) exceed 260 characters, the archive will not extract correctly, and the filename will be truncated.

While those other utilities are viable for home use, I prefer to use WinZip in Business environments."
Download will not work.  Cannot get any mic to work with this program.  Instructions are vague and multi-step downloads of unrelated programs and most instructions refer to mobile operating systems iOS or Android but download was for the Windows version.  Total waste of $100.
"We bought this for our laptop as we had used trend 2012 and had no problems.  When you buy anti-virus software you expect it to do just that, not corrupt your computer!  Slowed our computer down to a crawl (actually an understatement) and used all of our memory.  We took our laptop in to repair it and we were told that it was this program that did it.  He also said it took him over 90 minutes just to uninstall.  There are plenty of free programs for anti-virus that are out there and recommended!"
"Good product, but unfortunatly they find a way to make upgrade every two or three years whether you need too or not.  I was happy with my orginal copy ofQB 2003.  Corrently I'm on my 4th version."
"I attempted twice to uninstall and reinstall Kindle for PC and while the program will initially launch it will soon after (maybe after 2-3 seconds) display a text box stating ""Kindle has stopped working"". I'm not sure if the program is having compatibility issues with Windows 7 or if the software itself is not functioning. I've no doubt the software would work perfectly if only I could access my paid for content! Please update your application Amazon.."
"Very nice software which enables you to get the shot that your eye sees but the camera can't capture. I have iPhoto, Aperture, Adobe Elements 9, and Lightroom 3 which are all very good products but none have the capability of Photomatix. You can even push the envelope and get some rather gaudy but interesting photos. It isn't intuitive however, and the booklet that comes with it is limited so I would recommend getting a more comprehensive book. Even then, it will take a good deal of work to get what you want. If your camera has the auto aperture bracketing setting, it will simplify things. Mine will only bracket for three shots but it is recommended to have five or more. You can cheat by setting your camera to multi shots (I use seven) and let the software change the aperture settings for you. Photmatix is not an album storage so you have to store the altered shots in another software location which may require you to download that capability from the Photomatix web site. The web site includes tutorials."
I work on Windows 7 computers all day at work in IT support. Great operating system with many useful and neat features. Never pay over $100 as it is always on sale.
"Bought it to clean up a computer that had hard to remove adware. Norton couldn't find it, but constantly had a pop up window alerting me to a large amount of outbound traffic. Norton failed to tell me what program that the large traffic was referring to. Ended up downloading some free adware removal programs which cleaned up the computer better than Norton...sad."
I have Windows 7 and for some reason it is telling me the software cannot be installed on my computer after I have purchased it. Indicates that I don't have an additional service pack needed for installation... Total waste of my money!!!
"The software does what it is supposed to do and is pretty intuitive to use. However, they charge you so much if you want to do another state filing and another $20 bucks for e-filing. But, then it is their business...isn't it!!"
Excelent!!
"I purchased this product for my son with Asperger's syndrome, in an effort to find something as visual as possible to help him with math.  The software froze almost immediately.  My relatively tech-savvie husband went through the process of getting help fixing this software.  The web site contact emailed him twice with help using some sort of ""patch"".  A ""patch""?  Are you kidding?  Why don't you just fix the software so that it works out of the box?  The first application of the patch didn't work.  The second application DID work, but now I am looking at the software more critically.  The tutorial is relatively good, and the avatars are nice and will appeal to children.  The activities on the 2nd CD are AWFUL -- very primitive!  A child would get bored quickly with the activities and would not find them challenging.

Don't even bother . . ."
"Transition was easy, although I had to re-enter all of my credentials for online accounts.  I like the new Bill Reminders screen better than the old and the new category summaries.

They still need a better way to flag when an automatic has occurred because this program still matches incorrectly and then I miss the reminder that was matched incorrectly (old program had the same issue)."
"As always Turbo Tax makes tax preparation quick and easy. By saving files from the previous year it just transfers information about us right in and we can just add the tax info from this year and we're finished within a few hours. It is very thorough at finding deductions you're eligible for to save you money.
I would recommend this program to anyone that has a small business and is unsure about deductions and credits."
Works good. Hard to put on windows 8
"I have used Paperport for the past 3 or 4 versions.  Paperport 11 is improved but still the slowest application on my hard drive.

In particular displaying thumbnails of files in a folder seems to take from a minute to several minutes to accomplish.

Also scanning with my Epson 3170 scanner appears to be problematic; whenever I hit the scan button and do not wait until the scanner's light stops flashing, I will get an error.  I then cancel out the scanning dialog and start over.  Usually I will be granted a scan.

Overall, I like the program to help organize all my important documents, but I do not like the fact that almost every operation is slow.

By the way my computer should not be the problem; I'm running a new AMD 64 x 2 4400+ processor with 2 GB of RAM.  Every other program I have is zippy except for Paperport 11."
"Supposed to be a 1 year purchase but it no longer works, it  starts up and a banner says it has expired do I want to purchase?
I purchased this 12-10-2014 and today is 5-11-2015."
I thought it was gonna be a disk...I'm having a hard time to find the right web page to download the protection. The one on the paperwork is wrong. Totally disappointed and 3 weeks later I still haven't downloaded it.
"This is worst piece of design software I can imagine.  It is obvious that whoever created it had never done architectural drawing, or drafting, for that matter.  Have you ever seen a set of working drawings for building a house that showed dimensions of the building from center of wall to center of wall??  No, in 40 plus years as a general contractor I haven't either.  When you print a design ""to scale"" at 1/4"" = 1' you expect that when you place a ruler on the print 1 inch will equal 4 feet.  Not with this piece of garbage.  Do not waste your money."
"The program kept referring to a book?  The book was not included, and not to be found.  I got this as a gift years ago FULL PRICE higher than shows now."
"This is my first time ever purchasing a downloadable software from Amazon or online in general. I downloaded this in 03.2013. I use this for general business needs, and use all three programs regularly.

This may not be 100% full featured as the Windows version but so far for all of my needs, it has fit the bill. And I do use it fairly extensively to manage a variety of different things for a small business. I find it easy to use and the transition between Windows/Mac for files has been seamless and errorless for the first month. Overall, I am happy, I got what I expected from the software package and it only took 15m to download, then another 2-3 to set up (wi-fi).

Very happy with the software and the download/set-up process."
"Amazon transaction was smooth, quick, simple, and inexpensive.  A+ for Amazon
I noticed more issues with the intuit product this year, even simple things were wrong.  D+ for Intuit this may well be the last year I use them

After e-filing my federal taxes, my refund is in limbo approaching 3 weeks and Intuit is imposible to contact.  Stock answers that are out of date, no responses to queries, multi-hour waits.  Many people have the same issue and are just as frustrated as I am.

Also found issues with mishandling college students as dependents (501)"
Excellent app
"To build a slide show 'movie' this product is easy, feature rich, and quite intuitive. Video clips are easily included but can only be shortened as desired (nothing fancy but adequate). The problem comes when trying to burn your 'show' to DVD. It will not play on any player I use (Sony and Panasonic). There is absolutely NO SUPPORT from NCH unless you've prepaid for it. After many frustrating attempts to resolve the 'burning' issue I've resorted to saving my 'show' as a data file then sending it to a Roxio product I have and that works. If you already own this software try to send the saved file to another DVD Burn program. Otherwise, there is probably much better slideshow software out there."
It works great and cheaper that buying the same thing at an office supply store. Thank you for offering such great buys.
"Ordered this due to so performance trouble I was having with my lap top.  Loaded without any problems.  Fixed several problems i did not even know I had.  One of my biggest issues with my computer was internet problems,  So far this product has not helped much in this area.  My adobe flash stops work many times while on Facebook placing farmville.  Might be the the game or Facebook that I am having the issues with, product is still worth the money."
Great for navigating the roads in Italy.
"Let me first say that fhe idea with this program is great. Both professionals and amateurs will find it useful as a practice tool. However ...

I bought BIB first time 2012 and my original review can be found here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R122W54PEHH5FC/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006MBZXJO&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=229534&store=software

I had hoped that at least some of the core of my complaints/wishes should have been addressed and rewritten three years late but to my disappointment most of my original critique is still valid. Yes there have been some minor clean up in the UI but not the complete rewrite it really requires. The UI is still extremely bad. The target audience are professional and amateur (me) musicians and as such we know music but the idiosyncrasies of the UI forces me to spend more time on the UI than on the music. Given that I am a professional software developer since the last 30 years who have worked with a lot of bad tools with even worse UIs its quite a big feat to have me upset by a UI (of course adding icons that looks like designed by a kid doesn't help)

Unfortunately there are, to the best of my knowledge, no alternatives so we are stuck with a program + UI that seems more designed by a hobbyist twenty years ago rather than a professional software company in 2015. This is the only reason for three stars. With a single viable alternative it would be one star.

Pros:
- Using the realtracks with the right settings can produce fairly to very good backup/band sound
- Great for practicing mechanical timing, much more fun and effective  than a metronome
- The only program in its genre
- The core program is fairly priced (but keep in mind you need to invest in a number of real-track packs to really be able to get good sound so you probably have to double the initial cost, depending on what kind of variety you need/want)

Cons:
- Bad , bad , bad UI. BTW did I mention the horribly UI?
- Manages to avoid every single de-facto standard UI-pattern in Windows (and Mac) so nothing is were you reasonable can expect it
- Expect to invest heavily in learning the program (weeks rather than days)
- Confusing docs written like a really dense text book and difficult to use as a reference. Also the layout and typography of the docs indicates to me that this was not written by a professional + the use of music slang rather than proper music terms makes it far less than optimal.
- I experienced a few program crashes with some cryptic error messages which again indicates a lot of legacy code with error messages looking like early VB windows messages.

Unfortunately, the last three years lack of real progress, as far as I can judge, the market material indicates a lot of improvements but to the naked eye and daily use there is very few changes apart from some minor UI-cleanups. Perhaps more advanced users can spot the improvements. From this I'm forced to draw the conclusion that the company does not have the competency or the financing it takes to bring this program into this millennium and instead are forced to make only minor improvements (to justify a new version and bring in revenues - which I can understand from a business point of view). The program has what is known development circles as a intractable technical debt that sadly will never be paid. A pity, since the whole idea with the program is absolutely great. Just poorly executed.

Edit: Spelling"
"My daughter who is 5 received it for Christmas. She played it twice and lost interest. Then couple days later she picked it up again and started playing. Now it's her favorite game. She plays it almost everyday and she loves it. I'm surprised how much she's learned from that game. It's very fun and learning, she said she wished they made Brave 2, well who knows."
"The Wall Street Journal is a very popular publication, and therefore you would think they would allow cancellations another way besides phone calls. It is 2016, and WSJ doesn't allow changes to be made to your subscription service (or at least to get a less expensive subscription option) any way besides a phone call with a live worker.

I appreciate the dedication to personal interactions, but my goodness, modernize a little bit. I ordered a trial subscription back in February, created an account for the day, and forgot about it. Without verifying my email or any notification I would charged, or any receipt of charge I was charged more than $150 over four months. Was it my bad for not verifying my account and cancelling? Maybe, but WSJ is not interested in their readers opinions, reviews, time, or convenience.

I will say, the writing is fantastic, though."

"The claims that this software is of equal quality to Rosetta Stone are just ludicrous. The software is comparable only in that it aims for the same goal: teaching people a new language. The method is where Rosetta Stone shines, and it is in the method where the two programs quickly diverge. Where Rosetta Stone tries to mimic the natural process of language acquisition as closely as possible, Instant Immersion feels like a classroom on my computer.

Additionally:
- The graphics are sub-par, which isn't that big a deal.
- What is a big deal however is that the Who is Oscar Lake? CD requires that I have Rosetta installed on my Mac. It's been years since I've had to run anything using Rosetta and is just an instance of how far behind the times this software is.
- As another reviewer noted, this software is all made to run directly from the disc, not installed on the hard drive. This is unfortunate for a couple reasons:
  * the software runs slower as reading from a disc is more time intensive than reading from the hard drive
  * it is a significant drain on the battery

After using the software, the DVD, and the MP3 tracks, I see why Instant Immersion costs 90% less than Rosetta Stone and would happily pay the higher price for a higher quality product."
"Don't over-pay for Turbo-Tax. After using Turbo Tax for years, I decided not to pay the excessive amount that was asked for the level I needed, and found that H&R Block was a lot less expensive. And, get this, it found deductions that Turbo Tax missed for years!"
Great price and most importantly the serial number worked. I would do it again in a heartbeat. Sometimes old software can be risky.
"The disk functioned in a modern operating system, windows 7 64 bit, and was everything I remembered it to be.  The seller sent me the product quickly and I have thoroughly enjoyed it."

"I am a linguist and have purchased six of Rosetta Stone's language programmes. I have found them to be excellent supplemental tools in aquiring foreign languages. Without translations, your mind is forced to rely upon context (visual and verbal) to extract meaning. The repetive phrases ranging from one or two words to an entire paragraph engrain a syntactical map of how sentence structures are fabricated. I found that the more you work these lessons, the better they work for you. Repeating the phrases out loud each time after the speaker is much more powerful than simply listening.

The Latin speakers on this product render an excellent restored Classical Latin accent; the /r/'s are trilled (unlike the liquid English /r/ produced in some other Latin softwares) and the vowels are crisp and distinguished. The lessons provide enough exercises and variations to keep one occupied for a substantial length of time. Any Latin student that dedicates one or two extra hours daily to this programme in addition to their regular Latin homework will no doubt be head of the class.

My only gripes are that the pictures are lower quality than other Rosetta Stone programmes; they are small and have low resolution. And there is just one level with which one can only achieve a high-basic skill level at best upon completion."
"I purchased Quicken 2007 for Mac.  I have tried to reconcile 2 different checking Accounts and found that some items that were ""checked"" as being reconciled do not appear with an ""R"" when the Check Register is printed.  These items were definitely checked in the Register,

I am not confident that these items will show up in future reconciliations of the (two Accounts).

What can be done to correct this situation??"
I love that I can just download it and not have to wait for it to be mailed to me.

"I have used the older version of Calendar Creator since it came out. It was GREAT!!! Of course, it no longer works with windows7, so I had to buy an updated version. I worried that with ""improvements"" it would be worse. I was right. It seems like it is PRETTIER (you have more choices for art, colors, fonts, etc.) but less functional. I cannot modify margins within days, I cannot view the week with smaller weekend blocks (the first version even did that.) and some other things. For example listing more than 5 or 6 events in one day pushes them off the bottom (due to unchangable spacing between lines), I could fit them on my old calendar program by choosing ""small"". Now, if I try to make the font smaller, it ~could~ work, but there is no way to hit ""enter"" within the event, so it is one continuous block of text. Try lining THAT up using the space bar!) There used to be commands (like &line) which no longer exist.

I realize my needs aren't exactly the same as someone elses. I USED to like that so much of the basics were modifiable with the old program. This one is too ""template-y""...there are just not enough things for me to be able to modify. I mean...i don't really care if I can change the shadow under something. I use the calendar to view events efficiently...not so much to be pretty.  I mean, templates and pre-designed things are great...but give me a choice to NOT use them if I want.

A better program would have pre-designed choices AND a blank page that still accessed a calendar (for repeating events) where you could make days any size you want...and make the event box like a REAL text box (where you could bold or underline partial text, etc.) Say for example, you work wednesdays through fridays, maybe you would like those days wider on your calendar to accommodate more text. OR if you have 15 things to do on one day, you should be able to view and print that (even if it is small) not just click some arrow on your computer. This isn't that kind program.  :(

I wanted to like this. I even would live with a few changes...but it now reminds me of one of those greeting-card type programs where it there are boxes like ""click here to add a picture"" and ""click here to type your message of 25 characters or less."" I shall keep looking. I dislike outlook (and most microsoft products) for the same reason (too pre-formatted.) I do like Corel Wordperfect...maybe they have a calendar..."
"Many of us have been disappointed and genuinely angry about Windows Vista: it has useless features, complexities and problems that make its use more than a problem. The reaction has ranged from ""can I return this to the manufacturer"" to passive frustration in near silence and now to ""there's a solution out there called Windows 7... and it could not be worse than Vista... and maybe it's better"".

Many of us also pay for extended warranty protection and both hardware and software support. I am one of those buyers who has tended to pay extra amounts up front to ""protect my investment"" and hopefully make the use of my laptops less difficult and more problem free, knowing that the up front cost can be steep and ""problem free"" a rare and temporary state of affairs.

This is the case with a Dell laptop (Model XPS M1530) I purchased in the last year and for which paid the substantial additional cost of a supplemental warranty and service contract extending through 2011 for the laptop/hardware, software and the extended support. Last week I finally decided after considerable deliberation to purchase Windows 7 and through Dell's live on-line service communicated with an engineering service representative who was more than delighted to sell me the Windows 7 package, which comes in various ""strengths"" and hence at various price points.

I had done some homework on the Microsoft website which had what appeared to be slightly lower costs but made the decision to buy from Dell keeping my purchases within the ""sphere"" of Dell and its contractual performance obligations. The Dell sales person told me to contact Dell when I received the discs and that they would help me to install the ""custom"" version of the software. When I attempted to seek their help several days later they informed me that their ""help"" on installation would cost me $129 per hour, which was not disclosed up front.

Even worse Dell has subsequently informed that because I purchased the software from ""Dell Retail"", a ""separate company"" my warranty coverage on the laptop's operating system is no longer in effect and that I must now pay $129 per hour for support relating to software problems... a loss of warranty and a cost that was never disclosed to me. So not only did I lose value from the original extended service contract but I paid $340 for the Windows 7 software that will now cause me to pay service fees I was never informed of.

I put all this out there as a warning to those who may be confronting the same decision. Dell's lack of disclosure may well violate Massachusetts Consumer Protection laws as well as those in New York and California. Even if it does not constitute violation of any laws it demonstrates a ""way of doing business"" that is deplorable, disgusting and foul. Many of us don't mind paying additional sums for good perforamnce and service but we do not like material information withheld from us an any point especially when we are making a purchase decision.

The Dell people have referred to this outcome as their ""company policy""."
Save yor money.  This is junk.  Do not buy.  It's impossible to learn.  I tried for about 8 hours and got so frustrated that I threw it away!
Office Mac download was simple and relatively fast.  I was pleasantly surprised that all went without a glitch and the cost was very reasonable.
"Thanks to Amazon ... its awesome offer. My friend suggested that every year Amazon provides this excellent sales promotion. Finally i got it this year. I like this product please find comparison link ... mcafee total protection has lot of features ...

"Not exactly what I needed but it was my fault. Great program other than that
."
"Good software. Kinda stuck now with what Quicken offers since MS Money is about to become extinct. Works pretty good in all areas except bond and government backed (Ginny Mae, etc>) investments. For example -- doesn't adjust your bond holding based on the return of capital."
So far I found everything I want and more. Great for both computer and mobile. The mobile app losed albums selected prior when re-opened. Not to impressed with that lack of saving what albums I was in the middle of playing and then having to search again.
great buy
"I've done my taxes for the last 4 years or so with Turbo Tax, and it always helps me through things I don't understand. It carries info over year-to-year so that the basics don't have to be filled out each time, and checks for accuracy on all the forms in case something doesn't translate quite right.

The only knock against it I'd make is that it can be somewhat difficult to tell which version to buy for certain tax situations, but that likely doesn't apply to everyone."
Wife Loved It...
I feel blessed to have gotten this for under $30.  I am an old school lawyer and all my docs are in Word Perfect up until 7 years ago.  I lost the discs for the old Word Perfect and refused to spend a lot for a new set.  Which meant that I had no real convenient way of accessing the old files. Then in comes this wonderful deal.  This is more high tech than the last one I  have.  It merges my WordPerfect docs seamlessly with my Word docs.  The conversion makes it easy to work between both systems and allow me to access and use the older docs.  A blessing indeed.
Work perfectly!
I have used Quicken to process my personal taxes for 20 years.  It makes doing your taxes easy and painless.
Timely Delivery and as advertised.
"If you are already an Access user, you will find that Access 2010 simplifies many tasks.  Unfortunately, it's a little harder to find things because they are not where you are used to having them.  ;)"
A very good low cost photo software program for most amateurs.  I myself am satisfied with this version which I got at a very good price.
I'm yet another former TurboTax user who has switched. Haven't used the program yet but it would have to be unexpectedly bad to get me to consider TurboTax again. Feature list looks fine.
"Love the program but it's so buggy it's not even funny. Running scripts, I have to reinstall every few days. I have ample resources to run this program and I am using the 64 bit version. This makes no sense. Unless the update screwed it up ..."
"I originally purchased the Cook'n program to replace an old cooking software program, Gourmet Cooking as that program would not work on Windows 7 or 8. The Cook'n program has proven to be just what I was looking for. I am 76 years old and enjoy cooking and used to have lots of cookbooks, probably 35 to 40. I now use only the Cook'n program and use it to research and develop my own computer recipe files. I started collecting computer recipe files in the early days on Food Network TV and I still have lots of floppy disks with the Food Network Chefs recipes. In those days you could send Food Network 1 dollar and they would mail you a copy of a selected recipe or you could download it for free which I did but they were not organized. I subscribed to Bon Appetite from day one of their publication and also such magazines such as Southern Living. I found that cookbooks and magazines were bulky and difficult to use, Cook'n solved this issue. I now have purchased 7 copies of the Cook'n program and have given them as gifts to friends and relatives. The program specifications does not show Windows 8 as being compatible but I use Windows 8 and it works fine. I would surely recommend this to anyone looking for a way to access, download and organize and print recipes."
"Got half way through my return and when I tried to enter business income Turbo tax informed me that I had to purchase additional software for business income and expense. Since I have been using Turbo tax Deluxe since 2006 for my business, I called Intuit to register a complaint..

The party I spoke to at Intuit apologized for the inconvenience and upgraded my software immediately, and at no charge. I later received an email apology from Sasan Goodzari.

At this point everything seems O.K., but I am still a little disappointed that I had to complain to get the situation resolved."
I had a computer that would not boot up and purchased this worked several hours trying to get this to work and it would not boot up my computer I ended up reloading the original operating system back on it.
"I use it every year for some pretty complex taxes -- rental properties, oil pipeline Schedule K-2s, and my wife's small business."
"I just upgraded from QB 2005 to QB 2009 and it's taken me a day to get the setting tweaked to how I'm used to it.  So far I haven't found any new functionality that's very exciting, and the program seems to run slower than the 2005 version.

But one thing that was driving me crazy was the pop up ads for setting up an Intuit account, or other ads that would pop up on opening.  I just figured out where to disable this.  Go to Edit/Preferences/General/My Preferences tab and check the box that says ""Turn off pop-up messages for products and services."""

Good overview of what Kindle Unlimited can and can't do.  The book is quite readable and arranged well.  Glad I checked it out.
I love this product.  It installs as a background utility so once it is installed you never have to think about it again.  Now I can bring large video files back and forth between clients that work on windows or mac.  If you need to write files larger than 5gigs and they need to be acessed on a drive that must be used by mac and windows you need this.
"There is no way of escaping a learning curve with capable design software, and this is no exception. It not only requires time to learn the tools but also requires a mental transition from drafting concepts to CAD concepts. It is a sub-set of Chief Architect, a professional CAD program.
The software would benefit enormously from dual-monitor support as well as some conventional drafting capability. For the price, it's pretty good."
"If you are looking to file your taxes and get a refund in the next month, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!  We bought this because it was cheaper than Turbotax...I have always used Turbotax for our taxes (still love it more than this one for sure) but this year decided to save some money and see if Taxcut was equal.  It is NOT!  ""You get what you pay for"" keeps ringing in my head.  They should not be allowed to sell this software without telling you that most of the correct tax forms are not available for the product yet!!!  We purchased it 2 weeks ago, did our taxes and discovered on screen that all of the forms would be updated around 01/16/05.  We're talking 1040 and all of its schedules...according to the list of forms that needed updating, it was ALL of them.  Fine, no biggie...but I went to try to finish our taxes yesterday and it popped up the warning during the review phase that the non-cash charitable contribution form would not be updated until mid February.  Sorry, H&R Block/Taxcut...I'm doing my taxes at Taxact.com this year.  Check it out BEFORE you purchase this box of useless software."
Product performed as advertised
"I was sent a sealed box with DVD/CD as promised. The disc, too, was sealed in its envelope. When I put the disc in the player, the little circle that appears periodically on the computer screen when something is loading turned and turned for 20 minutes and didn't load. I removed the disc, and tried again. I let the circle spin for one hour without anything further happening (other than the single message that Bidefender was loading). Assuming it was now in eternal spin, I removed the disc and looked at it. The disc had scrapes, scratches, and FINGERPRINTS on it. It was also a BURNED disc, not an original. This was obviously a copied, defective disc that was repackaged and sold as new. I returned it and will never buy from this company again. I don't think the amazon seller is to blame (after all, it was sealed) but do blame Bitdefender for packaging this piece of garbage and selling it as new.

One more thing: it damaged the hard drive. Happily, one of Microsoft's apps was able to fix it.

So buyer beware. If you order a disc, look at it before loading. The software was recommended to me, so I was very disappointed and disturbed by this experience."
"Love it, very easy"
good
"Installation takes a good while but is not difficult, and the software itself is not too difficult to use. The more powerful the computer, the better - we used a high-end gaming laptop. If you want to work with MP4s, you need to buy an additional codec."
Awesome!
"I uninstalled it after only a few days, because it slowed me computer down terribly bad.
Now I'm back with McAfee, not free but very reasonable for me at amazon."
"Does the job, arrived on time, price was right, fuse was included,quality looks real good... would recommend it and buy it again."
"I already knew much of what this book taught, but needed it for a class. I thought this book was very thorough. Beginners can learn most of the basics. I learned quite a few new things too! And it's step by step, so you can go at your own pace. That is definitely a plus!  :)"
"This used to be a great program. The user interface wasn't the best and it was missing some minor components (like mail merge) but you could save or create text documents, spreadsheets or presentations in any of the MS Office formats. Not bad for free software! But with the 2015 version they pulled a TurboTax and now require you to pay for the ability to do this after 30 days. So don't mess with this one. I'd rather pay 20 extra bucks and get full-fledged Microsoft Office as this mess."

"Chocolatier is one of the few games that I enjoyed enough as a trial version to actually buy the full version. Quirky, funny, engaging, and entertaining, it's quickly dislodging the Diner Dash series from the latter's place as ""light game of choice"" in the house. ^_^"
Its great
Microsoft sucks .....  end of story.
"I assume it's working. If nothing else, I feel assured."
"IF you are a Quicken user then I would expect that you would like this product very well. I am coming from Microsoft Money Premium, and thus, have found the product not as much to my liking in comparison, but now there is no other option. This version ""Rental Property Manager"" appears to be Quicken's most comprehensive version having all the features of the other versions (a strange name for the ""top of the line"" version)."" However, I was interested in the most comprehensive version and thus bought the Rental Property Manager at twice the cost of the Microsoft Money Premium that I used prior. To be totally fair, I'm sure this is a fine product, but, for some of us that used the Money product, there is a clear separation, especially, using it as an ""investment management"" tool along with some other financial tracking features. It seems a bit more ""basic"" in its presentation, graphic, and financial analysis structure, more like a variation built on Microsoft Excel. I chose not to use the automatic conversion process due to other comments. I am reloading the data manually so as not to create any ongoing issues due to data conversion, Note: I did not use this type of software for electronic banking prior so that was/is not my objective, which, is more of its first line intent. I couldn't get to a live person to resolve initial questions, had to email, then got back a response, then you can set an appointment to talk with a customer service representative on a scheduled event. Like many things in life, sometimes what might be the better product does not win in the world of ""marketing and sales"" but we must all adjust, use what is available to us, or at some point someone will be driven to create a better product. Quicken as a ""name,"" has certainly produced some very popular programs, and many consumers are very happy with their products. I'd prefer MS Money if I could have it, but I'll readjust and move on since that is the option available currently. It's very much a matter of ""transitioning"" and that is not always comfortable or preferable when it is not on our timing. Buy some version of Quicken if you need this type of product. If you haven't used any other software in the past then I am confident you will be happy with the product."
I have had norton for 10 years and it has always worked for me. I always buy a new copy when it runs out because I run 2 computers and it is cheaper then renewal costs

"Can't See Visuals -- This is the only problem, and for me, it's a whopper: The gray font on a black background makes it virtually impossible to navigate, making the program useless. Other than that. it's fine."
"I've used Quicken before and went looking for a more recent program.  When I first installed it, I was disappointed because I had trouble getting to where I wanted to be.  I did not want to do all accounting on line with financial businesses; I just wanted to keep my own account..  Now that I have found how to do that and have used it for about two weeks, I am happy."

"What can I say, NO  commercials! NONE. No dumb DJ's. I get my traffic updates from Waze! Just music plain and simple and clear and no extra bill at the end of the month.

I use Parallels Desktop to run Windows 10 on my Macbook and it works perfectly.
"The product did not work with my system.
I don't know if I can return it."
"This is my second try.  The software is great, it is easy to use, but it has one defect.  The unit overheats and cannot make it through a 2 hr tape.  After about 30 minutes, the picture just stops (but the tape is still running).  After a bit it cools enough and then the transfer continues.  Finally, you just stop trying to record.  If you stop, then the disk finalizes.  Throw away another DVD.  It works fine for the first 30, maybe even 45 minutes.  The unit is then VERY hot and the trouble begins.  Sorry guys.  I think I'll take this one apart and see if works without the tight enclosure.  NEXT DAY:  I cut the unit open and I was able to make a 1Hr 45 min DVD of Japanese program RAN.  The unit works fine when it is able to keep the excess heat in control.  Make a vented enclosure and it should be OK.  Then it is worth 5 stars."
ALL GOOD
"I have an Echo and a Tap. I love being able to just say what I want to hear and it's usually pretty good about finding what I asked for. The variety of music is amazing. I'm an old ""folkie"" from the late 50's forward, so I love that the Weavers, Holly Near, etc.,  I also set aside Sunday afternoons for either listening to Broadway cast albums (or streaming tv shows, usually on Acorn TV). The Echo is a very decent speaker for cost and size."
The choice for music are endless.
I am happy with that I bought a used edition of National Geographic (outdated by ~8 years). The price and delivery were right and the disks worked as expected.
As advertised. Great price
"After using Quicken for many years, I got fed up with their poor customer service, forced paid upgrades, and less than stellar updates and started looking around at alternatives.  After trying a few other software products, I went with Moneydance and haven't looked back!

Moneydance has an intuitive user interface, powerful home page area that gives me a quick overview of my finances and budget, reminders so I don't forget payments, online banking and bill pay, and a number of powerful graphs and reports.  It also has a mobile app that I can use on my iPhone for quickly entering transactions while I'm out, which syncs effortlessly over Dropbox wherever I am. So awesome!

I did run into a small hiccup when initially configuring it and couldn't get the Dropbox syncing to work, so I emailed their support.  They replied to me quickly and got me up and running with it in just a couple of emails!  It was also quite clear that they were actually reading my messages and were native english speakers, unlike a lot of other tech support services today where you get someone reading a script who may or may not know any more english than the script that they're reading from.  Great support!

I also like that it's cross platform and works on Macs and PCs.  I'm a Windows guy, but my wife loves her Mac and not only are we able to share the same data file on both computers, the license lets us use Moneydance on as many computers as we have in our household!  Most licenses are tied to one computer these days, but a Moneydance license covers all the computers in your household--very convenient.

All in all, I'm quite happy with my purchase."
"I couldn't get the trial version to work and I contacted customer support.  They were so helpful.  If you are running Windows 10 with Edge, you have to do a couple of things before it will import recipes from the internet.  Once they helped me figure out the problem and fix it, I went ahead and bought the program.  It makes cookbooks the way you want to, and copies a recipe so easily.  I love the program."
I have used the system for 21 years.  It works well for me even as a guy that has businesses.
"After using Quicken for Win for more than a decade the Mac version is disappointing. I have gotten used to it, after much effort, but I do not understand why it is missing some of the functionality. I think the Quicken team should be embarrassed about the difficulty of moving from Windows to Mac. I never did get it right. I highly recommend following the suggestion on the Quicken site but even then it is a painful process.

If you are starting from scratch on the Mac this version should be fine. I am becoming more accustomed to it. It certainly handles the basic checking and savings just fine. I miss the attachments function. My loan accounts did not port over. The reports are better in Windows. Some of the investment functionality seems to be missing, though my basic brokerage account works fine.

In the end this seems to be the only option for the Mac anyway so I guess the Quicken folks can be neglectful."
I really like this software it keep my finances and gives me in detail reports i would recomend this to everyone
"I like it, but did a little while to down load on my laptop."
It did not work on the version of 7 Windows like it said it would.
"I ordered this software program hoping that I would learn Spanish to supplement my teaching career.  Unfortunately, disk #1 did not work at all.  I followed the instructions how to download (included with the software) and neither of my two computers would start it. I even followed the ""auto play"" instructions included with the software, but alas, it would not start.  I tried other CDs on both of my computers to make sure it wasn't a computer problem and those CDs worked fine.  I tried the game disk, and it started, but there were no clear instructions how make the game GO and I gave up.  I sent this product back and will try a different program."
"I am learning Biblical Hebrew and it is a collosal task for somebody who never had anything to do with a semitic language. Thus listening to pronounciation and copying it by repeating after the teacher is really essential. Hebrew World has produced an astounding product which is a must for the beginner, for any student of Hebrew Biblical."
"I purchased this item because my computer person told me that I needed a common newer Quicken program to merge data on one computer that had been compiled with  2004 Quicken software with data on another that had been compiled with 2007 Quicken software.  He started to install it to upgrade the 2004 Quicken program with this 2010 Quicken program and the results were disasterous.  It left four of five affected accounts as they were, but chose to swing the fifth and most used one (which had about nine years of data in its history)about $20,000 on the debt side without any apparent understandable reason.  Even though the Intuit web site had some FAQs and reference to some blogs, there was no apparent way to contact someone at Intuit in what I considered an emergency (it was and is tax time).  It was all my computer person could do to reclaim the older Q Data, but I had to purchase 2004 Quicken software because I only recently disposed of the disc for the 2004 software that the 2010 program had overridden.  The replacement 2004 software is yet to arrive, and I have my fingers crossed.  As for the 2010 Quicken software, it had caused me great anxiety and was one of the worst experiences I have had with computer software.  I returned it to Amazon quickly and do not recommend its purchase for anyone who has already-established Quicken Q Data on his or her computer.  From my perspective, Amazon should stop selling it.  It was that bad."
This is a great program. It has all of the material you need to study in order to do well on the PCAT. The study guides and videos to help refresh the subjects is great. I've been out of school for a couple of years and it definitely gave me a  great review on things i've forgotten. I recommend this to anyone who needs to brush up on their subject material and get and get a view of how the test is.
My PC was running Win 7 32-bit and I was having some memory resource and speed issues when editing photos.  I added RAM (up to 8 gig from 4 gig) and upgraded the operating system to Win 7 64-bit.  The installation of Win 7 64-bit was simple and straight forward (much easier that previous operating systems put out by Microsoft).  I definitely have seen an improvement in the performance of my PC since the PC can now utilize all of the RAM (Window 7 32-bit could not utilize the full 4 gigs of RAM).
"I purchased the Fodor's review for my statewide travel around Oregon.  I'd hoped to find recommendations for the major cities, including the state capital.  However, only Portland is mentioned and the reviews failed to capture the essence of this city.

"This product came bundled with my digital camera.  I would not recommend that anyone purchase this product.  There is very little documentation provided.  The ""help"" function is not organized well and it is difficult to find answers to your  questions.  If you are new to digital photography, you will be frustrated with the program."
"It does not run in MS Windows 2000...
It does not run in MS Windows XP environment either...
... at least not without hours and hours of fiddling.

It WILL RUN on MAC with OS 9! YEAH!

Hubby and I were only willing to put in 4 hours (including looking at stupid online help) trying to get it to run on one of our Windows machines. The disk will launch but not install. This may or may not be due to our having more than one harddrive and CD player having letter ""F"" designation.

In any case, my advice is not to get the kids all excited and then sit down expecting a quick install while they are waiting... and waiting.

It did run on our MAC and it is an enjoyable program. In fact, I will go so far as to say that it is an EXCELLENT piece of learning software.

My advice, however, is to consider our difficulties in getting this 'older' software to run before you purchase. It might be better to wait for an updated version that will no doubt be out around Christmas time."
"The version I received was 5.5.6 which did not work properly on my iMac G5.  If this is the version you get, make sure you download the latest FREE update (currently 5.5.11) from Microspot. After the update MacDraft worked flawlessly.  Worth every penny!"
love that i can listen to what i want and where i want.
Excellent way to keep up with recipes!  This software is the best.
"Didn't come with instructions, key code nor will work with PC using duel core CPU or anything above win XP"
It is a really good movie for 12 year olds. I absolutely would watch! It is my favorite movie! You would love it.
"I used to use turbo tax, and it worked well for me. I purchased H&R when it was on sale, and I am happily surprised that H&R Block worked as well as Turbo Tax, and saved me tons of time. I recommend Home Deluxe if you trade stocks, bonds, or have mortgage..."
Works great and I use very often.
"PrintMaster 15 was a much stronger program.  With V6, I can't have more than one document open at a time, cut and paste from one PM doc to another, or see margins on the active document.  I feel like the program is 15 years behind PM 15!"
This is great and you have on your phone. So you can read or study anytime.
"i find encyclopedia britannica deluce 2011 a great source of information. it is easy to maneuver throughout the disc in search of data. regarding the dictionary, i would have liked audio included."
"Great job, love it!"
this is lousy.  One actor 'twitches' while the other one speaks very rapidly.  Worst of all THERE IS NO GUIDE BOOK OF ANY KIND.  Just stick in the CD and GOOD LUCK!
The Amazon version of this software does not come with the serial number required to use it.  It's been 25 minutes and I am still not able to log on.  Huge waste of time and money.
It is okay I have finally learn how to do certain things but other not yet I wish there were some instructions on how to reconcile the statements. I wish I could figure out how to set the budget info for starters. I just need a few pieces of information and I could be on my way. It is very different from a pic version and I had no idea what this version would be like
Easy to down load.
You can't find one for less.
I bought this for my daughter who practices her typing frequently. It makes learning to type a fun and entertaining exercise.
"Great !  It was recommended by my mechanic, and I trusted him !  luv it !"
"As many of the reviews of this product make plain, TurboTax changed their software packaging for the 2014 tax season, and no longer walk you through Schedules C and D in their Deluxe version, as they had been doing for many years.  Now, you have to purchase this Personal and Small Business version, at a higher price.  I've used TurboTax many times in the past, and have never had a problem with it, and the 2014 version is no exception.  It installed easily and ran smoothly on my old XP desktop, and did what I needed.
But, over the years I've used other tax preparation software, too, and haven't been unhappy with it.  I've used what used to be called Tax Cut several times, which is now H&R Block, and have had no problems.  H&R Block's Deluxe package includes federal and state returns and includes Schedules C and D, for half the price of TurboTax Personal and Small Business.  I haven't tried the 2014 version of H&R Block, but based on the reviews, using this version of TurboTax is throwing money away."

Personally I feel like you aren't getting what you pay for, but the importance of having the software registered to your email address is up to you.

The software itself works well on my system, and I like the interface better than PowerDVD, but I sort of feel like I was scammed by purchasing it here.

edit (Jan 2014): Others have reported they were able to enter their email address and register the software to it. I was not given this option when I purchased and installed the software. I did send a complaint to Amazon about it after I bought it, so they may have made changes since then to allow you to register it to your own email."
did not install at all
Rosetta stone does not own the rights to the Navajo version.  It is available through navajorenaissance.org with all profits going toward preserving the language.
"Well, I bought this product in the hopes that it would accurately fix the colors on my sony bravia lcd and it did not.  With the cost of this product, I would have not have purchased this if I knew how in accurate it would be.  I instead purchased the pantone display lt, much better calibrator, and the picture looks stunning."
"not working for mac, stuck on app updating then crashes"
"bought this for our trip this summer.  only used it the first few days, as the interface is awkward, the search is clunky, and it is inferior to the google maps app on my phone.  wish i hadn't wasted my money."
I LOVE KINDLE...I HAVE MANY BOOKS GOING AT ONE TIME AND ALWAYS HAVE THEM ON HAND WHEREVER I GO.
"I upgraded from Paperport 10 expecting to find improvements.  I use Windows 10, and in spite of running the connect to scanner program that's available on the user web site, the program simply freezes when I try to scan.  Added to that, 14 is not an improvement on 10 at all - several features of 10 are no longer available.  I have asked for my money back and will uninstall this program."
I would give 5 stars if there was a voice reader for ALL downloaded books. As alot of us spend multiple hours everyday commuting to and from work. Such a feature would allow us to replace the car radio with the books and stories of our choosing. Keep improving and I will stick with you.
"works as advertised, Tom Tom Home is very helpful in planning and downloading a trip route."
"I am very disappointed that Nuance Customer Service was unable to give me a way to run both of the versions I bought, Spanish and English. Otherwise, I am satisfied with the Spanish version."
"The product was awful.  It interfered with other software and froze up my internet access.  I canceled my subscription and then two months later, they billed me for a renewal, even after I had email confirmation that the renewal feature had been stopped.  I have yet to be able to get a response to my request for a resolution.  They (conveniently for them) only deal with billing issues by email, so you cannot speak to anyone directly."
Gave me license that was already used.
"As a new Mac user with a history of Office product use, I needed an easy way to migrate from the PC world.  I initially tried setting up a virtual PC on my Mac, but quickly discovered that I was importing all the PC/Windows headaches I wanted to escape.

I bought Mac Office, and have found that Word, Excel, and PowerPoint all work just like they should, and just like I'm used to, and I can freely copy all my old files over to the Mac.

I haven't yet successfully migrated my email functions.  I was a bit disappointed that I've got to learn Entourage, instead of Outlook.  It works easily enough, but moving my old emails is a task requiring some management and effort.  Since my old desktop has been running Eudora for email, I'm, still quite daunted by that migration effort."
I've been purchasing Norton for quite a few years. I consider it to be the best for my devices.
"I have used Home and Business TurboTax for several years and I think it is a wonderful tool for those who are self employed and even if you have multiple businesses.
The only problem I have run into is where to put my ministers housing allowance.  I have had to go online for help, and from what I have read it appears that this is a common problem.
I would have given the product 5 stars except that I have had the same problem for several years in a row."
I recently bought this card for my husband and a new hand held GPS.  We used it over the weekend of the 4th and found it to be very accurate.  I think I paid a fair price for this after pricing them at other places.
"Re learning a new system has always been a pain. 5 hours for down loading and data transfer was also a pain. I very much like the ""old"" method of loading from a disc."
"It's frequently offered as an Amazon Lightning Deal.  Got it for $35.  Doesn't offer much in the way of editing.  Never was able to cut video clips and save to separate files.  So never used it very much.  If you just want to do simple things, like adding graphics, it's OK.  Aside from its limitations, every time I put a disk into the PC that has any video file (I do this all the time with work-related video), the program starts up and takes over the screen.  I have to wait for the program to load and then immediately close it out.  I don't want to use this program for watching videos.  Something is in the registry that automatically starts up their program if any video file is detected on a disk.  Never was able to figure out a way to stop it from doing that.  Solved it by uninstalling their software.  Not surprisingly, the uninstallation process hijacked my screen (and thus my computer) for one final time. I love Corel Wordperfect (would never use any other word processor), but Corel VideoStudio is no Wordperfect."
"Access is one of my important programs and would be lost without it.  I was forced to 2010 after using the last license of my 2000.  As far as the 2010, I find that there have been substantial advancements from 2000.  However, most are not what I need, but is more in keeping with the other present Office programs.  The ribbon bar takes some getting use to in order to find ones way around.  I had the foresight to order Microsofts plain & simple tutorial which proved to be a big help although basically for what I use the program for there is not much change.  I am still using programs created with Access 97 with 2010.  Access is a powerful program capable of many things.  However, for me at 73 years and retired and using it for personal uses Id like to see a non commercial, less expensive version similar to the Offices Student and Home."
I have serif page plus and have found this product to be excellent. Now I have the DrawPluse X2 Studio and it is awesome. I have worked with PageMaker and Illustrator (which both are extremely expensive) and feel that Serif makes very affordable and awesome programs! Thank You!
Great game for the leapfrog explorer. Keeps my 4 yr olds attention and he seems to like it.
everything went great. thanks
They had a problem with their software for the 2014 taxes. I will never order this product again.  I did use it for several years before the problem.
"I have to admit that I come into this with a bit of bias, I have been a Mac user for over 20 years.  Now that Macs are able to run Windows on the same hardware I thought I would be worth it to give it a shot.

I can't say if this is an improvement as compared to previous versions of Windows, but what I can say is that from the short time I spent with this OS I would not be inclined to switch to Vista as my main operating system.  It has nice graphics and was not at all terribly difficult to install but it just isn't doing for me.

I'll be back in a few weeks with a more in depth review, but you know what they say, ""First impressions mean a lot."""
A lot of fun
"This is the best program on the market. It does everything it promises and more. You will love it as much as I do. I have tried pretty much all the programs on the market and I have found flaws with all of them. They just didn't do what I wanted. Maybe if I could roll them all together and they would have been perfect.  I figured it would be the same as all the others, it just wouldnt do everything I wanted it to do. I WAS SO WRONG!! This program is what I have been searching for all along.  I have tried to find things I didn't like about it. I have played with it for so many hours and days I probably do it in my sleep .Its super easy to use and the things it can do will blow you away! I could sit here for hours and tell you all the things that this program does and how I am impressed with it."
Great product and excellent services
"I currently have this case on my phone , I love the fact that the rubber covers the WHOLE phone and the hard part gives it that extra protection the case though is very hard to come off , there just seems there should be a tool that you use to take it off without almost breaking your nails other than that very nice case for price"
I started a complete backup at 10PM. The next morning at 6AM it had backed up on 29%. Wish I had read these reviews before I purchased it. Worst product I've ever bought.
"This is an excellent game and you too can get it running on your computer. Oregon Trail 5 should run on any version of Windows made in the past 20 years. The 5th edition is simply a modified version of Oregon Trail II. I've tested this on several computers without much trouble. 32 bit/64 bit, it doesn't matter.

You can play Oregon Trail without the CD which seems to correct a lot of the problems with install and running properly. I've created steps as detailed as possible below. Any average computer user should be able to follow these steps, just follow along one step at a time. I'm using quotes to help show what you're looking for, you do not type the quotes out at any point in this tutorial.

1. Open your hard drive so that you are viewing the root of drive C. Your desktop icon ""My Computer"" or ""Computer"" will take you there. Get to ""C:\"" or ""Local Disk C:""

2. Create a new folder and name it ""OT5"". That folder should now have a nice short directory address of C:\OT5. Open that new empty folder and leave that window up for now.

3. Start a new window to open the CD drive folder to view the contents of the Oregon Trail CD. This will typically be drive ""D:"" or ""E:"" on most computers. Do not run setup and do not install the game.

4. You should now be viewing the contents of your CD. Copy the folder called ""data"" on the CD and put it into your newly made OT5 folder on drive C. This will take a minute or so to copy over.

5. After the data folder finishes copying to C:\OT5, go back and view the contents of your CD again. Open the ""Install"" folder and then then ""HD"" folder on the CD. You should see 5 files.

6. Take the entire contents of the ""HD"" folder and copy it to the C:\OT5 folder as well.

7. You should now have 5 files and a data folder in C:\OT5. One of the files is labeled ""OREGON5"". Open this file. Notepad should open it for you. Look for the brackets that say ""[cdrom]""

8. Create a space under the [cdrom] title by hitting the return/enter key - add the text:  ""rsrcpath=C:\ot5\data""

9. This tells the game where to look for the data files. You should now be able to click on the ""OT5"" icon in your newly created folder and run the game properly.

10. No compatibly settings are needed as far as I can tell. You can play with those on the ""OT5"" icon properties menu/compatibility tab if you run into odd playback issues."
It is OK.  Does not pick up my on line bank statements very well.  Frustrating.  Otherwise it is all right.
"After reading the reviews on this website I purchased Resume Maker 7.0 and  installed the program on a Windows2K computer.  The installation of the  program is the only thing that has not given me problems. Though the  program has many excellant features, getting them to work properly has been  an exercise in patience. Even after getting the upgrades to V7.3 the  program still constantly crashes or changes the spacing/formatting of the  document I am working on. Text is dropped out of description cards with out  me knowing it, spaces and/or lines are inserted at the end of description  cards for no reason, and I could go on. This software has the potential to  be a great program, but in my opinion it is not quite ready for prime time."
Great Anti-virus and security software never had any issues.
"I am still quite new to the post processing world. I have been using Adobe Lightroom for some time. Since, I am not a professional photographer, I feel that the workflow process is too complicated. All I wanted was pick a photo that I want to keep and start manipulating it. Lightroom require me to import and export and do all kinds of things before saving my final picture results.

Corel AfterShot give me the flexibility and options it import the photos or just go straight to editing it. It provide many of the tools that Lightroom offers, or more. I think this software is definitely great for anyone who want to dip their toes in the post processing world. I would recommend it to my photographer friends with a heartbeat."
This game has really improved my bridge knowledge using different conventions and I love how you can replay the hand and learn how make your bid.
"Very quiet CPU heatsink but still it's ginormous, had to move one of my fans up a bit to let clearence for my RAM."
"I,ve been with Quicken since the beginning, this version is the worst, freeze's up all the time, not reliable at all."
"If you buy this version and then try to add a licensed version of outlook that is provided by your email provider, outlook will not work.  I just contacted Microsoft and it looks like despite the fact that you have a licensed version of Mac home office and a licensed version of Mac outlook, they do not work together and you need to upgrade to the Home/Business version for another $100, which is unbelievable."
"The start up is quick and the more you use it, the better it gets.  I am buying a second one for my son."
Great program for my Wacom Cintiq companion touch screen & very affordable!  If your making a comic then this will take you there.
Works good
Worked great.
This software never work for me because I can't get it installed. I tried to install it several times and it was stuck every time.
"Very easy to download. I cannot understand why people cannot make a Microsoft account, literally takes 5 minutes and complain about how slow it takes to download. Once you purchase the code, it takes 5 minutes to verify in your orders tab on Amazon. Then after it is down saying ""purchase verifying,"" you press ""Go to Your Software Library."" After you press it, press the ""Go to Office.com"" and it will ask you to make an account if you do not have one. If you do have an account, you just need to verify your info and it will automatically download after all that. This saved me about $19, better than paying $150 from the website or the store. Highly recommend buying this if you're trying to save money and want it instantly."
"It's amazing a company like Amazon can make such a poor software product like this.  Sync does not work across all platforms -- files will go missing randomly when syncing from various sources.  If Amazon really wants to be a competitor in the Cloud storage arena, it needs to take data a lot more seriously.

In its present state, I would avoid at all costs and search for alternative solutions.  As an IT professional, this product simply does not work well.

Come on Amazon -- step up your game.  You're better than this."
Had problems with the log-in process. Reverted back to my 2012 edition that doesn't require log-in NOT HAPPY!!
"I had used SM5 basic, but never really got the feeling that it was maintaining my machine. When it's tools did run as scheduled it basically sucked up my system resources and rendered my computer useless until the tasks were completed.

Bought SM6 Pro not too long ago. Initially it would hang while running certain maintenance jobs. Subsequent updates fixed this problem. Overall, I like the ease of use and it feels like the program is keeping my machine tuned up. However, it does so at the expense of performance. It takes programs noticeably longer to open and the tools are not customizable.

The undo function is completely inoperable and the only thing tech support could tell me about it (after contacting them twice and finally getting a reply almost three weeks later) was that they were looking into it and the problem might be fixed in future updates.

Another major problem is that the security program shuts my home network down. I cannot access my main computer from any other computer in the house. The only way to fix this problem is to completely restore my hard drive from a saved image file (or else completely reload the computer from scratch).

SM6 could be a great program. Many of the features and tools are valuable and run well, but the ones that don't wreak too much havoc. Overall, it slows your machine down, does not allow you to customize the way tools run, destroys your network and cannot undo changes it makes to your system.

Stay away from this product until iolo fixes these major bugs."
Excellent product. Would recommend to anyone. Great online bank connections. Great scheduled transactions functions.
"I read some negative reviews about this product, but I bought the product, was able to easily upgrade from Quickbooks Simple Start & am using the product without any troubles.
It helps to have someone else knowledgable with Quickbooks to learn how to perform certain tasks, but most of the general accounting, tracking tasks, etc. are functioning fine.
I have an accountant who is trained in Quickbooks & helps me when I have any questions. I refused to pay the extra money for the technical support. I'm sure that could get costly & haven't had to deal with their technical support on the product. I can see how intuit may try to make extra money with this technical support they try to sell with the product registration."
"I bought this with Parallels Desktop 7 to partition my Macbook so I could use Windows-based programs. It reminds me of why I got away from Windows...makes my Mac lock up just like a PC. Slows the system down to a crawl, locks up programs on both sides of the partition. Never had to hot boot my Mac til I loaded this. Better off buying a low end Windows computer to run those programs that can't run on a Mac. That's a whole separate gripe. :-)"
"Great job! Product was shipped ""priority "" mail. Got here fast. Thank you."
"If you like year one, you will love year two and beyond. If you have a job, a couple of kids, a mortgage.... you probably have them this year too! TurboTax remembers repeated data from year to year. No more scrounging for social security numbers, no more repeating your address or your work employer ID etc. This program is worth every dollar."
"I have been using Family Tree Maker (FTM) for many years and recently upgraded from FTM 2010 to 2011.  The install was simple, however, I lost all the profile photos that I had linked to specific individuals in my existing tree when the file imported.  In addition, the merge function in the program that allows you to import files from Ancensty.com is not functional.  So far support has not been helpful so I am reverting back to FTM 2010."
Great item
Great product and price
did what I needed.
"I like this software better than Quicken 2003 for Mac.  It adds a tab called ""Quicken Insights"" that gives you and overview of all your accounts.  You can customize it to show upcoming bills, net worth and other items as you prefer.  There is also more analytical information on investments.  The software installed flawlessly on my Mac which uses OS X and imported my file in a minute or so from Quicken 2003 without any errors.  Registration was a snap.  The product is not as robust as the Windows version but works well.  The new reports available are very snazzy.  I like Quicken 2004 for the Mac."
"I allowed my existing account with Norton to expire by one day thinking I would lose days remaining.  The new product allows for that, but I did not know that.  The day after the expiration my Norton account was eliminated.  I installed the new program in two computers that had been running Norton.  The install was quick but the ""vault"" would not work.  I spent several hours with Norton's help folks to get it running in each computer.  They knew their stuff though.  They tried to get the installed version to work, but in the end had to delete it and download and install a fresh program.  This happened in both cases."
"I've been a MS user (not fanatical, mind-you) since the DOS days; first
PC in 1988 was a Macintosh; first WINDOWS experience was 3.1 then
95 then 98 then NT then Vista then Win7..now Win 8;for full disclosure
I moved all my production applications (Photoshop, Lightroom and Premier
Pro) to MacBooks in Mid 2011; I have not looked back..till now..
My high end Dell i7 Quad core I used with Win 7 to do video encoding
from all the editing completed with MACBOOKs; I decided to take
a flyer and upgrade to Win8 from a VERY STABLE and GOOD OS Win 7;
its been about two weeks now and WIN 8 seems to be growing on me: it is
definitely snappier than 7, shuts down in 10 secs with my SSD, starts up in under
20 seconds and with the upgrade I reclaimed about 15 GB of precious
SSD storage; I've got a Logitech touch pad coming and after I use it with WIN 8
I'll come back and update this review...like others have stated one needs either
a touch mouse or pad or screen to really get the most out of WIN 8

Oh, a word on my upgrade experience is probably in order here..not seemless or flawless
but relatively painless...the upgrade experience gets three stars out of 5; however since
my laptop from Dell is 2 1/2 yrs old in two cases (bluetooth & wifi) the issues
relate to drivers not updated for Win 8 by Dell; Win 8 installed generic drivers in
these cases..audio & video drivers came across just fine, however

Update to follow when I've put some mileage on the Logitech touch pad..

Update:  I have been using the Logitech touch pad (designed for Win8)
for about 12 hrs; it ""significantly"" aids in bringing out the utility
and overall workflow that the designers of win8 had in mind; much like the magic mouse that I use with my macbooks the input devices
now have taken on much more significance utilizing these advanced OS's; WIN 8 update issues have ceased for me (early hangs); I'll keep
updating this review as I gather experience using the OS"
"Unable to access the downloaded file on my computer.  There's a popup that states ""Finding Download..."" and ""Saving To..."" , but the software doesn't open.  Total waste of money.  Will have to repurchase a disc from a brick and mortar store."
So glad I'm not using Windows 8.1
"I've been using the product since v1 and it just keeps getting faster and more reliable.
I am a power user.  I keep the product turned on and in use for at least 8 - 16 hours a day pushing the whole overall system to it's limit.  It's been great!"
Worst version of Quicken yet.  Have used Quicken since 1994.
"While this software is easy to learn and use, it has a few technical glitches that one should consider before purchasing.

The sharpening tool, while great in Version 9, has been a big disappointment in the last two versions.  I thought that Microsoft would have corrected this after magazine technical reviews pointed this out, but after purchasing this version, I can see that they haven't.

One of the big selling points of this software is the ease in which one can create projects....magazine covers, cards, framed pictures etc.  However, one should be aware that not all of these features work fine with all photo files.  After adding a photo to a Magazine cover, for example, and saving the file in the .png format, upon reopening the file, sometimes the photo is fuzzy and highly digitized.  ( The automatic resizing doesn't always work correctly.  When this happen, an acceptable workaround, to some, is to save the file in a jpeg format.  You then have a flattened file that you cannot make changes to after saving, but at least the pictures are clear when reopening to print another copy.)

Other than these problems, the software itself is pretty good for the most part; the short learning curve, ease of use and the large array of project templates make it one the best on the market in this price range."
Made the task of filing straightforward. I have used this software for years.
"This is my first amazon review after years of use.  If I could give it less than one start I would. NOT recommended.  A series of problems: 1) Buggy and crashes frequently 2) Not intuitive 3) Help information useless both online and in product  (e.g. needed to understand how to change overall snapshot/net worth currency from Euros to dollars when all accounts were dollars, very odd)  4) Account import information and data downloads incorrectly and will not allow edits 5) Cannot be returned to Amazon, which I would do in a heartbeat.  Buyer Beware.  Unusable product."
Very good software.
"Product was exactly as was advertised/listed...Greatly, greatly appreciated the fact that although the product was shipped as ""Media Mail"" and took a couple of days longer than usual for long distance mailing...Seller sent with Delivery Confirmation which provided me the ability to track my own order.  Thank you Thank you.

...Look forward to buying through this Amazon Seller again.  Customer Service was exceptional as well.  Product was as stated ""New - Factory Sealed""...and definitely an awesome value, for the amazing price I was able to purchase it for, from them.  Looking forward to finally being able to download and work in logging my Inventory, to begin my own long-awaited Online Collectibles Store!!!!"
The new H&R Block AT HOME program is easy to use. Anyone who does not have genuine difficult tax problems should consider this as an optimum tax program.
"I have been using Quicken for years and bought a new computer that has Windows 8 on it so wanted to upgrade my Quicken software.

This software makes it easy for me to keep track of everything."
Good product.
"I don't know WHAT others are doing, but of all the migration software I've used, this is the ONLY one that worked. And it didn't merely work, it worked exceptionally well and exceptionally fast.

PC Relocator Ultra Control let me pick and choose what to transfer. Make sure you are an experienced computer user if you are going to pick and choose.

I was able to move complicated licensed software such as the Adobe Creative Suite 2 Premium, Macromedia Studio MX etc. Even my roboform came over with all the pertinent data.

Be logical when you choose. Don't transfer many explorer extenders, such as google toolbar or desktop search. They are quite easy to redownload.

Let me put this as simply as possible. If you are an experienced or expert computer user, and you want to move particular software, settings, and files from your old computer to your new computer, this is the software that will do it for you. I have no doubt that 90% of the trouble people have is trying to move things that they ought not move.

If you want to move software suites without reinstalling them, software you've had so long you lost the disk etc. then Ultra Control isn't just AN answer, it's the ONLY answer. (And if you buy it at the alohabob website, it's downloadable and you don't have to pay until AFTER the transfer!)

This is the one you have been looking for."
Very easy to use and compatible with many monitors. The speed conversion really is speedy and includes a basic video editor to clip your recordings. Absolutely would recommend.
"This is a surpurb game created by lego but let's get more specific and let me give you some ratings
Graphics: these graphics are some of the best I have seen and I have seen a lot of graphics believe me, Overall I would give them a 5 out of 5
Sound: The sound is great. There is some cool music but when no music is on you hear water dripping in the cave and voices from your lego men echo. Overall I would give the sound a 5 out of 5
Controll: the controll is excellent. There is not a first person view, but a sky view of all your lego men walking around in the cave. All you have to do is click on them and tell them what to do, and they do it immediately. I would give the controll an excellet 5 out of 5
Difficulty: This game is intermediate in difficulty. There are some times while playing this game you think that you can not progress any further and right before you are about to go insane you find an answer that is quite obvious.
I hope this review was helpfull. A definate must have!"
"I upgraded because the autofill (from memorized transactions) feature wouldn't work on my 2011 edition. It seemed that MANY people online had the same issue. I found Quicken support not to be helpful at all. Their suggestion was only to upgrade, which I did. It still doesn't work! Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. Their support can't help and their product was NOT straightforward enough to allow me to figure it out. I'll keep on looking for better, competing products."
"Item arrived in Garmin packaging, but was ""corrupt"".  I placed the miniSD in my GPS unit and it tried to load the information but failed.  Essentially the whole thing is useless and I don't have time for a replacement before leaving on my trip."
"this is simply the best labeling software for cds. the only problem i had was that the manual was not that thourough. you really have to work with the software for awhile before you realize how all of the features work. for instance, when sizing an image for the jewel box front/back/etc., when you size it larger horizintally, it also increases the size vertically. you do not always want it to do this but after working with it for 3 months and being frustrated by this quirk, i realized through trial and error that you can right click on the image and uncheck the maintain aspect ratio box, and can then size anyway you like. i had been specificaly looking for this option since the day i started using it, the manual makes no mention of it. other than the sort of skimpy manual, this is a great program. the newer version 3.0 is now available for $... more, but i believe the only difference is that you can make cd labels that now go clear to the spindle hole. not that big of a deal, plus those labels cost more than the regular size. i've never misapplied a label either with the applicator, which is quite a clever little device compared to cd stomper etc, with their spring loaded applicators. i would rate 5 stars if the manual was more concise, but my advice is to buy this program (or version 3.0) if you are looking for the best label program available, just be prepared to work with it for awhile to discover all of it's features. you'll be glad you bought this and not memorex/neato/cd stomper etc."
"I have begun to go through the lessons and find it easy to follow and concise in the way the material is presented. I would recommend this product to all. For the money, this is an excellent value."
it is easy to learn it if do little a day plus it help me learn quicker
"Product with elusive fix: 1 star
Product after fix: 5 stars

I had problems h the product on Windows 7. The fix is not fully intuitive unless you have a fair bit of experience in IT. The problem is due to the program not having the ability to write to its own database if the user using it is not an administrator. I was unable to find a fix for this and ended up giving my daughter full administrator rights... not what I wanted to do, but it got the program to work (it was on her personal computer). I made a few phone calls to customer service over a more than a week week and received no callback. I decided to make a little noise and as a result, I was able to be pointed toward a knowledge base article that gave a procedure to fix the issue, allowing me to remove administrative rights for my daughter. I had already looked through the knowledge base, but this item was never shown to me since it was only listed under a listing for all of Type To Learn 4 products (I looked under the home version - the version that I purchased). I found its lack of being included within an applicable version's listing to be quite disappointing. I told the person to whom I spoke about the issue and he said that he would get it resolved.

Here is a link to the knowledge base article:
  [...]
For Windows 7 you will need to give ""everyone"" rights to the C:\Program Data\Sunburst folder.
If you cannot see it, you will need to change the 'folder' preferences to show hidden files and folders within the folders option in control panel.

I have witnessed the previous version well tested within various elementary schools. The children love using it. I found its lessons to be well organized. Unfortunately, the default option of not allowing the children to progress to the next level without getting a perfect score may prove to be frustrating for many children so it may be wise to allow them to progress and let them go back to increase their score. My daughter requested this program to learn how to type... I had to oblige, and am now satisfied."
I played the game at adult level I was bord with this titel and disapointed since enjoyed the final seen  titel
"For the key card version, Amazon keeps selling software marked ""EUROZONE"", which means that it is intended for people located in Europe. If you're located in Europe, this is the product for you. For everyone in the United States, avoid buying this, or you'll have trouble trying to activate it. This was purchased twice directly from Amazon (not a 3rd party)."
"The only complaint that I read about TT is that it costs money for multiple returns.  Geez.  What do you think a tax accountant charges for additional returns?

With the TT's move to allow 5 returns, I don't see what the whining is about.

From what I observe, those who have used TaxCut as a response to their displeasure are only finding increased challenges and shortfalls.  So what is the opportunity cost to go to a lesser software solution?  Your time is worth how much?

I, for one, don't have the time nor do I find the value in spending more time (hours) to use a lesser software package ""just to make a point"".  If it costs $50-75 to use TT, then trust me, it's worth it compared to the $350-500 that my CPA will charge me, especially when I do the same amount of tax prep in order for him to actually do the taxes, using his software."
"I got the gray screen, spinning gear, invalid node, exited with signal 8, couldn't do anything. Applecare told me to take it to the ""genius"" bar. They said it was dead and would install new hard drive. Being a natural skeptic I asked for the old drive back when they were done. During the 2 weeks it took to get it back I researched and bought DiskWarrior and a drive dock. DiskWarrior fixed it in 10 minutes. Amazing. It is worth every penny! I don't know why applecare doesn't give us this instead of the useless utility it does. DiskWarrior is amazing! Saved everything AND fixed drive. All Mac owners should have a copy. And Alsoft's tech support is wonderful as well, they respond right away and are very helpful."
"Great price, great product"
This copy of Windows 10 on the flash drive was very easy to work with. it installed quickly and system is working very well.
"We installed this product at home as an addition to our son who has studied CAD in high school and we hoped this would be a great help at a more reasonable cost than AutoCAD. As avid and above average computer users and troubleshooting skills large capability products like this don't normally worry him.

Here is the review he put together in the viewpoint of a student/CAD user.

===Install===
The installation itself, was as others noted, a bit difficult.  Errors would appear.  I quickly did a search and also read other Amazon reviews and saw the simple solution to use the shortcut it installs in the program directory and to reboot before closing the final error that appeared.  CorelCad launched great from there.  The lack of documentation that comes with the install CD is disturbing as noted by others.

I definitely did not like the way there were so many sub folders it defaulted to and changing some of them was tedious.  I would have preferred if it simply asked on installation to take their defaults or let me pick.  We ran a test install on both WIndows and Mac to be fair since it ran on both.  I ended up running this on a PC inside of VMWare Fusion on the Mac to be honest.

Now my machine is not slow by any means but this program seemed to take a long time to launch and do certain actions.  I hope it is just because of how complex the software capabilities are but make sure you have a powerful machine (way above what they tell you on the box)

===Features and function===
I loved the capabilities this offered.  Pretty much everything I could think of was there. Finding where in the menu or toolbars was a learning experience like any new software.  It would be cool if there was a menu to turn it down to ""light"" mode and reduce the options for simple drawing and then an ""advanced"" mode. This would increase the speed in learning curve or let you jump all the way in right away.

I created numerous drawings with various levels of complexity. The 3D modeling is great and awesome at such a price for this software.

The ability to read AutoCAD files and even export them made it easy to work with classroom stuff I needed to get done at home. So bonus points for that ability for all students and those needing to see AutoCAD files.

===Summary===
A great buy and an even better pricing for anyone needing this type of drawing power at home.  With the ability to run on PC or Mac it reduces more limitations.  Just make sure you have sufficient hardware to run it.  Be patient on launch but then it performed well.  I did not have crashes like others mention in any testing.  Also if you are unfamiliar with CAD software in general expect a few minutes to learn something new.  Explore with test drawings. Create new stuff.  You cant break it making drawings. If complexity is the complaint then more exploration is needed.  It lack of documentation is the complaint I fully agree.  They really need to add more demos and help files.

I give it 4 of five due to the issue with installation and the lack of good help files.  The rest rocks and I am glad I got this to work more at home on my CAD

===Updates===
NOTE: The new CorelCad 2013 update has documentation on the website and much of it can be helpful as long as you are not worried about it referring to a new feature you may not have.  There is also updates for free to the version that comes on the CD that should be downloaded."
Product works like 2006 Quickbooks. I had lost my cd and decided to upgrade. No major changes since 2006 that I noticed but Intuit has great customer service! So was seller.
"I have had AVG for a while now but I see that it is not working a 100% like it used to. I am starting to question the effectiveness it used to have before. It still works okay but not great like before. I think AVG is starting to have the same issue norton, mcaffee and others that are not detecting when some virus are trying to get our pc and letting them through our systems."
I will be reinstalling Office 2003 after discovering that this was inferior. Kind of reminds me of another Microsoft product that has tanked recently.
"The controls of this game are suspect at best. To click on an object you must find one specific spot on the item, which isn't very large, and is very difficult to find. Extremely frustrating for adults as well as children."
"I have been using Desktop To Go for the last six months, synchronizing my Palm III (and previously used it with my PalmPilot Professional) with Outlook 97 (at home) and Outlook 2000 (at work). I synchronize from several  times a week to several times a day, and I find it an invaluable  tool.
The latest version (2.505) has added several valuable new  functions, including synchronization of only changed items (which speeds up  synchronization), and an optional feedback panel that shows what is being  synchronized as it happens. There is also an option that let's you quickly  and temporarily turn off Outlook synchronization for those times when all  you want to do is install some new software.
As with any software, I  would advise carefully reading the documentation before using Desktop To Go  for the first time.
I had a difficulty with installing Desktop To Go on a  newly installed Windows NT equipped computer (it later turned out that the  NT installation was screwed up), giving me the opportunity to find out how  good DataViz Tech Support really is. This is how I found out about the very  fine debug option that allows the manufacturer to get a detailed report on  all synchronization activity and ways to resolve even the most stubborn  tech support issues.
I recommend that anyone who wants to use Palm with  Outlook try this product."
"satisfied with the product, I need to protect a 4th computer now so I will probably have to purchase an individual protection."
Wish there I could have afforded to keep this! I loved it!
"I will never use Turbo Tax again.  The 2014 version was nothing more than a ""bait and switch"" to get you to purchase an upgrade to a product you were told by the cover that you already had:  State Filings.  But you didn't get it.  And when you tried to respond to their ""email rectification"" you were shut out immediately.  When you tried to call their 800 #, no one is there to answer the phone.  Thanks, but never again.  And there are thousands more like me on line saying the same thing.  PS  Don't buy into the phony, ""We'll give you back your $25.00...""  Bunk!  I hand to pay twice to get my state of Iowa taxes filed with this ""Deluxe edition.""  When I submitted a return for the $25.00 extra I paid, three times their web site returned the message:  ""you do not qualify""  OK, I'LL DIDN'T GO BROKE OVER THE $25.00.  BUT I'LL REMEMBER THIS IN 2016!"
"Works well if you only have a few VHS videos to do, but if you have more than 3 or 4 it gets pretty time consuming."
This is one of the WORST program for taking pictures or video from your PC. It doesn't worth a comment. I wouldn't recommend it. But don't buy it.
"I love using TurboTax to do my taxes because it walks you through the entire process step by step. I feel like they leave no stone unturned, so I leave feeling like I've done everything correctly. Last year I was randomly selected to be audited, but it was totally hassle free because my taxes were done correctly. (I simply got a letter telling me I was being audited and a few weeks later got a letter telling me the audit was over and everything was fine.) Also, it is really easy to import the information from last year's taxes, so it gives you a sense of security/continuity.

The only issue I had with TurboTax this year was with the software updates. I was asked to update the software twice before I started filing, and when I was ready to e-file, I was told I could not do so because my software wasn't up-to-date. I updated the software again, but it still wouldn't let me e-file. Once I closed the program and reopened it, however, I was able to quickly file my return electronically. I'm just not sure why this happened when I bought/downloaded TurboTax today and filed my taxes immediately after. This little glitch didn't stop me from filing, though; it was just a bit of a nuisance. Overall, I love TurboTax and will use it every year."
"Topo 2008 seems to combine the discontinued Topo and the current Roads and Recreation software, plus it adds many other features like 911 addresses. Another advantage to the DVD installation is that you do not need to use the DVD when running the program.  Great stuff!"
"I was forced to upgrade by quicken which is a real pain as there was nothing wrong with my old program, but if I wanted to get downloads from the bank, I was forced to upgrade.  That is one way to make sure people keep purchasing your product"
My computer is blocking everything now.  Really slowed up my computer.
I had purchased a previous version of this product and I find it works fairly well. My issue is that the product uninstalls itself therefore defeating its own purpose because all of the data that is supposed to be monitored is lost. I called the manufacturer about this and their answer was that I hadn't purchased the subsequent updates. Well excuse me. I feel that since I purchased the product and additional licenses I should have the discretion of whether or not I choose to purchase updates. I therefore do not recommend this product due to the amount of important data I have lost and their failure to disclose this little detail.
I didn't get all the codes that should have come with it.
"I bought it and though it can do efile for state with additional charge. Wasted several hours input date and finally in the efile stage, it said only offered for CA,MI and NY. Be aware if you are not in one of those three states and plan to use it for state e-file. I ended up spent another $69.98 get my efiling done with TaxAct."
I thought it was going to be more helpful
"Cheaper than the online version. Also... using the Basic version allows you to save previous years and import the data. SO MUCH EASIER than the ""free"" version."
The Complete National Geographic - 125 Years (1888 - 2012)  CDs set is nice for browsing according years and articles.
"I don't have a lot of experience with photo-editing software, but this one seems pretty easy to use for the most part.  The installation process went smooth enough, though it did freeze when I tried to import a picture album and had to be restarted.  It doesn't have as many features as Photoshop, but it's more affordable and the learning curve isn't terribly high.

The instructional manual is very helpful, and the settings are pretty cool.  I like that you can delete people or things in the background that you don't want in the picture.  If you want to make yourself look like a supermodel, there is a way to adjust your weight, smooth your skin out, and even whiten your teeth.  I had fun doing the opposite of that and making myself look deformed.

One thing that is useful to know is that the access code is on the CD cover.  I didn't notice it, and I'm glad I didn't throw it out since it's just a little piece of paper.  Usually, the access codes are in the manual.

The Cyberlink PhotoDirector 4 is fun, easy to use, and is simpler and cheaper than Photoshop, so I'd recommend it."
"Once again Microsoft is putting out {garbage}.  I use Adobe Illustrator and Visio is not even in the ballpark as far as ease of use or capability.  Even for the most simple functions Visio is cumbersome, clumsy and difficult to use.  One example is text that is not scaleable.  Why would anybody in their right mind want a graphics program where the test does not scale with the graphic?  Selecting objects and using layers are both absolutely horrible.  The interface is also very not intuitive!  Microsoft, please put this foolish excuse for a graphics program out of it's (and our) misery!"
"had many frustrations then wanted to charge extra to file electronic State return. The product works, but need to make it easier for consumers"
works great. no issues
It took me being online with a Norton tech for 1 1/2 hrs. to install!!!!!  Crazy!
"I've been using PowerDVD15 and after upgrading to PowerDVD 16 Ultra I am seeing much better
 image quality, deeper blacks, vivid colors and more details in Blu Ray movies.
Its like experiencing the same movie in a whole different light.
Incredible.

"I am so glad to have found this product, written by the same man who is available to answer questions.  I wish there were more products available with personal knowledgeable support.  It works very well for my small business - both for maintaining a data base of customers and for generating labels. Highly recommended!"
"Norton has almost always been my favorite security program. I began using it in 1990 when it was Norton Commander - a menu system for DOS -  and stuck with it through almost all its incarnations. At some point, maybe seven or eight years ago, it became bloated and I began using free products, which worked fine without slowing the computer to a crawl - but I missed the full scans and features in Norton that I always found so trustworthy.

Six years ago, I switched to a Mac and didn't go back to Norton. I used nothing for a while since Macs are less likely to be hacked, but that made me very nervous. I installed the free version of Avast and used it until a Mac-savvy friend who was trying to speed my old Mac back up told me I really needed Norton for Mac. (Indeed there was a disk-filling virus in that machine that only Norton was able to catch - Avast was unaware of it.) He told me to run full scans regularly - not just the quickies - and I did that, too.)

When I got a new Mac earlier this year, my Norton was expiring so I went back to Avast for a while. It's good - it caught a virus, in fact, and does a lot of what Norton does - but it slows the computer considerably.  Now I have Norton in my new Mac and things are running very smoothly. The days of bloat are gone. Norton runs fast and clean and even the in-depth scans don't take too long - or slow the machine perceptibly.

If you need to protect more than one device, get a version that covers multiple devices - it will be a lot cheaper. If, like me, you only protect one computer, this one is perfect."
"Easy to use and follow .  Had a couple little bugs in the calculation of California portion of income on k-1 with the trust I had to do, but is easily adjusted to correct."
"I've been using Quicken since sometime in the 1990's.  Quicken requires mandatory upgrades about every three years (in order to download from one's bank account) With each upgrade, the product gets worse. And I'm getting older (68) and tired of hassling with each upgrade. I wish there were a more reliable product on the market, but there isn't.  Perhaps I'll just start to use Excel.  Quicken could do us all a favor and simply charge for continuing to use an old product. I'd revert to Quicken 2008 - no maybe Quicken 2002.  With the latest upgrade, I can't get my Morgan Stanley account to download.  It did fine in with Quicken 2011.  After deactivating it and reactivating it, I finally got from nothing at all happening to an error message with a phone number to call."
cool program
"TURBOTAX is everything it is advertised to be.

I started using TurboTax in 2002 and have used it every year since. As my tax situation has grown more complicated with investments and a business, it has more than met my needs. It is easy-to-use, complete, and hassle-free.

I take comfort in knowing that it doesn't overlook deductions, credits, or expenses. Once I have gone through the interview process (which is ridiculously simple), I know I have touched all the bases.

Its Deductible is so good I bought it outright a couple of years ago. For charitable donations of clothes, mileage, and money it is excellent. To have a software package that properly values a short sleeve silk women's blouse in good condition is worth it's weight in gold.

TurboTax has saved me money on taxes and given me peace of mind."
does not work with windows 7. even after I talk to a tech it still wouldn't work. it work in a Mac computer. but I was buying another computer to make it work.
Received product promptly. As advertised.
This program can do anything that I need it too. I don't use it for school or a business so that's why I went with Apache. I use it for my own personal use and all the programs work fine and would get it again if I needed to.
"I put this on my windows 7 computer and the quality was horrible.  It did seem like some fun games to play, but it kept stopping."
Really enjoying the protection Webroot is providing. Runs in the background while I don't worry!!
kasperskv good product; ifv i can't write a short review i think i will not buy anything. or rate any products
great game. kids love playing and want to play all the time. Worked great o my computer. will be buying for reader rabbits.
"Reveal codes is an essential part of word processing.  I will never stop using Word Perfect.

Macro recording and editing is easy.  You can make a macro and then create your own custom icon for placement on the toolbar.

I have never been comfortable with MS word, so I am happy to buy each new version of WP.

The only downside is the display of photos on the monitor.  As a photographer, I like all my images to be displayed perfectly on the monitor.  But, after I paste an image into a WP doc, it looks funky.  But, it does print perfectly."
This product has it's quirks. I've had to reinstall it two times on my most used notebook computer because sometimes it just disappears. When that happens my computer would freeze and I'd have to reboot and reinstall the program.
Came as expected
"There is still no QIF import either.  Several of my financial institutions only provide online data in Quicken format.  You would think that Intuit would be able to handle that since they make both products.  As far as I can tell, they have made no effort to address this issue over the years that I have been using Quickbooks. I have to manually convert and enter the data from QIF files."
"If my older version would talk to my bank I would still be using it.  Do not see where the new one makes anything easier or displays the info better.  Feel like I am being held hostage by Intuit and my bank is in cahoots with them.

"I bought TaxCut this year instead of TurboTax, after finding out about the debacle they brought upon themselves. This reminded me why I switched to TT in the first place. While it was reasonably smooth to use, there were a couple of things that drove me a bit batty -- mostly having to do with a correction I was supposed to make. I had money withheld from my paycheck for dependent care, but ended up not paying all of it out for one reason or another. TaxCut seemed to want me to account for it all, rather than letting it expire unpaid.
However, once everything was straightened out, filing was easy: most of the forms and worksheets were straightforward, and it was not a problem that I kept backtracking as more documents came in. The e-file was easy to do, as well.
Backing up my return at the end was more difficult than I wanted, too, but I managed.
I'll probably be back to TurboTax next year, if they behave themselves."
My child loves this movie.  He laughs everytime he watches it.  Would recommend!  Great price and fast shipping!  Highly recommend!
"Recently updated my Mac and needed to get garage band for music editing, (it is a cheap version of editing software I know but it works).  I couldn't find my original disk set and needed a cheap fix.  I saw this product on amazon and figured what the heck i'll give it a try.  WRONG.  The product didn't come in original packaging and wasn't the right disk for my computer.  They fail to mention that you also need to set the computer up with previous steps, I believe re installing the OS in order for it to work as well.  I ended up returning this software luckily and finding my old disks.  I'm sure these work but they didn't work for what I was doing.  Just be careful with software, that is all!"
"A lot of the features found in the ""Premier"" used to be part of the ""Deluxe"" version of Turbo Tax, so it kind of stinks that we have to pay more now to get the same forms that were found in the 2013 version for Deluxe.  Other than that, Turbo Tax is a great program and we always use it to do our taxes.  If you're lives aren't too complicated, you can use Turbo Tax too."
"Photo Plus x4 is listed at $20.99 in the Amazon store, but the download version is listed at $79.99. I would be careful about what you are paying for the product, which incidentally, I have just purchased after extensively researching all the major competitively priced photo editing suites, like Adobe Elements6 (the older version, as is Photo Plus x4). The program is definitely worth the $79.99 price, but at $21, it simply can't be beat.

I have been using the free Gimp2 for some time now, and while it is a very powerful editor, and is free, it does not have many of the  great qualities of Photo Plus x4, which does everything from simple instant photo repair, to in depth tasks such as removing unwanted  artifacts simply an easily. (hint, I watched Serif's video, and was extremely impressed, and I have used Adobe Elements)

For those who want to do simple photo improvements like fixing 'red eye' to more complex tasks using masks and layers, Photo Plus x4 will satisfy those who have no experience in photo editing, to semi-pros.

I can't wait until the product gets to me, Serif is also including the full owners manual, regularly priced at $19.95 and also shipping at no extra charge. It may take a week to get to me, but for me, that is not terribly important. I'd rather have the software and the manual at the same price as the software alone--as well as the CD as opposed to a download, so the choice was simple for me.

Hope this helps everyone!"
My daughter uses it to cut her music for dance.
"My sister and I used to play this when it first came out, so I bought it more for memories sake than for excellent gaming lol. But it's a simpler, fun game. Graphics are top quality, but that's to be expected. But i love this game, regardless, and always will!"
I use this frequently and love the flexibility it allows for mobile reading.
"Basically, you need Windows Internet Explorer to do business transactions with, e. g., certain car insurance companies. If you are not using Internet Explorer from Microsoft when you go to these web sites, they will tell you they can't do business with you. So, that makes recent Windows some kind of a must have for your pc.

If you object to becoming part of their cloud for, say, privacy reasons, and you manage to install Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 using the old-fashioned Windows 7 local, non-cloud password, that will work. But Microsoft recently decreed that you must use the Microsoft cloud name/password to log in to the apps on your computer. That is my idea of invasion of privacy, although lots of people think that going around with all kinds of dissimilar name and password pairs in your mind is perfectly all right, and doesn't constitute an imposition and needless clutter. (This ""decree"" at the moment appears to strike Intel DN2800 desktop machines that use this OEM DVD, and not machines that downloaded the Windows 8.1 update after installing Windows 8 from a DVD. Which implies that, either this DVD has malware on it, or there is a problem with Windows 8.1 defender on this DVD.)

So, what exactly is Windows 8.1 minus cloud and useless apps? Why, Windows 7 of course. And, Windows 7 is the preferred operating system for using Intel atom graphics drivers, something which Windows 8.1 does not tolerate at all."
"Idiot proof is what I needed and this really walks you through everything , highly recommended!!"
I was really after the McAfee program to be installed on my new computer.  I already had a McAfee service on my desktop and thought this was going to be simple addition to the service.
"Product is very good for cards of any kind.  Gets too complex for the fast user.  Does very good lables, both sending and return.

Worth the price of purchase.

JRV"
Really like this product I have since upgraded to 2007 because this will not work with windows vista!  Microsoft did the upgrade with no extra charge.
"Because of the removed forms I had to upgrade not once but twice, at $40 a pop each time, first time because I was newly married but filing separately and second time because I had a 1099. Never had to upgrade for a 1099 before. Anyways, after sales tax I paid over $100 to prepare my return for income from one piddly little wage slave job and one 1099. OUTRAGEOUS. Inuit can try to explain it away, but it feels like a gouge. BECAUSE IT IS A GOUGE.
I called customer service. Got a scripted response with no real address to my complaint, not even a mention of the $25 rebate being offered to disgruntled customers. I found out about that from Googling TurboTax. They don't care, they don't have to. Bottom rung.
Go to the reviews on TurboTax's website and you will see glowing testimonials saying TurboTax is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Seriously, I'm not making that up. It's the headline of a review. No mention of the costly upgrades though. Must just be me.
I used to love TurboTax. I raised up my hands and called it a blessing. But now I have a very bitter taste in my mouth. I'm going to remember this at tax time next year."
"I'm a Win7, OS X, Linux User. I understand that Microsoft is trying to innovate so that people don't say they are copying something from another OS. However, Windows 8 is so touchscreen-centric that it alienates the majority of users who have not bought into or even experienced touch technology. Interestingly enough, even some people with touch technology experience find that the interface is not intuitive enough. Personally, I found that it takes more actions to accomplish the same task on Windows 7. Nice try for trying to innovate, but it makes me less productive and it is still slow! This isn't the same Windows OS we I grown to love. It's worse. Microsoft: want to make your OS better? Make it as stable and as quick to respond as OS X and keep the old interface. Make the new interface a separate OS for tablets."
"I've been using Norton for years.  I get this new Norton 360 v5.0 and install the CD as usual.  The process seemed to be going as normal.  It detected the old version and uninstalled it.  Restarted the computer like it said to and then NOTHING.  It wouldn't continue the process.  I go to manually start the CD again, and the crazy thing had uninstalled the driver to my CD/DVD ROM Drive!  I had to restore my PC to get the driver working again.  Tried the same disk on my 2nd PC, and the same thing happened again!  After over an hour to Symantec Tech Support and having them logging into both my PC's remotely, they fixed the driver issue and installed Norton 360 using my Product Key (which was valid) but something tells me the CD was corrupt from the start.

That was CD #1 that I bought.  I actually bought two Norton 360's at the same time - one for me and the other for my Dad's computers.  I reluctantly tried CD #2 in his computer.  The first time it worked on his laptop.  Success!  Tried the same CD #2 in his desktop and KABOOM!  The driver got un-installed again like the first CD did to me.  We are both running Windows 7 on 3 of these PC's (two crashed and one worked) and the other PC is running Windows XP (it crashed too).

Not sure if this is a Symantec issue with the CD's or if I got some pirated discs from Amazon (the Product Key's were valid though).  What should have only taken minutes to upgrade our Norton on all 4 PC's took 6 hours instead!  Makes me a little worried about getting Norton for next year."
Just as expected.
They don't use this any more.
"This was the worst purchase I ever made.  I wasted the $80 or so on it.  It
didn't come with an ID tag so my copy of Windows only worked for 30 days.  I
tried to call Microsoft and Amazon to get an answer and solution and ended
up in voice mail hell.  It's a shame, all I wanted was a simple copy of
Windows XP and I ended up with hours of frustration and now a copy of
Windows that can't be used."
"The game itself is just great, 5 star. Unfortunately, the program shuts down for no reason every now and then, and I have to fight the same scene again and again just because the stupid error, 2 star. On average, 3.5 star."
We use this every year and plan to continue to do so..highly recommend.
This was just  what was recommended and what I needed the service was excellent
"I purchased the NEAT desktop scanner in December and have loaded hundreds of tax and business documents. I thought the scanner did a good job until Sunday April 1 2012 (this was not an April Fool's joke). While trying to load the NEAT database from the desktop icon I was instructed to reset the database. I was given the option of YES or NO. I selected NO. I tried several more times and the popup continued preventing the existing database to load. The next time the popup arose I hit yes and the program loaded WIPING OUT ALL of my stored files. NEAT does not have a 24/7 customer service. NEAT was totally incapable of helping with this issue. I advised them that there program was in essence defective by having this unsolicited and blocking pop up. There response was ""Sorry about that"". BE WARE! The backup I used was lost as well, just beware."
It works great.
"Been using the SecureAnywhere beta version since it was offered.  It's completely transparent, runs by itself, and works as advertised.  An easy recommendation."
Quality product as usual.
"Does not compare to older Quicken for the Mac. Need it to be like Quicken 2007. I am going to have to change to iBank if they don't do something soon. Older Quicken for the Mac. ie 2006, 2007 will not run on Lion and this version does not do history reports or history graphs. Maybe Intuit has lost its focus on the customer. Sometimes they do this and in the end it will hurt them as a customers like myself will go else where to get the product they need. I have emailed them and talked to there people but for some reason they can't or won't do anything. To bad as I have been a customer of Intuit for over 15 years. So bye bye to Quicken."
"Windows 2000 is certainly not for 98 users. But for NT 4.0 guys, you  should get 2000."
very good defenses. And for that price you cannot get better than it.
"I began using this product years ago, and now that I have children, along with many other responsibilities, this software makes life that much easier. For someone who is not tech-savvy, Anytime is extremely easy to use, and does not require a high learning curve. Installation was cake. I love the iPhone syncing feature the most. I can see this software benefitting both personal and business needs. I've already recommended this to my sister and friend, and they too now use it."
Great service I can pull up what ever I want anytime I want!
"I have been using TurboTax for over 20-years, and was very disappointed to find that the 2014 Deluxe version (which I have used in the past) no longer supports the filing of Schedules C, D, and E.  The lack of transparency and a timely warning to buyers of this change has certainly undermined my confidence in Intuit as a customer oriented vendor.

I will not buy or provide a recommendation in the future to any of my friends that they buy TurboTax or any other Intuit product.  I have scraped my 2014 TurboTax purchase and have switched to H R Block Premium.  So far, I am very pleased with what I have seen with the Block software.  It accurately retrieved the personal and carry-over information from my 2013 TurboTax file without having to re-enter any of the information. While I am still waiting on input information from several financial institutions that will be required to complete and file my return, I have found Block to be as accurate and user friendly as I found TurboTax to be prior to their 2014 screw-up. ."
Very good program!
"I was a practicing CPA for 25 years and have been using TurboTax Delux for 15 or 20 years as well as the Business software. I purchased Delux for 2014 only to find out they eliminiated certain schedules so I had to upgrade to the Home & Business.  Then I got an email stating they would refund $25 after the 2014 returns had been filed.  I looked at the email on April 19 to find out the ""offer"" expired on April 20.  This leaves out those who filed for an extension.  The email also stated one could get a free upgrade but it was not listed in the heading of the message.  I tried to fill out the form to get the refund but I got a message to call a number, which I did today, Arpil 20.  I called the number and got a case number and a transfer to another department which said due to a long wait, leave a number and they would call back one time.  I held for over 30 minutes to get a person on the line linstning repeatedly how to go to the web site to obtain the refune or get the free upgrade.  I was unable to obtain the refund online because I did not e-file.  I did not e-file becuase I had to attach a disclosure document which Turbotax does not support..  This wait time and that for 2 of their people to get a $25 refund is absolutely ridiculous and uncalled for.  Consequently I'm throughtwith Trubotax."
"I was using an Office 2004 for the Mac but needed a updated version since I'd purchased a MacBook Pro. Amazon is the way to go! I checked everywhere and this is definitely the best price. I didn't need the full version of office because all I really use is Office, Entourage and Excel. The Home and Student version includes these and I think Powerpoint. They are all full versions. I was able to read my old documents and since I don't really like .docx, I changed my preferences to save all documents as a .doc unless I specified otherwise. I'll always check Amazon first before buying my software from somewhere else, even the manufacturer (because with Amazon I can get free supersaver shipping!!!)."
"I like Nancy Drew, but the program had a virus, and I could not play the game.  This  said I could not order any more.  Nancy Drew  products."
Can't do complex taxes without it!
Now all I have to do is get a computer with XP so I can play it. It's a great game and I'm patient. I like fantasy games and also the games built on the old Doom Engine.
"I have used editing software for over 10 years and this is by far the worst program i have ever used.  It looks nice. The clip art is lovely.  However, I have just spent hours preparing a flier for a charity project only to have the program delete ALL text and clip art upon saving (using the ""save as"" feature).  This is not a fluke as it has now done this to me four (4) times.  I finally had to print it out and will have to photo copy it rather than print or e-mail it from here as it has deleted my information again.  If i hit the save button at the bottom of the screen it will save but you can not change the name of the file that way, so that would be very inconvient.

In the past i have used several programs, Print Master Platnium (which i lost the disks for and should have just replaced instead of buying this software), American Greeting Cards (which is attiquite), and Photoshop (nice but not really for this application).

Just a side note you also need a lot of excess mouse clicks to get to menu options.  Rather than having font, color, and effects having quick short menus that you can one-click standard options every change has to go into a full menu.  This keeps your working area clean and nice looking, but is time consuming.  Also you can not ""shift group"" all of your text and change the font or color in one group. It has to be individually changed or temporarily grouped and then ungrouped which take a lot of extra wasted time.  A small matter but tidious.  Definately not a reason to not buy this product but a matter to concider when weighing two equally good products.

On the positive side the clip art is really very nice and there seems to be more than i could ever use, which i love.  It also has plenty of fonts to choose from.  I have just bought this software today but the 3D craft projects and the mini albums look like they would be fun to try.  Other than deleting all my work when I tried to save the program is fairly easy to just sit down and use.

I often skip 1 star ratings but please be careful before putting out this much money when other programs work very well.  If you do not mind having to never use the save as function then this may very well be a great program for you.

BRIGHT SIDE WORTH NOTING:
Inside the box there is a 30-day money back guarentee"
Look out Office - This is some great stuff!
"This is an excellent product.  Provides real-time threat protection.  Low cost per month.  Easy installation, and can download at any time (don't have to worry about losing the installation disks).  Very confident in its ability so far.  Don't even notice it running.  Would buy again, and will recommend to friends and family."
Best way to keep up your subscription
First rate option for those stuck with Apple iMac Pages.  Oh the agony of that.
Not sure why I have had such a hard time with this product when so many others seem to enjoy it.  I think it comes down to my Southern accent.
Kindle would not load on my Macbook Air.  worthless
"Let's be real, we all have dozens of kid movies on DVD we would like to digitize. These were bought before digital copies were even an option. (If there was a service you could pay 4 or 5 dollars to do this I would use the service)
I bought this to copy all of the kids Disney movies. Disney makes security very hard to bypass and I don't have the computer skills for some of the ""ripping and burning"" that the web says will work.
Plug the Roxio into your DVD player and the USB into your computer. After download and install of software put a DVD into your DVD player. The video will appear as input. Use your remote to cue the disc to the beginning. Set the record time based on the length of running time on the DVD box. (I always add a minute or two in case I am not in the room when it ends). Just before the movie begins click the record button and let it go. Since you are copying you have to let it play the entire movie to copy it. (Like when you would copy a cassette from a friend in the old days)
When the movie ends press Stop button and it Finishes in a few seconds.  Click the arrow to Export, select your device and click export. Processing takes almost as long as watching the movie. So in a sense you are running each movie twice to get it converted to digital. Our family has 3 ipads so I Export to iTunes. I think it is helpful to have iTunes open before you start.

Now you have a mp4 which I also keep on an external hard drive. I have already done about 80 movies. I plan to buy a MyCloud from WD so I can hopefully stream all of these movies from anywhere the kids have WiFi.
All in all a good product for the price. That in this day and age it takes 3 hours to ""copy"" a movie seems a bit long but once you copy a few it pays for itself pretty quick.
Disney is coming out with an upgrade service where if you still have the receipt from one of their movies and it is on their list you will be able to pay for a digital copy, but I think you have to surrender the DVD so where's the gain.
You will figure a routine like start a movie before bed and export it when you wake up. In that way you can do 30 in a month and in no time you'll have your entire collection copied..."
Works as described
"I just updated it since Intuit no longer supported my older version with bank downloads.  I see no advantages in it over my older version other than it allows me to continue to download my bank statements.  If I were purchasing it for the first time I'd give it 4 stars, but as an update, it does nothing more than give Intuit more money to allow me to keep doing what I'm doing."
"Gah, the software has some easy and amazing features..."
Well it's Microsoft so what can I say
children loved it
very USEFUL
"purchased in 2008, it hosed up my computer from the start and I had to replace the hard drive to remove it, thought about reinstalling today but it will cost me another 29.95 to get it going, not a good product."
Using a MX846 to upgrade my Dell Vostro gave it new life.  Download and install the driver from Dell before you install the chip.  Super easy if you are not queasy about removing your keyboard.
This is the first time I use TurboTax.  I like it a lot.  it is user friendly.  A first rate product all around.
"Great product, great price. My PC is running fast and safe!"
"This software has saved me hours of time, the ease of use is amazing and I have fun running my business. I am more organized than ever before because of QuickBooks."
"It is just OK.  You can use it to create a floor plan, but it is not real user friendly.  For example, I could not figure out how to add a covered porch, that is under the roofline, but not part of the house/air conditioned space. This product is availabvle in a bunch of versions with varying degrees of functionality.  And unfortunately it is difficult to know exactly how much functionality you are buying.  The Help/User manual is based on the most expensive program with the highest level of functionality.  So when you try to research how to do something, you don't know until you actually try it whether it is real functionality available in your version, or only in a more expensive version.  To make it even worse, there appears to be no upgrade path from one version to the next.  I guess you have to buy the entire product and pay the full price if you want to upgrade.  I would not recommend it."
"I love to have Kindle for my pc.  I am from Chile so I read in Spanish.  I would like to have more variety of book in Spanish edition, please.  Thank you,  Judith"
Good product.  I have used them in the past.  Challenge in synchronizing all of my bank accounts--small bank.  Lots of good features.
use TurboTax every year
I purchased this product to prepare for collecting data for my dissertation.  I've downloaded software to my personal computer.
If you purchase this boxed edition of mobile me than you have to wait for it to arrive in the mail but you save $30 off the annual subscription so well worth it. Installation is a no-brainer.
My 10 year old has been sucked into this since he received it. He also got an iPhone for Christmas but prefers this gift. He loves it!
"I had some issue with activating the program but the Vendor GOTO Electronics was very responsive and provided a quick answer and fix to my problem.

The software was purchased to replace my old software which was lost when my computer crashed .  The original was no longer supported by Dell / MS as it was included with my original computer purchase in 2013.

I have used Office 2013 for years and is a great suite of products for both home and business."
"did not like it, threw it away"
"Overall a decent program.
Imported previous tax file and pre-populated fields correctly.

This was for a family member so they were bummed to find out, in the fine print, that while this software does let you file for 1 state, it is NOT a free efiling. To efile your state costs like $19.99 extra.
The only FREE way to file for your state is to print the form out and mail it in."
"Be aware that you only get one state return free with this product. It does not say this anywhere on the product. After a call with the office of the president, they did agree to send me two states no charge."
"I bought this antivirus CD and installed it on my daughter's laptop with no problem.  The problem occurred when I tried to install it on mine (it allows installation on up to 3 computers).  I tried without success to install it.  Then I tried to find the solution on Kaspersky's website. When that didn't work, I tried to find a customer support phone number. I found only a phone number for new sales, but the rep referred me to a technical service phone number, which was not functioning.

I could not find any other phone number on Kaspersky's website, except a Moscow phone number. So I gave up and bought Norton Symantec. I have used Kaspersky in the past, but will never do so again."
"after originally buying a much simpler version, i was ""advised"" by TurboTax to upgrade to Premium...which i did.  And, I was right, i had no use for the upgrade, in fact, next year, I will think twice before participating in any tax software that is not FREE.  The minor consolation is that next year, i will write off the entire purchase price of this software.  Too little...too late."
"My version was System Mechanic 10 - I purchased this product to speedup my computer and eliminate some error messages I kept getting on startup. What a disappointment - it basically just offers a defrag and disc cleanup which my computer performs on its own regular schedule. (most computers do) so I noticed no speedup and the error messages were still there. I tried contacting the ""tech support"" via email.  VERY slow to respond and after making me jump through numerous hoops, send screenshots, etc etc they sent me instructions on how to uninstall System Mechanic. Wow - thanks alot! They do have a 30 day money back guarantee - but of course you can't return it to the store - you, again, have to jump through hoops and BTW there is a 15% ""processing fee"" as well as the cost of mailing the program - and even then they may just opt to just send you another - oh joy! Any way you look at it you will lose money on a program that does nothing more than the tools you can find on your own computer!"
"Good..but the same as Bibble Light, unless you are batch processing. With a hefty additional price tag"
To me Turbo Tax is so much better than H&R because it leads you through every step. I will never purchase a different tax program!!
"So far, I have liked this software, especially features like the background remover tool, the variety of shapes tool.  My biggest complaint is how long this program takes to OPEN!  It literally takes 45 seconds to open the software!  A big change from my previous version of Paint Shop Pro 5 which opened in about 2 seconds."
I've only downloaded a few things but have had no problems and the quality is good.
"After years of niggling problems with PowerQuest DriveImage, I went looking for a replacement product.  Acronis installed easily, performs well, and has been absolutely trouble free."
This is an excellent product; I received the product immediately.  Good seller.
Works great! No issues downloading.
"This product is not user friendly.  I have been successful in the past printing labels after receiving help for this software from the internet.  This year I can find no help.  I have a service, I Yogi, which I pay to give me assistance, and even they could not make the software work.  We could not even export the address data, over 100 addresses, to Microsoft Word.  I have gone to their manual, etc...I would stay away from the program if you are the average computer user."
"Please allow me to put my review this way: there are three dogs. One is a ferocious bulldog, the other is datsun, and the third is an alsatian. Now, I'm going to put tags on these dogs. Datsun is Norton, Alsatian is Bitdefender, and Bulldog is kaspersky.

I needed a dog to guard my home; So, I picked the Alsatian. Result: some thieves were able to fool the Alsatian. Then I got the Bulldog. Result: Thieves didn't dare to come near.

In more lay terms: bitdefender is better than Norton, but weaker than kaspersky. This is my experience,Cheerio!"
"Product is great, BCM isn't available in 2010 office suites so I was glad to find some extra 2007 copies on Amazon.  Thanks Amazon (and it's supplier network)"
This was a Christmas gift for my sister who is a novice photographer.  She's hooked!!!
"This has been a good product for the last two years I had purchased Norton 360.  The Amazon Review request said this was the old version.  I thought I had gotten the ""new"" version.  So far it works fine.  Interesting that Norton sells this product for quite a bit more so I have gone to Amazon and it's free delivery and received in two days.  Norton still does not recognize that I have purchased an update even though I needed to activate through them.  They keep sending me notices saying that my (old) product has expired."
"This version of Office was needed at a client location. Price was a bit high in my opinion, but we needed it and I was glad to find it on Amazon."
"What an impossible operating system! They could have made things so simple and easier, but instead it's completely not self-explanatory and frustrating to find, navigate, and accomplish the most basic tasks one needs a computer for. Stick with Windows 7!!!! If you want your computer to act like the worst of the smart phones from years ago, then this would be the operating system for you..."
Love it
"works well, was good getting downloads of most everything I have purchased thru amazon"
"I was a die-hard Pinnacle (then AVID) fan and if I had a new computer I would probably still be using Pinnacle or Avid or now Pinnacle again. But it just got sooooo sloooowwww that I went looking for a new video editor instead of a new computer.

Here's what happened - Corel VideoStudio x6 wouldn't even install so that one went by the boards. I had a look at Sony and even a cracked version of Adobe Premiere Pro (which would be my choice if I did video editing for a living), Adobe Premiere Elements, Magix  and a few others but eventually decided to give Cyberlink a harder look after fooling around with the demo. I was glad I did.

I edit video infrequently but when I do, I just want to combine my clips, put some music and a few cool transitions and titles in it and not have to re-learn the software to do it. Or wait painfully for the software to catch up to my edits (In Pinnacle, it had to turn the little clock on to just re-draw the timeline and it go soo painful to watch)

Cyberlink was easy to learn, the right click context menus are excellent (do you want to overwrite or move all these clips to the right etc. etc.) and while this would get wearying if you did it day in and day out, when you want to just do some editing, it will give you guidance without having to relearn the software and it  just allows you to get the job done. Sometimes simpler is better.

It also comes with an excellent ""ebook"" that if you go through it, you can pick up the features really quick. There's also a lot of chance for tweaking all kinds of effects and edits if you're a power user but if you're like me and don't really need to do a lot, you can just jump in the software and go.

But there's more - when I upgraded my AMD Asus moterhboard to the 8350 8 core CPU from my Phenom 4-core, Cyberlink just loved it. Things get done right now. There is no waiting. So I also went back to my Avid Studio software to see what would happen with it. Nothing that you would notice. Still painfully slow.

If you value speed, ease of use, lots of features if you really want them, a great user interface, a shallow learning curve and not having to wait for your video editor to think about things too much, I would go with Cyberlink. Works for me."
I have several travelon purses and love this one just as much as the ones I've gotten before (purses are my weakness)
works well with windows 10
"Amazing how MS has people spamming the product ratings here. The bottom line is when this software was released it was *extremely* buggy and Microsoft even acknowledged many of these bugs online, in public fora. They since have made several bugs fixes and a few performance tweaks and the product is more stable as a result, but still not as stable as it should be for public use. Take it from someone who tests major league commercial software applications on a regular basis: there is NO EXCUSE for MS releasing a product that was this poorly tested. The Mac Development team at MS is very small compared to other teams and they are resource starved, so it's less the developers themselves then careless policy on the part of MS management. Were they to put more of their considerable resources into developing this product it would be released on a more regular schedule and likely with better results.

Most of the five star reviews here are either totally bogus, or written by people who write 1 page Word Documents and send email, thinking that makes them qualified to comment on the performance of the whole suite of applications and functionalities. Ask any hard-core Office 2004 user (someone who uses all the apps on a weekly basis) what they think about Office 2008 and the response is almost guaranteed to be negative. For some the only reason to update is that Office 2004, when used on Intel Macs, is really slow compared to older PPC Macs (which Office 2004 was designed for). So for some speed may make this a requirement, but don't expect smooth sailing; choppy seas are ahead until the next major update arrives.

Even at this stage (June 2008) this product is late-beta quality IMO. Almost ready for prime-time. By the time the second major update rolls around, it will be what it should have been from the start. Buying this product by the end of Summer 2008, should be a much safer bet for people. By then I would suggest with the fixes that should be coming, this will be a 4 star product. Not before then!"
"Although it says it works on Vista, the screen is very small."
Perfect product. Easy to do my own taxes
I am new to the world of drawling and I thought this would have easier to use but it was not. I installed this on my Mac running Maverick and it installed well. The software interface needs to be more intuitive and more instructions on how to use it should be provided.
Great Great Great !!!!!!!
"I've purchased the Trailer Life/Good Sam version for a very long time.  Good Sam no longer makes their version available.  This version by the same software people is a poor substitution, the camp ground list is very lacking."
"I use this software both in my real estate appraisal office and on the road, loaded onto my laptop with the gps receiver included, in order to travel to the homes and properties I am appraising.  Put simply, you create your route plan, by entering the list of addresses you will be visiting, while in the office. Then using the route planner and the gps, you are led from location to location, easily and without having to pull over and consult paper maps. I like the use of the laptop, as the screen is larger than those little dash-mount gps units that cost as much as a laptop, but don't do the service."
"Yet another dissatisfied customer.  Been Using Turbo Tax since 1997 with no complaints.  Now you suddenly remove capability from ""lesser versions"" and force folks to upgrade in what is clear to me a money grab.  Yes, you're offering $25 refunds to folks who had to upgrade from TT Deluxe last year, but I was able to meet my limited Schedule A/B/D requirements with TT Basic.  Do I get a refund? Intuit's own refund FAQ page says I don't qualify because (and this is directly from Intuit): ""The vast majority of impacted customers used Deluxe last year, so this cash back offer is only available to them.""  So I'm forced to upgrade TWO tiers to meet the same tax-filing requirements as last year, yet I'm not a ""good enough"" customer to warrant a refund because I was one of the rare customers who got by on the Basic version.  Apparently 17 years of repeat business isn't enough.  Guess what..H&R Block is offering folks a free copy of their software to switch.  Bye bye Intuit, it was a good run but you just made a MAJOR business mistake."
"This software is worth its weight in gold. I'm amazed by the extensive legal help that accompanies every screen, and the fact that the forms are customized for your state. This is clearly well researched and written by attorneys who really care about providing high quality legal documents to consumers.
I also found the program easy to use and very intuitive. Well worth the money!"
Works well so far.
reading my books now!
"this is a great product for Antivirus and security. easy to install and works good.

However, it requires you subscribe after the first year. I don't like this part"
"This is a wonderful program for children who are just beginning to use the computer and they enjoy it after they develop this skill, too.  Children as  young as three can master the program.  I find it is very good for my  beginning kindergarten students.  It gives a lot of good practice in using  the computer's pointing device.  Children learn to follow directions and  improve thinking skills.  Plus, it is FUN!"
I love this free program!!!! It does everything office does. I would highly recommend this download!!!! Easy install and set up.
"I'm a relatively tech-savvy guy.  I work with all sorts of programs from Illustrator, Photoshop & Final Cut.  I needed something to use to score out music.  This seemed like a reasonable option.

Let me be clear.  I have never been more frustrated with any software.  Ever. It is the most un-user-friendly software I have used and doesn't hold to any remotest realm of common sense.  For the past 20 minutes, I've been trying to put in a whole note.  A single whole note.  20 minutes.  Still not done.  Again, I'm not inept at this type of thing.  I've been over and through the manual.  Again, let me be clear.  This is the worst and most frustrating software I have ever used.  Luckily it's on my computer (which I love) or I would have thrown it out the window months ago."
"To this day, I have found this CD to be the most helpful unit of learning.  I use it everyday and use it as a refresher when I need to.
This works well for anyone who needs silent time at the computer to learn as much as you can about these computer programs"
"excellent, i made right decision to purchase this software for less price .nothing missing with my expectation.i will continue to enjoy the benefit of having it."
"Now, I've used Norton/Symantec products to protect my computers for years and was never let down until using NIS 2006. I can break down the problems I've experienced as follows (please note that I have only had the program on my laptop for 3 days):

1) Installation caused my laptop to crash twice, and even after completion, I had to access Symantec's Knowledge Base to fix an additional problem

2) NIS caused my laptop to take 4 times as long to turn on and shut down

3) While using my laptop, Norton would cause my CPU and memory to hit 100%, thereby slowing down my computer and causing constant frustration.

Norton Internet Security is supposed to protect you from adware/spyware, which causes your computer to slow down (among other things); what are you supposed to do when the program that's supposed to prevent slowdown actually causes it on a regular basis? A combination of searches on the internet as well as Symantec has led me to realize that NIS is a faulty program; just look at the reviews here on Amazon!

Now tech savvy or not, if a program causes your computer to function worse than before installation, would you buy it?"
"Seems the system is the same as the old Norton Internet security which I have been using for the past 3-4 years. Pleased with the product, price point is a little high however."
Purchased as a downgrade for older parents who passed the trial date to downgrade from Windows 10.
It doesn't work at all and I don't know why. Any support?
"Basically the same as MS's version, but is easier to train.  Still sounds like a machine, and doesn't answer back."
Love this program!  Initially seemed a bit complicated but videos were a great help!  I was able to estimate the value and am considering the evaluation program.

"We all know the excellence of the Britannica. This DVD version is a very good way to use the vast information available. Not only you can move quickly between articles, but you can take notes, arrange them and use them for your research. You won't need to switch discs for media or text. Everything is a click away. You can get Britannica free on the web, but on DVD you will work faster and you will have more options available."
I haven't noticed any difference with the old version.
"I am migrating from XP.  Windows 7 is crap at best.  I bought a new computer with Windows 7.  I plugged in my external hard drive from Western Digital to transfer my data.  Lo and behold, Windows 7 doesn't recognize my drive.  After searching the Internet, I find LOTS of people having the same problem.  The most basic things just don't work.  The interface may be fancy but the underlying system is not ready for production use by anyone."
This was an upgrade on a brand new computer. I recovered my photos from a backup and ran the bulk import function to create a new library. The import fails and Photoshop crashes somewhere between 21 and 23 % completion. I have posted the problem on the Adobe user forums with no workable response. This sucks. It's unusable.
"I bought the YNAB software after reading recommendations and it had become available for Mac. It has changed my approach to handling my personal spending and in managing my own business bottom line. I am learning to let money sit, unspent, in my pocket or my bank accounts. I am learning to think whether expenditures fit within my income now--- or if I should wait for later, or not spend at all. I am seriously enjoying this process! The help offered online, in tutorials and in the forums, is important for those of us budget-challenged.

I had used Quicken in the past; it didn't help me decide what to do with my income; YNAB makes it clear to see where the money is going and perhaps even to improve how much of it I can hang on to. The philosophy of assigning each dollar a job, and working up to living off of last month's income, have changed how I see my financial life. Well worth the purchase price."
"Fast delivery with good product price.
Software was easy to load into PC.

Really helps in preparation for the PAT section of the DAT.  A must have if you plan on taking the test.

"I have been pleased with this product.  I had no issues connecting or installing the software to my computer.  I have been able to edit my videos and add titles.  I am far from being tech savy and found this to be easy to grasp.  The process does take time, but for the cost I have converted over 20 vhs tapes to dvd.  The quality of the new dvd has met my expectations and is fine for what I want.  It sure beat $20 a tape to send them away."
Fast deliver great software
"I downloaded Kaspersky because it was recommended to me by a personal friend. Not only was the software outdated, slow, ineffective at defending my Windows 10 PC on several occasions, it also is sadly behind with updates compared to other Antivirus Security Options available for comparable prices.

Now, I just wasted 3 hours of my life on the phone with Kaspersky's ""Customer Service"". I was at my computer trouble shooting at the same time I as on hold and found a live chat option. I figured, what the heck, I'm waiting anyways I'll see if I can get someone on live chat. So I did. The person on live chat gave me a link that didn't work at first, the second one he sent provided me with software I could download that would completely remove Kaspersky. However, I did not get this second link that allowed me to download the effective software until I got so frustrated with the incompetent woman on the phone I hung up on her. She would repeat what I said back to me for no reason, so I know that she could hear me just fine. Not only that, I'm on Wi-Fi calling, so... there is no ""cutting in and out"". I could hear her perfectly fine. When she repeatedly attempted telling me that because Kaspersky was not showing up on the list of my ""Remove Programs"" list via my control panel option that it had already been removed from the PC. I told her that this indeed was not the case. There were several reasons I knew this, Windows Defender would not work, because Kaspersky wouldn't let it, also, it showed up in file explorer. She continued to try and convince me that because it wasn't listed under the ""Uninstall List"" that is could not be on the PC. At this point I ask politely (By the way, I have been nothing but %100 polite with this woman) to speak to a supervisor. To this she replies ""I am sorry sir, you are breaking up."" I can hear her completely fine. I have all bars full on my iPhone 6S Plus WITH WIFI CALLING. So a repeat myself, slower, not condescendingly ""May I please speak with your supervisor?"" She replies ""I'm sorry sir, you seem to be breaking up and I can not hear you."" Which I know is complete baloney. This goes on for around five to ten minutes until she puts me on hold. I held for about four minutes, she comes back on the line and says that ""All of our supervisors are currently on a call"" (This is utter and total BS.) She then reassures me (I am about a year away from graduating from UWG with a Computer Science Degree, btw.) that she can assist me with anything that any of her supervisors could. I ask her what my next step should be. She tells me to click on the icon on my desktop called ""This Computer"". I inform her that there is no icon named that. I suggest I open file explorer. She tells me this is not the same thing. She has been hearing me just fine since she got back on the line, by the way. Naturally, when she tells me that I won't be able to find what I'm looking for in ""File Explorer"" I once again, ask for a supervisor. Her reply: ""I am sorry sir, you are cutting out, could you repeat that?"" I repeat myself. ""I'm sorry sir, we seem to have a bad connection."" Me: ""May I PLEASE speak with your supervisor?"" Her: ""I am sorry sir, I can not hear you, we seem to have a bad connection."" I know she can hear me. I tell her this. She says ""I'm sorry sir, we seem to have a bad connection because I can not hear you."" So at this point I am beyond irate. Also, by this point, I have found removal software on my own on the internet and have removed the useless software. I reboot and thank god Kaspersky (better named un-deletable demon software) is finally gone. I open Windows Defender, all is good and I run an update and full scan, everything is kosher. I tell miss (kicking myself for not getting her name) that while she was wasting my time claiming that she could not hear me on a Wi-Fi call to avoid allowing me to speak with her supervisor, I was able to find a solution on my own on the internet. I asked to speak with her supervisor, she asks if I will hold for a few minutes. Five minutes later she comes back on the line and states: ""I'm sorry sir, all of our supervisors are currently on a call."" I take pride in my level headed demeanor and inform the lady that she is an absolute waste of space. I also thanked her for wasting hours of my life. Then I said have a wonderful evening ma'am, expecting to hang up. She asked me some question, I honestly can't remember what it was .It most definitely was not ""Is there anything else I can do to assist you this evening, sir?"" She spoke English comparatively to a 35 year old American having spent a month in Brazil, who came home and claimed to speak Spanish fluently. I think she was making a desperate attempt at repairing her botched customer service call, thinking perhaps that she could pull off some last minute miracle act to somehow redeem her competence as well as her ability to perform her job. I did not afford her the chance and hung up the phone to search for somewhere to write a review about this experience. Never again, Kaspersky, never again."
This software is great. But wish i could use points to .
Exactly as advertised
"Other reviewers have commented on how thoughtful and well-designed Fluenz is.  And I agree with them completely. I'd just like to add that this company has an amazing customer support team. I had trouble making Fluenz work on my netbook at first. When I called Fluenz customer support, I was able to speak to a real person immediately.  And when I called again later on, I was able to request the previous customer service person by name and pick up right where I'd left off. I was actually kind of shocked at how committed they were to making Fluenz work for me. I suspect that most people who buy Fluenz won't have any tech troubles like this, and the quality of the company's customer service team won't make a difference. But it gave me warm tingly feelings about the company, and I think it demonstrates the care that goes into every aspect of the program.  Well done, Fluenz."
"I have used this product for years, just keeps getting better.  Easy to use, comes with great support.  Easy to download from Amazon."
"I don't like overbearing software to begin with. But I have alway's equated intrusiveness with effectiveness?.""WRONG""! Webroot is so unassuming(yet is clearly watching the store,so to speak!) I actually thought it wasn't any good or maybe it wasn't even working(wrong)? Because they never bother me(unless there is a virus)which it does a superb job of keeping out to begin with(and I go to some very,very dangerous sites...!). You ask it to scan your pc when 'YOU' want or need(and not them forcing a scan!)and it does this so quickly that you are sure they must have missed something or are not being very thorough(wrong)? I am always thinking to myself? ""Are these people so good and confident that they don't really care if I really remember how well they are protecting me and if a name like ""Webroot"" isn't exactly.....sexy..? Apparently not? They simply care about doing as good a job as any of their,far more popular compititors(and I have had a few)without fanfare. My kind of security software and if you are looking for the same ""Webroot IS IT""!"
"Windows 10 is so/so.  Still prefer Windows 7...  The tracking in 10 is really agitating and can't be completely disabled!  Oh, and these versions don't include downgrade rights."
"For whatever reason this software was super glitchy. I have tried deleting it and downloading and reinstalling countless times. I checked for viruses etc. I finally got a good download and when asked for the serial key"" which I copied and pasted"" it said my serial key was wrong. I have given up. I wasted my money, maybe you will have better luck."
cool
I Love Kaspersky products and highly recommend them.
You will save the fate of the Earth on this one. I really like it because is so beautiful the surrounding. The puzzles are great and you have the library to get all the information to solve them. I enjoyed it. It's a family game and very cultural. It made me feel like my days in middle school but with more fun.
This program helps us see where we are in our finances. It is our goal to be debt free and this is a huge help.
"I started using Quicken back in the day when it looked like nothing more than a glorified electronic spreadsheet with pretty buttons.
When Microsoft released MS Money I switched to it because it was more intuitive than Quicken.
Now that Microsoft has abandoned that piece of software I switched back to Quicken and I have to admit it took me a while to get used to it.
To add insult to injury, I have recently switched from the Windows to the Mac platform and, in spite of reading the 300+ negative reviews for this software in Amazon.com, I decided to give Quicken Essentials for Mac a try.
So far this is what I have experienced:

- The software installed quickly and without a hiccup in my new iMac.

- I reviewed and closely followed the instructions on how to convert my Windows data so that it would be recognized by the new software. This was done without any problems or delays.

- I did have to set up again each one of my twelve bank accounts online individually, something that took me all but 10 minutes. Afterward I was able to download all my data to keep my accounts current.

- I was happy to find some of the same features that were present in the Windows version, such as Budgeting, Investing, and Mortgage tracker.

- Finally, I like the software interface in the Mac, which looks just like any other Mac software with colorful icons placed intuitively where I need them the most.

All in all I recommend this software without any objections.
And no, I do not work for nor do I have any holdings in the Intuit company, for those who'd want to know..."
"I might love it if I could get it downloaded and installed. I have tried 4 times, 3 of them with Adobe Support. Each time it appears to have been a successful attempt, but I still cannot use it. Adobe keeps giving me the same operation which hasn't worked."
"This is just a short review about the pronunciation correction feature.  Many of the other comments left here refer to the audio companion as being an advantage.  Actually, it does NOT recognize tonal differences.  I have been studying Chinese for a year and have always been given great compliments about my tones in Chinese (my Chinese is NOT good yet, but I do well with the tones).  Just out of curiousity, I did the wrong tones on purpose and the voice recognition system still tells me that I am correct.  It WOULD be a great help for those struggling with the basic sound system of Chinese, but in the classes that I have taken, it seems like most students struggle more with the tones and this product pretends like they don't exist when it grades you.  I even asked a Taiwanese friend to test it out for me, and she agreed that it will still tell you that you are correct even if your tones are wrong.

Other than this, I am happy with the system so far.  I do not expect to become fluent with the system, but it seems like it does well for what it is.  Just another tool among many to help me inch toward my goal of eventually being able to have a conversation in Mandarin. :)"
I purchased directly from the company. $39.99 for ExpressBurn Plus for Mac during December 2017.
"I have used quicken deluxe for many years / when 2014 was available to me last week I tried to download to my computer and was charged on my credit card but the download did not work / today I stayed on the phone for over an hour and finally gave up / I now have to call American Express to have the charge removed / I will continue to use quicken 2013 because it is a good system but dealing with Quicken when you have a problem is a nightmare

"In general, I think SuSE has always produced a great product.  I've been using SuSE since version 6.4 and It's been my primary home operating system since version 8.0.  I do not use Windows at all.  I'm currently running SuSE Linux 8.2 and I'm very satisfied with it.  I was anxiously awaiting SuSE 9.1 and the new SuSE kernel in the inexpensive ""personal"" edition that I've always used to update my SuSE Linux O/S.
I soon discovered that Novell has changed things!!!  !!!YOU CAN NO LONGER UPDATE YOUR SuSE Linux OPERATING SYSTEM USING THE PERSONAL EDITION!!!!  I'm not sure if this changed in version 9.0 or within this version, but it was a shock to me.  I've always used the inexpensive personal edition and supplemented it with downloaded software from various sites online.  To all long-time SuSE Users considering buying this version, be aware that you will need to have the ""update"" or ""professional"" edition to update your current SuSE Linux system!
I'm very disappointed by this change, particularly since I spent about $30 on a version that I have no use for whatsoever.  The box should have been clearly labeled to indicate that this version CANNOT BE USED FOR UPDATING SYSTEMS and I would strongly recommend that Novell place this prominently on the box in the future!!!
For USERS NEW TO SuSE AND/OR Linux WHO WANT TO GIVE IT A TRY, I can recommend this edition however.  The ""Live CD"" makes trying SuSE painless and SuSE is still probably the best desktop Linux around for the price that's *relatively* easy to install, configure, and enjoy.  As for those users complaining that it doesn't work with or like Windows, I think they just wanted a cheap Windows knock-off, but Linux is something different and has to be approached as a separate thing with its own merits.  A new user will have to learn Linux just as they once had to learn Windows.  It's an adjustment, but it's not so bad if you can devote a little time and energy to learning it.
Novell folks reading this review: LABEL THIS CLEARLY NOT FOR UPDATING, DANGIT!!!!  IF I EVER WASTE MONEY LIKE THIS AGAIN, I WILL BOYCOTT YOUR PRODUCT!!!"
Works just as described.
"I barely use it. It's kinda nice, but I don't feel compelled to use it much. I have this problem with Amazon prime. I don't love the idea of downloading more software, but if i'm going to, I would like it to be an all in one, where I can browse amazon store, Audible, listen to music and specially, watch amazon prime video (which everytime I try feels really hard to navigate and use, being used to netflix or spotify )"
"I have had nothing but problems since ""upgrading"" to Windows 8. Keep 7. Much better! This is the same as when Windows had Vista. Wait until Windows 9 or keep XP or 7."
TURBO TAX Premium has always been a great choice for me in tax software.
great
I really love it.
"I bought this program to use as an address book. I would recommend that you retain your paper address book, as it's difficult to impossible to operate. This program is user hostile. Find something else."
"Up until now I have been happy with Amazon and their products. I purchased the Serif Photo projects  3-22-2013 and most of the choices do not even work you cannot edit any of the photos or remove red eye you can't resize and every time you click on a choice they want you to purchase part of it in order for it to work.  I paid $20.55 for it and the very next day I found it on amazon for
$4.48 now that is ripping people off.
It is not even worth the $4.48 not to mention $20.25 It does not work properly with windows 7 so this is just trash to me.
You can't even return these digital products even if they do not work on your computer properly."
Very good security
Movavi Photo Editor has been my go to photo program since Nov. 2010. It is an intuitive program that quickly yields the results I need.
"I am a special education teacher and have found this software a great review tool for fraction concepts in particular.  Students are much more interested in knowing which number is the denominator, for example, if they need that information to get points in a game and get to the next level.  I like that you can choose to play the game with or without troggles (monsters that chase you) too.  Although I have the windows 95 version (which was available used at low cost), it's worked fine for me on XP too.  I'm very pleased with it."
"Windows 2000 Advanced Server has been such an excellent platform, and I have no plans for its retirement from my network. It plays well in the Active Directory environment of my Windows 2003 Servers and also handles the execution of some of my legacy applications. As for other platforms, Linux (especially my favorite, SuSE) offers an environment that opens you up to the open source world (especially important if you are involved in research, as so many applications from the research community evolve from the open source arena). Open source is where the action and fun is!  Im looking forward to a pet project of integrating my SuSE Linux & Windows servers, perhaps along LDAP lines, later this year. Its all about opening up possibilities, not cat fighting, and Windows 2000 Advanced Server is cordially invited.

By the way, keep in mind that Windows 2000 does not support 48-bit LBA out of the box, nor does it after applying all the updates and service packs. 48-bit LBA must be enabled manually, at HKLM\system\currentcontrolset\services\atapi\parameters:

Add the following value: EnableBigLba.

Datatype: REG_DWORD

Value data: 0x1

This is mandatory for running with harddrives greater than 137GigaBytes. The consequences for not implementing this switch are data corruption and complete loss of your NT2000 partition. See Microsoft's service article Q305098 for authoritative details as we stretch our legacy systems to the limits:)

5 stars, for the revolutionary advances that set the course for NT, and made it possible at last to manage systems and still have enough time afterwards to actually do something with them:))"
"I've been using quicken 2013 for 3 years and *had* to upgrade (not that I didn't expect it) but I had hoped that it would be better in 3 years. There are still things that bug me a LOT. Like the fact that it refuses to recognize my direct deposit as such and label it as salary - it looks the same every week and yet it can't recognize it. And I don't like that if it sees a recognized name it questions whether it is the scheduled payment (it's not - if it were, I'd label it as such). And I was very bugged that I switched versions so I could keep my connectivity with my bank and then I had to call my bank so they could walk me through reconnecting my accounts. Not impressed"
Great Product.
"As always, works great. Been using this product for 10 years or more. If you're not into answering financial questions and organizing your finances, you'll probably want to use an accountant, but I find this program simple and cheaper."
i am safe
Easy to install
Have been running this on my laptop for months.  No complaints and really I notice no real improvement over XP
Bit defender crashed my computer immediately after installation. The only way I could get my computer to work again was to do a  restore.
"This has been a great game for my 3 year old daughter--she loves to draw and color and this game seems to tickle her creative interests.  It has been an exceptional, inexpensive purchase and one she can play over and over with new challenges.  I guess I'm writing this review because we have purchased some duds and it is always nice to see a ringing endorsement of something that really works!  Hope this helps you."
Great for drafting legal documents
Just got this version set up and running.  Lots of changes from QuickBooks Pro 2012.  Not sure I like this newer version but time will tell as use it more.  I do wish that Intuit would support their products for more than three years but they have to make their money just like everybody else.
"The cd arrived in three days, and updating my gps was a breeze, I had no problems and everything is working fine. I'm very satisfied with this purchase."
"I'm writing this to help provide a realistic review instead of the one line negative reviews, and the overly positive reviews that don't give real details.

I actually bought this at Best Buy, just in case I had a bad experience, like some others, I could more easily return it.
I had a similar product in the past from ION Audio, and it worked for a while, but at some point, it stopped working for unknown reasons.
I have 64-bit Windows 7 Ultimate with 16GB RAM.
For this product, I installed the drivers and software from the CD, then downloaded and installed the Windows 10 patch from the vendor web site. Then I plugged it in. It was immediately recognized.
I connected the video and audio cables to my VCR and the Roxio device, and fired up the app. It worked, and I saw the blue screen from the VCR. I selected the Record, Edit, Save feature, and recorded two VCR tapes to my PC. The quality was OK, as the tapes were 22 years old and not great. It did output to MP4, which is nice. Those files will play fine on phones, tablets, PCs, and ROKU devices.
The Roxio software is not that great. When I tried to write a captured video to DVD, it appears to have written it out for the wrong region. I couldn't get that feature to work. I also had times when the app would hang.
Later, I fired up CyberLink Powerdirector 9 (which I had from the ION Audio device), and surprise! it recognized the Roxio device... I was able to write the captured videos to DVD.
I was also to capture more VCR tapes using Powerdirector, and it did a good job... It's also better at doing some simple editing as well.

So, the device appears to be fine, but could use better software. If you can get a copy of Powerdirector, you'll probably have good luck."
"I bought this product as a result of glowing reviews from other customers. After using this software, I cannot help but feel the same! originally was very worried about the PAT section, this preps you well!!!"
"I had 2 years of high school German many years ago and now that I am retired I thought it might be fun to learn a new language to help keep my mind active.  I picked Spanish because I never really used the German I learned and with Spanish TV and trips to Yuma I figured I might be able to use it.  I did quite a bit of research to find a program I could really learn the language at home on my own schedule.  This is the best program I found.  The program teaches you how to understand, speak, read and write the language.  It is done all in Spanish through pictures.  You are shown a picture and you are expected to respond in Spanish.  The voice recognition decides if you are speaking it correctly and does not continue until you do.  It also asks you to type answers in Spanish to questions or pictures.  It builds from single words to sentences and to groups of sentences.  You can go back and redo lessons which I have many times but it also retests you at timed intervals based on the questions you missed.  I have been working with it for 5 months now and really enjoy it.

Some things you should think about before you buy this expensive program.  Learning a new language while fun is also very time consuming.  The person taking the course needs to be motivated to continue because this isn't a 2 week course but a learning system and will take you a year working every day to become fluent enough to actually use the language.

If you are really committed to learning a language I'd suggest you buy all 3 levels at once.  It is expensive but far cheaper that buying them one at a time.  I bought the first level to see if I would like it and then ended up having to buy the other 2 levels separately.  This gave me 3 sets of headphones.  There is also an audio companion that comes with each level.  I found it difficult to use and stopped after a couple of months.  I may go back and try it after I have completed the levels.

What else do you need besides the course?  Well, I would suggest a good Spanish/English dictionary.  Sometimes it is hard to tell exactly what is shown in the picture.  You can get Spanish children's books from the library and of course Spanish TV.  This will help you with the sound and rhythm of the language.  You can listen to popular Spanish songs.  You've heard the phrase ""Lost in translation."" well the words that flow so well in one language probably won't in another.  The rhymes of Dr Seuess work well in English and fall flat in Spanish and the lyrical Spanish songs sound clunky when translated.  But don't let this stop you.  The goal is to think in both languages.  Once past level one I would suggest the book ""Breaking out of Beginner's Spanish"" by  Joseph J. Keenan.  It is not a language book but a book on the customs of Spanish countries.  Using I when talking about yourself is common in English but considered self centered and arrogant in Spanish so it is dropped.

If you are considering Rosetta Stone for someone else or aren't really sure for yourself they offer a free lesson CD.  Try that first.

I got iListen to help my son with a learning disability speed up his writing. The system seems to be unable to understand his 10-year old voice. I'm going to try training it again but he's pretty tired of reading (not his strong suit) aloud into the microphone over and over.
Poor quality of outcome. Used with 3 different pc and mac and 3 different printers. No result at all. It is my worst buy ever!
"I upgraded from Vista.  HP laptop and printer were less than 6 mos. old.  As soon as I upgraded, laptop constantly freezes when viewing Youtube etc.  I believe it's an issue with Adobe Flash Player not being compatible with Windows 7 64 bit.  There's still no driver update from HP for wireless printing with this OS.  It's been a disaster.  Stay with Vista or go get a Mac.  Gotta go before this thing freezes agai"
"Purists beware. This is very loosely based on your beloved TV series. If you can put away any expectations you might have and enjoy Will Ferrell's unique brand of comedy, you will realize this is the best comedy that has ever been made.

"I can finally remove Parallels for Mac and stop running the Windows version of quicken!
The file transition from Windows - although a challenge - worked quite well.
A great version 1.0.....Looking forward to bug fixes, more features and full use of IOS 8 graphics.

Pluses:
-file transition went well - even with complex brokerage accounts  (previous Mac versions were very poor)
-Program is well featured - but not as much as Windows equivalent
-Price is right

Minus (needs work)
-Direct Connect system crashes frequently
-Direct Connect does not permit any edits of download - very difficult to correct errors
-No reconciliation of brokerage accounts (why???)
-graphics are frustratingly non-adjustable....key features are hard to find...fluffy stuff is easy"

"I've been waiting for a version of this program that runs on NT for a long time. This one does it. It has always been my favorite drawing program and the current versiocabin continues the excellent tools from the past.
I have a bunch of minor squabbles... I'd love more control over furniture, and I'd appreciate a more rational way of fixing the size of free space than building a dummy cabinet.
Overall a really nice upgrade."
"I work for a medical facility where the medical staff uses Dragon. There are soooooooooo many errors it's pathetic. Words that sound similar are the worse, like the boy fell out the back of the trunk instead of truck. Numbers are terrible too. I wouldn't want this program if they paid me. Run don't walk away from this product."
"from Rodney, Unable to load this into my computer and I would like my money back, $109.99, please.

The new TurboCad Deluxe 2D/3D 2016 may be great software, but the problem is, getting it loaded into my computer. I was unable to get it loaded.  I emailed TurboCad tech support and Travis Fleenor tried his very best to help me with several suggestions.  I kept getting an 1935 error.  The final suggestions were taking me further into my computer than I was comfortable with.  I didn't want to take a chance in making changes that would mess up a perfectly good computer.
Apparently numerous other customers have been having the issue as well. No idea whether they were ever successful getting around this issue."
Thanks.
I thought this to be very inexpensive for all that we got.  Great for the you boys for their computer center in our home school.

"I didn't think I could find this anymore! for many years I used Microsoft Money - happily! Very happily! Wonderful software, user friendly, and highly versatile. I could quickly and easily download all bank transaction, track investments and print of tax reports in a snap! Then I switched to Mac. And Microsoft stopped making the software. Suddenly years and years of financial data were lost in a file that I could not access. (I didn't know Microsoft had stopped making it, there was no Mac version, and I would have to convert everything to Quicken - not a flawless process by the way!!) Mercifully for Amazon, I was able to buy an older copy of the software, get it installed on my Mac using Parallels - would never do that again! Would by an old PC or netbook first! Anyway, it saved the day! I retrieved the data that I need and have started fresh with a quicken setup.

For all of you die hard MS Money users out there, or for anybody else who is stuck, it's great, it worked, it saved the day! Oh, and if you want to buy my copy...? drop me an email!

"I got a really good deal on this product. It's not a heavy program and runs quietly in the background. So far, has removed multiple trojan files/malware that my previous McAfee version could not remove or could not even detect.

GREAT
"I just bought a new computer, which required upgrading from Quicken 2003. I was very happy with Quicken 2003. It did everything I wanted. Quicken 2014 is GARBAGE! I frequently use Alt + Tab to switch back and fourth between applications, and NEVER had a problem with Quicken 2003 losing focus. Despite a field being highlighted when I Alt + Tab back to Quicken 2014, I can't start typing or pasting without actually clicking in the field. Oh, and about copy/paste... I can't copy/paste into Quicken 2014. I'd give it zero stars if that was an option. To give an idea just how unhappy I am with Quicken 2014, I'm trying to figure out a way to reliably install Quicken 2003 or 2004 on my new Windows 7 machine, and manually retype the last three weeks worth of transactions! Last, but not least, there's Quicken's updates, which consistently fail. I have administrative privileges on this computer, so it shouldn't have a problem applying updates. But I click OK to update, and it sits there doing nothing."
"I bought this hot steaming pile of poo at Walmart, installed it, ran some of the utilities, and voila! I had to reinstall Windows XP!!
I believe it deleted some critical registry items (I should have known better, so shame on me).
I couldn't wait to uninstall this crappy program.
Don't walk - RUN away from this one."
Awesome product!!! Thank you very much.
"The amount of cards and projects are astounding.
very user friendly."
So I had to load this on my laptop so I would have the latest and greatest version. However since I don't have a touch screen I find that it now takes me more steps to do the functions than in windows 7. I think that's because it assumes you have a touch screen. It works without touch screen but is less efficient.
"I don't like how the software saves my passwords, it makes it very difficult to find them... well compared to Kaspersky."
Used the photo section for printing photos on quilt blocks.  Very helpful.
"The last 2 versions of Norton's anti-virus was difficult to install, and even harder getting it to work right.  Their customer service, even though they speak English, I don't think they understand.  None of their solutions came close to fixing the problems.

Kaspersky 6.0 was easy to install, easy to set up, and works great.  I had no problem updating the program the first time even though I still have dial up.  It does not create problems with my WIN XP, programs.  I did exit Spy Sweeper while installing Kaspersky to avoid a problem.

I also use TREND MICRO on another computer, and it works okay.  Only problem it has long download updates.  Their customer service solved a minor problem with one call.

Reading the reports on Norton's Anti-virus, I think I made a good choice.

"I downloaded this from the NCH site at half the price. Even so, it's a solid, utterly reliable programme that does exactly what it says it does. Simplicity itself."
"I know this is a GREAT program for beginners.  For some reason it wouldn't work on my computer.  Not enough memory?
I don't know....

There is vocal instruction; and I thought I was ordering the OLDER version with ""just the astrology software.""

IF anyone has the old version of a DVD of just the software without vocal instruction, please contact me. I didn't see it.

Even though I have to return it in the next few days, I DO HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR THE BEGINNER who needs vocal instructions.  This will amaze you, entertain you and impress your friends.  As a matter of fact...you will use it so much, you will wear it out and have to buy another later."
"I have been using TT business for 6 years.  It makes doing my corporate tax returns about as easy as it gets.  It's actually easier than having an accountant do it.  I have 3 companies.  Total time is usually about 5 hours for all 3.  My only complaint is the price on the state, but I always end up paying it because it makes the process just too easy."
I thank Amazon every day
We purchased Home Designer Architectural 2012 and have had nothing but problems. When we started the program it says you need to upgrade your video card driver. So we did that and the message still came up. We searched the Home Designer site and they say you need to buy a better video card. We searched some more and found people who bought new expensive video drivers and it didn't fix it. Some even purchased a new computer and it still didn't fix it. Do your own homework before you get stuck with it.
Don't understand it but love it.
"I have been a Panda user for 2 years.  When it expired in May I bought the Panda Global 2010  version for 3 computers.  I have Vista.  Now I'm a patient person but  to get it to work  I have to restart several times because Panda protection does not start on boot up and suggests restart after I get error message that internet Proxy is not working.  It became easier to just not shut down my computer but when you upgrade you have to re-start and the process starts all over again.  Then they suggest uninstalling and re-installing the product.  This I did several times;  doesn't help.  Sooner or later you get another message:  Run time TO TERMINATE error message that Program:...\PandaGlobal Protection 2010\PAVJOBS.EXE wishes to close in an unusual way.  So now you try TECH. support.  THIS IS A JOKE!  YOU CAN'T TALK TO ANYONE.  IT TAKES 1-2 WEEKS TO GET EMAIL REPLY.  Their answer:  ""Hello,  Please try the 2011 trial virsion of Panda global protection. if it works correctly then please let me know and i will upgrade your 2010 to 2011 at no charge.""  This is a direct copy paste quote.  Followed the link they sent me and It was wrong kept sending me message about needed password.  Sent them another message.  They sent me another link.  With detailed instructions.  Now the link they sent me had none of the actions that corresponded to the link.  (Of course like I said has taken 2 weeks per response)  Replied again that the link they sent me was wrong.  Waited another 2 weeks.  They sent me a satisfaction survey for my ""TECH. SUPPORT"".  I deleted PANDA FROM MY COMPUTERS."
Very good
I still love this AV program. This has been my lifesaver for 10 years or more.  I have used it with various Windows versions and like Avast's very lite use of resources even on older machines and it has never let me down. The price is free so what are you waiting for?
"I usually don't leave a review on the net.  Actually, this is my first time to leave a review on Amazon, even though I am a long-time Amazon member. However, I'd like to share a few thoughts about Pronunciation Pattern for those who are interested in an English accent program.

As an ESL instructor for many years, I've tried many different accent reduction programs (books, CDs, etc.) for my ESL students.  I've literally come across hundreds of them.  Many are terrible, some are ok, and a few are good, but this program is the BEST.  It really stands out.

Since other reviewers have already mentioned about the good features of this program, let me just make my review brief.

PROS:
* The online support is GREAT!  I've contacted customer service several times so far, and I always get a prompt response - sometime just in a few minutes!  I am really impressed with their online support.  So far I've been 100% satisfied.
* This program is VERY comprehensive. It deals with so many different aspects of English pronunciation. It also covers several thousand English words, NOT only a few hundred.  It's not like you study a few days and then there's nothing more left.  I know from personal experience there are many accent reduction programs (and books with CDs) out there with very little content.  This program offers not only the sounds of individual words and sentences but also clear phonological explanations.
* This program is good for advanced ESL students too.
* Like most non-natives, ESL students are familiar with the IPA, and this program lets you choose IPA to practice the sounds of English.
* What I really like about this program is they keep upgrading this program automatically.  I think that's another plus for this program

CONS:
* The high price might be a problem for some ESL students.  But l still believe this program is best on the market.
* Since this is a computer-based program, some people might think this program is complicated to use.
* Not really a ""con,"" but there are a lot of features in this program to learn.  If you are looking for a simple English accent course, this program is probably NOT for you.

BOTTOM LINE:
If you are an ESL student (or instructor) looking for a program that reduce your foreign accent, look no further. I say it again: This program is the BEST"
"Do NOT waste your money.  Not because the product isn't good.  It is easy to use but the Will you put together cannot be notarized.  We could not find a bank, notary, paralegal, attorney or anyone to notarize our Wills! Evidently this is something fairly new.  If you call a notary, confirm ahead of time that they are notarizing a Will. Our own bank would not notarize it! We were in the middle of a Refi and the notary who came to our house wouldn't notarize our Wills! Why you may ask? We were told that if someone in the Will contests it, the notary and witnesses must show up in Court and that is something none would do.  An attorney will do it, but only if they draft the Will themselves and then they can legally charge you hourly for any Court time. What a big, fat waste of money."
"It slows down start-up, downloading files from Internet and every aspect of computing. It acts like just like a virus, always in the foreground. It slows down opening any file or program. The real nightmare begins if you let your subscription run out. You are notified at each start-up with a red flag. The good news is, I got no virus while using the program. The bad news, it hijacked my computer until I uninstalled it. After I uninstalled it, what a relief I got my computer back.  I replaced it with McAffee which offers a much faster and less intrusive virus protection."
"Outstanding Last Century quality for all test equipment using radiated pickup for signal reading , and measurements .

Buy 2 , or more for keeping around the shop."
Rough rugged stylish phone case you cannot go wrong with Spigen!
This is a very good design software and is easy to use.
"It was as advertised.  I have it installed on two computers, and will be able to add it to one more as soon as I finish building it.  The price was great.  One of the best deals on software I have found."
This version is very basic. If you  know nothing about quickbooks it may help. I felt as if it was a starting point to sell you the the more advanced version. If i had it to do again I would skip to the next version and not purchase this one
"All I got was key code number, not actual downloads. Now I've tried to add this to my current subscription with Norton and it added days but no info. Don't know how many downloads I've used. This is not how I have ordered previous Norton products."
It is very easy to use and we got our returns (federal and state) very quick.
"Great and very easy to use! The AutoLearn is especially great as it is similar to spaced repetition, and it gives you the pronunciation by two native speakers from different regions to expose you to different ways the word can be pronounced. I haven't experimented with the Voice Recognition section, but it looks to be great as it can give you feedback on pronunciation. The vocabulary sections are structured, in that you can learn different areas such as the house or food, as well as having the AutoLearn for reviewing words in random orders. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone, and it definitely outweighs and outdoes Rosetta Stone in all areas! Combine this with speaking with native speakers once a week and you are on your way to success."
"I would have giving it a 5 start if its not for the fact that It will not work well in Windows 8.
It works great on Windows 7 and XP but very bad for Windows 8.
Also is annoying that Kaspersky one of the best companies in the business has updated all the low end products Like Anti-Virus and Internet Security to work on Windows 8 but Pure have not been touch yet.
Beside that if you are using Windows XP or 7 and have multiple Computers the product is great.
Some very useful tools like Password manager and Other Clean up tools.
For that reason I will give it a 4 out of 5."
Not always easy to use and was difficult to get working on my mac.  Doesn't work the same on all devices.
Had a free 30 day trial of McAfee when I bought my new Dell. I caught a virus !! Nuff said. I should have removed it from day 1 and put the AVG that I had purchased right from the beginning.
The Key helped me
Tried to use the discs. Put the discs in and it brought me to ITunes to the music on the disc. Could not get the games to play or download. Would only bring me to the music.
Took a little getting used to since it was for my Mac system but all is well. I'm rolling with it now and I still love my Quicken products :-)
"Thank you for giving me my computer back!!! There is nothing but wonderful things I could say about this, I needed to reinstall my Windows 7 after my computer had been hacked and the programs removed. This DVD reinstalled it to factory condition. It was easy to do with the instructions that were enclosed. I don't know why others had anything bad to say, maybe they didn't follow the instructions correctly, but it is not hard to follow."
"The product description states that this software is optimized for Windows 10. It downloads, but will not install, even with downloading and installing the Amazon software and the software manufacturer's Origin. This program is crap."
Cannot download!!! This is a joke!!!
"Like everyone else, I agree that the box is a bit misleading.  The 3.5 million pieces of clip art are not on the CD - they are available via the **included** one year subscription to their web clip art service.  HOWEVER, with that said, I have a couple of other large collections of clip art on multiple disks and it is a real pain to search the various disks.  And I have to lug them around (CD's are heavy!) if I want to use them with my laptop away from my desk.  I much prefer the web-based approach of this collection, rather than having to juggle a lot of CD's.

We mostly use this for my son's school projects, so the licensing terms are okay for us either off the web or from the CD.  And, I've found the web-based collection to have a lot of good images that (so far) have met the needs of all of his projects.

If you are expecting lots of images on CD, this is not for you.  If you want a lot of images easily searchable on the web, this is a great deal."
what is there to really say...it's microsoft office so it's the best lol
"This software works but it really really really slow.  Really really really slow.  Slows my new imac to a crawl and the slowest of antivirus scans I've ever seen.  Just changed over from the PC world and as a creature of habit keep antivirus installed.  All the antivirus authors seem to have free trials except Symantec.  Probably because you'd be really frustrated and not buy the program...  This was the biggest waste of money I've spent on software in a long time.  Two stars since it probably does it's job....if it ever finishes the scan.  So far six hours on a month old computer.

Update:  Well, no longer is it a waste of money.  Talked with their very friendly New Delhi tech support and got a refund.  Bought Intego and though it's expensive, it does the job efficiently."
A friend recommended this program and it was cheaper than Turbotax so I tried it.  I found it very easy to navigate.  I haven't prepared taxes for years so didn't need the detailed Q and A part.  And I like the free audit support included.  Will definitely buy it again next year.
This product does not work at all. Their support is terrible and they will not even answer the phone or emails.
"Probably the best in its class, but still awkward to use and unnecessarily complicated to go directly to an area of interest. Taxes not done correctly. Although interest and penalties assessed were small, getting those letters from the IRS does not inspire confidence in the program."
Excellent product. Very fast and efficient and automatically upgrades in the background. I will definitely buy it again next year.
"No way this should have been released when it was. Many of the new functions did NOT work on arrival and have had 7 major patches ... and some stuff still doesn't work. Awful QC and no excuse for releasing it this buggy. The new ""cloud"" feature still isn't working and is pretty much useless. Best feature is the Mortgage what-if calculator but hardly worth the upgrade. If you don't need it, DO NOT upgrade."
"I downloaded this product & started using it immediately.  The price was the best I found available.  Since ive used TurboTax in the past, all of my personal info transferred easily to the new product."
"Unfortunately, as a previous MS Money user I did not have many alternatives when it came converting my MS Money files to another financial software product. I chose Quicken because of the claim that I could directly convert my .mny files to Quicken. After doing the conversion, I found that many transactions had to be manually adjusted. However, I must admit that the end result was more than adequate.
With regard to the Quicken product, I find the user interface to be unduly cumbersome and inefficient. I am hopeful that I will be able to find another product that will allow me to convert the .qdf files. I also find the reporting functionality lacking in customization capability."
Had to upgrade this year to include stock sales. Great as always!
"I needed this program to design a lofted ceiling attic bedroom suite with multiple dormers and skylights. It did the job spectacularly. I even replicated my entire house, for future design needs. I am a beginner at design, and  picked this up easily.  Highly recommend this program!"
did not have what I need. should have bought 'premier' with more Schedules on it.
"Product Details:  ""Dance Praise With Dance Pad""

In the fine print comments: ""complete.  disc has scratches but plays fine.  no dance mat.""

Well, I am not sure why this was listed in ""Product details"" as coming WITH dance pad.  Also, in the comments, it says ""complete"".  I figured I would be able to go through the motions with or without the pad, but after 30 to 38 ""missed"" steps (because there is no pad), the song is interrupted and unable to continue because they think nobody is there.  Well, I have to say I would not have ordered this if I knew it was necessary to have the pad.  I feel this should not have been advertised ""... With Dance Pad"".

Paid TOO MUCH for something I cannot use."
"This program includes 1,500 Thai words, written in both Thai and transliterated English. The program includes audio, so you can hear how each word is pronounced. The words are divided into categories like ""airport,"" ""changing money,"" ""clothes,"" etc. You can study the words either within those categories, or by adding them to your ""wordbank"" and then studying your wordbank.
If you want to study the words in your wordbank in the form of flashcards, each word in the wordbank will be presented to you in written Thai. When you click on flashcard, the English translation is given, and you have the option of hearing the Thai pronunciation.

There are two aspects of this program that I didn't like. First, the vocabulary selection is terrible. Too much of it is tourist specific. Even if you were using the course to prepare for a trip to Bangkok, you don't need to know the Thai words for ""duty free,"" ""hangar"" and ""boarding gate"" to travel around the country. And that type of vocabulary is worthless for a beginning or intermediate student. What percentage of your daily conversations involve airplane hangars or duty free shops? In short, there aren't enough useful verbs in this program. Second, the flashcards always appear in the same order. So, for example,  if you're studying colors, you will know after you've been through the cards a couple times that green comes after blue, even if you don't actually recognize the Thai word for green.

But, having aired my complaints, I wish I had had a program like this 20 years ago when I was studying Russian, or 25 years ago when I was studying French. Studying Thai vocabulary without audio is almost pointless. So this program provides an inexpensive way to practice reading and pronouncing Thai while building your vocabulary."

"I signed up for Quicken a good number of years ago and was very happy with the product.  Then, I had to make the change to Quicken Essentials but was less than enthusiastic about this lack-luster edition.  I was very happy to see a return to the full version for Mac and am once again very well-pleased."

Also I'd highly recommend that you go to an apple class at an apple store once you see how the movie program works and each of the components of ilife you just might become a convert, such as myself.  I have found this program very useful."
Works great for my needs. Good software
"I started using PSP back when Jasc owned it. It was easy to use, and worked fairly well. After Corel bought it, the program turned to sh|t. The interface was changed arbitrarily, and to make matters worse, it had memory issues with regads to high DPI images of any size larger than 1x1 inch. I went from PSP8 to X7 because of the memory issues, and the interface has changed yet again. Not only that, but I get these annoying ads all the time.

Further, changing the properties on vector shapes is a hit or miss proposition. The properties menu item in the layer pane does NOT allow you to change the border or background color of the shape. Instead, you have to futz around on the canvas and hope you right-click in the right place to be able to select properties in the displayed context menu.

Finally, I've somehow managed to get the app into some weird-aZZ mode that will not allow me to do anything to a vector shape once it's drawn. I'm going to have to UNINSTALL the app and reinstall to get it back to where it should be.

I f*cking hate this program."
"I bought this for my almost 7 year old and played it a little alone first.  I thought the graphics were great, and the games seemed interesting enough... BUT.... I didn't realize there was so little to the game.  My quick peek at it actually was almost to the end of it. Basically there are only 14 games (I think that's right) and once you've played them... its over.  It took my son less than 2 hours to play this game (would have been faster but it was sometimes a bit slow changing screens, and we have a 1gig/Athalon pc.)  He liked it cuz he's goal oriented, and solving the story makes it more interesting to him than the ones where you do tasks for no particular reason.  But ... what now?  A few more hours at different levels and we'll be done with this game...."

"Basically like using the same product from PC.  The Mac iWork programs (eg. Pages, Numbers) are not compatible in many instances (files cannot be uploaded as gmail attachments, for example) so I like this format."
"If you don't have IT support, this is a hard product to use. For families or small offices, there are easier-to-use and cheaper options.

"I am most unhappy with my recent purchase (12/2014)  of Turbotax software.

I orderd the Turbotax ""Deluxe"" as I have for the past several years only to find out
later that I had received something called ""Turbo Tax Deluxe Deductions and Homeowners"" instead.

This software was NOT designed for covering Stocks and Bonds that the Old Deluxe did.
So I had to upgrade to their ""Premier"" program ($ 42.79).

Then I discovered that the Premier upgrade did not include the New Jersey State software
which was included with the old ""Deluxe"" programs, so another $ 32.10 !

So it was $ 42.79 for the original order
  $ 42.79 to upgrade to Premier
  $ 32.10 for the NJ software
Total  $ 110.68 this year, in previous years it was about $ 50 total.

Yes, yes, I know that Turbotax is offering us a $ 25 refund/rebate
because of the public outcry over the money grubbing changes that
they made to their programs for 2015.
They can keep their $ 25 and shove it.
I will never use TurboTax again or order Tax software from Amazon
again either."

"Used to load OS to new 6th generation i5 computer with 16 GB DDR4 RAM and 240 GB SSD with ASUS B150-M motherboard.  Loaded incredibly fast from USB drive without pre-configuration of BIOS.

"I have been a loyal Quicken for Windows user for more than 20 years.  I recently migrated from a Windows system to a Macbook Pro and purchased Quicken 2016 for Mac.  I could not adapt to the complete change in format and was dissatisfied with the Mac version.  My hope is that Quicken will eventually (soon) produce a Mac version more similar to the format I have used for so long.  Had I not become so used to the Windows version I  would have been more adaptable.  More experienced Mac users will probably love the Mac version.  I went back to my Quicken 2015 for Windows in a Virtual Machine on my Mac.  Not an ideal method but will work until the Mac version more closely feels like the Windows version does.  I give 3 stars because Quicken for Mac is still an excellent choice, just not one I can adapt to."
"When I called ScanSoft's customer support I asked them one question.  I wanted to know if PaperPort would allow me to scan in multi-page documents into an Adobe Acrobat 5.0 PDF the same way that ScanSoft's old product Pagis Pro would.  (I am a resigtered owner of the full version of Acrobat 5.0.)  Customer service assurred me that it would do just that.  I received the product, installed it and found that I would have to scan one page in at a time and then combine them later into one document (unlike Pagis Pro used to do).  Doing a little research, I discovered that Adobe Acrobat 5.0 would let me do my scanning like Pagis Pro used to do WITHOUT using PaperPort.  Given the fact that I have other software that allows me to do EVERYTHING else that PaperPort will do (like editing pictures, etc.) I wonder WHAT PaperPort is going to do for me other than cost...?  In one word, FUGEDDABOUTIT!"
"As a student, typing is very important in any class.  Mavis Beacon helped me to increase my words/minute by teaching my fingers the correct positions on the keyboard.  Although it was instant messaging that began my typing experience, this program has improved my performance."
"After looking at many GPS devices in the market. I found Microsoft Streets 2006 with GPS is the best for your travelling. Before deciding what GPS to buy it is important to know how frequently you use GPS. Spending hundreds of dollars on GPS if travelling only 5 times a year is just waste of money. Looking this frequency I bought MS streets 2006 with GPS. The product is real good. I didn't find anyproblem with this and accuracy of details is excellent. It guides till we reach 10-20 yards and that is pretty much accurate unless you are changing lanes in downtown in every 50 yards. The voice clarity is good. If you have FM tramitter then connecting to LAPTOP will ease you hearing part of the gps. this is because as we travel anywhere from 65M per hour it is difficult to hear the laptop voice...

I recommend this product for those who occasionaly go may be 6 -10 times a year."

"I'm currently using Windows Home Server to handle one PC and one Macintosh.

Windows Home Server is incredibly easy to install and use.

I posted around 25 Windows Home Server videos on YouTube. The videos are incredibly popular.

I bought a barebones computer system for my Server PC. The barebones system sold out!

Windows Home Server makes a daily backup of my PC

Windows Home Server allows me to store one copy of my multimedia files, and access them from the Macintosh and PC clients.

Windows Home Server doesn't work with Apple's Time Machine backup feature... but that's ok.

I like the other features that Windows Home Server offers.

We are urged to make the Windows Home Server a ""Headless"" computer, and not access it directly.

Unfortunately, that is not a good idea.

Sometimes Windows Home Server gets an update, and needs to restart.

You need to know when that happens so you can enter your password, etc."
"I used this to create estimates, then it lets you transfer that estimate right to an invoice.

"I will never buy another Intuit product again. I've been using Quicken for almost two decades now and am completely upset with their lack of support for current Quicken users. When QE first came out I purchased it immediately. I quickly found that it wasn't going to work out for me but Intuit said it was a work in process. I figured I'm OK with that and kept it while still using Quicken 2007. Every once in a while I'd check with them and updates to see if it had improved. Never to a point where I could migrate to it. Finally we come to the present where Apple is about to release OS X Lion which will no longer have support for older programs (like Quicken 2007). Intuit still has no plans to include features from the previous version in Essentials nor does it plan on support 2007 with Lion.

In preparation of the release of Lion I've been checking out other applications (iBank, Moneydance). I think I'll be going with Moneydance as it appears it can do everything I am used to in Quicken 2007.

My thoughts regarding Intuit and the Mac OS. They've never had a product that is as robust as their Windows product. Even Quicken 2007 lacks a lot of functionality of the Window counterpart. Quicken Essentials has dropped a bunch more functionality. It appears that Intuit half-heartedly supports its product on MacOS X. Even if you find that QE may do what you need it to I'd still be hesitant. You never know when Intuit will choose not to support that product any longer. I'd definitely recommend looking at the competition. I was able to get Moneydance to work properly with online banking, my loans/mortgage. It was a major PITA converting the data from Quicken to Moneydance as it's not a straight forward conversion."
"After using TurboTax for a decade, I am done. All they do is raise prices and not improve their product. Turbotax was great when there were no alternatives. But now, I could go to H&R Block for free software and support if I need it, for the price of the Turbotax product I need. Turbotax has had years to improve their reporting of difficult items such as MLP filings, but their support has not improved. Their forums are filled with hundreds upon hundreds users with questions about MLP filing but they don't do as much as create a basic FAQ. Their help desk is clueless about such subjects so the user is left to search the internet hoping to piece together a solution. Really, they take our money and don't reinvest into a better product. At this point I'm giving up the struggle moving on."
Does not install correctly. No recourse.
"I really like this software. It includes two programs, Vegas Video Platinum 12 and Hitfilm 2 Express.

I have used Vegas Video for a long time and it is always a winner. I will always give Vegas 5 Stars.

The program HitFilm 2 Express ,which is a seperate program. ( It is the one in this package NOT Ultimate.)
Of course the Ultimate is the one with all the bells and whistle. (Ultimate is an upgrade)

My first impression of Hitfilm Express 2 was, whats the big deal.
But the more I worked with it the better it got.
You can do some really good effects with this program. For example you can make a missle with smoke trailing behind.
Pretty cool. There are lots of other effects you can do.

HitFilm Express 2 gets 5 stars from me and thats because I know when I upgrade to Ultimate I will love it.

The BEST REVIEW for these programs is YouTube.
There are some really great tutorials for both. Most of what I have seen for Hitfilm was the Ultimate version but some stuff you can use with Express and Utimate.

They both have really, really good forums, so you can always get help when you have problems.

The video you are working on in Vegas can be put in HitFilm to do some more editing and add effects, then if you want you can put it back in Vegas and do more editing.

Both programs work really good together. I haven't had any problems with them working together, no lock ups.

Update: I forgot to mention something that may also be helpful. What my computer system is...
I have an i7 4 core processor
12 GB RAM
64 Bit operating system
AMD Radeon HD 6700 series video card.

I had only one issue, and I am sure it is more of a PC problem than a software problem, when I rendered a video clip in HitFilm and played it on windows media player the video and sound were jerky like it was skiping frames, But when I opened it in Vegas it played just fine. Just a heads up in case this should happen to you.

Other than that little problem my PC runs both programs really good."
"have stoke. can't write at much, can't review. please don't asking"
"I work in the IT industry and see many intendances of spy, mal and virus infections. That is why I use Trend Internet security. I have never been infected when using trend. Great product."
easy to install
"My biggest complaint was installation. The package comes with a CD and a card telling you that the preferred mode of installation is to download the software. So I went to the website, logged into my account, entered the long product code from the card, and received a message saying that the software is not compatible with Windows. Nonplussed, I looked at the box several times, saw multiple versions of Windows listed, and tried again. No luck. In fact, the website turned out to be almost useless.

HOWEVER, when I loaded from the compact disc, I had no problems. The program loaded smoothly in just a few minutes and has been working well since then. I have noticed no appreciable slowdown in the computer's performance, and the interface between the program and the user is easy to navigate. All in all, I look forward to a smooth year with this program and will report back with any glitches, problems, or even surprising benefits, should I notice any."
"The program is easy to use. It prevent people to watch your private information. Also, I love its Ad Blocker and Pop-up killer since they block only unwanted content accurately which is different to other software. Finally I love its updating tool (though find out errors sometimes) especially Live Update express. It's really quick and fast. Unlike Mcafee which need me to allow crazy active X control all the time. Its virus scanning tool is quite impressive. Nevertheless, the live support is bad and automatic program control suck which need me to restart my computer. It's aloso resource-hungry program and eat a lot of space in your computer."
"I have never used the guiding hand approach provided by this software, where one it guided through the hell of taxes by answering questions. I like the thrill of filling in the forms on my own. These are the features that I use: transferring last year repetitive tax data to the current year, like name, occupation, that stuff. Being able to dump my categorized Quicken data into the appropriate lines in an appropriate form. Error feed back that is direct yet inoffensive. Forms search on first letter. Running total of how much tax is owed. Simple electronic filing. Being able to download the software and update it before using it. Transferring Federal data to the state form effortlessly. I like he incremental improvements from year to year."
Worked as advertised. It was out of production by Intuit so saved the day.
"PC Matic was very easy to install. I run it weekly to keep my computer clean.
So far, so good. I will update review if there are any changes. I'm a happy user."
"TurboTax delivered as usual, even though I had to upgrade to Premier (for investments).  However, when I finished my taxes, I noticed that TurboTax offered a $25 rebate if I used Deluxe last year.  So even though I initially paid more this year to upgrade, Intuit essentially made up the difference and I think it ended up being cheaper ($55 for Premier/Amazon Prime - $25 = $30).  I think TurboTax is a great value for the price.  Prior to using TurboTax, I had a CPA file my taxes for hundreds of dollars.  Then one year, a friend of mine who is a professor of law in DC was meeting with the US Treasury Secretary who said that he used TurboTax.  I figured that if the Treasury Secretary used TurboTax, it was good enough for me.  I compared TurboTax to my CPA that year and in the end the CPA and TurboTax were within five dollars.  That was the last year I used a CPA."
Great bible to study with. Gives good explanations of versus and has many other tools. Definetely would reccommend!
Great!
It did an excellent job last year!
BEWARE! Would not work on my MAC or PC! Only works with really old computers & old OSs. Returning
"Always the best product available.
Never had a virus I was not notified of, in the 10 yrs. I have relied on this product!"
"Just what I needed.

This review is totally unnecsesary and I do not appreciate this requirement to add required words to the evaluation"
"working with graphics and having to send large files is a big part of my life.
have always relied on Stuffit, but this latest version is absolutely the best.
thanks"
A good buy at the sale price.
"Many of the files are repeats, many more are corrupt.  Most importantly the quality is very poor, I would guess most (80%) are 11.025/8bit/mono.  Too low quality for anything over a school project.  I wouldn't even put them on my desktop."
"Had a picture that we needed to eliminate an innocent bystander out of... well, anyway we had to clean up the perimeter of the shot. Using two different pictures one cannot tell what was done. It didn't take me long to figure out how to use the software. Overall satisfied with the money spent."
"I have both a Mac and a PC. I prefer my PC, but I absolutely love Scrivener. When I saw they had a version available for PC, I had to have it. The program runs pretty much the same as the Mac version, but is a little more clunky. The ""inspector"" does not have as many functions available to you at such easy access. Most of these functions are still in the program but you have to go and find them somewhere else or use hotkeys (for example, the footnotes/annotations feature cannot be found in the inspector in this version).

Likes:
It is Scrivener! Great program, nice to have on a PC

Dislikes:
Some features not as easy to access as in Mac

Bottom line:
Scrivener is an amazing program and my complaints only really apply to people who have used the Mac version. If you have not, then you won't know what I am complaining about and no need to worry."
Great editor it does Everything you will need it to do
it extends play almost endlessly and it gives you many new features for work and industry files.
"First off, if you are looking for software to help you with turn-by-turn directions, I recommend Google Maps or Google Earth, both of which are free.  If you're looking for something a little more robust,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Streets-Trips-2009/dp/B001EHXOFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Streets & Trips 2009</a>&nbsp;might do the trick.  But if you're going to use your software for personal use as opposed to business, you aren't going get a good value out of MapPoint.

That said, for anyone looking for business use, look no further because you won't find a more full-featured software package at this price point.

There are a ton of features and you can try them all by downloading a 60 day trial from Microsoft, but the most important for me are the route optimization and territories & demographic data.  Put simply, route optimization takes a series of stops and maps out the most efficient way to traverse them.  If you do any kind of deliveries, this software will pay for itself by way of saved time and gas.  If you're focused on sales or marketing, the demographic overlays and ability to create territories is easily the best part of this software.

The program isn't perfect, though.  I felt the interface could have been a little more user-friendly.  For example, Google Maps spoiled me for address entry and I would have hoped Microsoft would have caught on.  With Google you can type just about anything- you don't have to worry too much about formatting and can even leave off the city and state because it remembers where your home location is.  This was not so with MapPoint, which was pretty stiff by comparison.

Lastly, I wanted to cover a couple of points mentioned in other reviews.  Some reviewers have pointed out the ""coupons"" feature, which is supposed to look up coupons for businesses along your route or near your destination.  I personally didn't find this very useful.  Many times it either found nothing or a simple Google search found more options.  Also, a few reviewers have talked about the lack of push pins, but I would like to mention that it is VERY easy to add your own icons to personalize the software.

So all-in-all I give MapPoint 4 out of 5 stars.  It's a great piece of software and very reasonably priced for business needs.  It lost a star, though, for not keeping up with some of the user-friendliness of software that's available for free."
I don't use this a lot but it works.
"I downloaded this program the day before my taxes were due. I have bought the CD of the H&R Tax program in past years, but it was cheaper and faster to download. It didn't work. It downloaded, but I could not open it. This was extremely frustrating, so I went to Target and bought the cd, so I could get my taxes done on time, thinking I could get a refund on the downloaded app. When I looked at my e-mail, I discovered that downloads are non-refundable. I will not be doing this again."
"Thanks, Amazon !"
The one I like most
I purchased this game and was very disappointed. I can usually count on Disney for quality but either the games are too hard or to simple. My kids own almost every Disney game for the computer and this one has to be one of the worst. We loved the movie but the game just isn't worth the money.
"I was using a different program that I liked very much, but could not update it.  Started using this 2016 and it has a lot of nice functions. Missing the ability to keep one month showing, rather than 30 days. Maybe it can be done with a setting?? When I change to a month and close the program, it goes back to 30 days, which is not the way I budget. Making your own categories, and the ability to show info in notes is a good feature.
The program opens VERY slowly. Could be my computer, but the other program I opened was automatic.  I didn't chose to go on line, so it shouldn't take so long to open. My only complaint."
"I have been using H&R Block for many years now.  It is a straight-forward program for straight-forward tax returns. I have been trying to research a potential issue related to an K-1 form (final K-1 and associated losses), but I can't seem to figure out how it is reported in the program.  I'm still researching it and may try their help line.

As a final note, I should have waited until after the new year to purchase this program.  I brought the program as a gold box deal just before xmas, but then on Jan 2nd, it's a gold box deal for 27% less than when I brought it as a xmas gold box item. Now I understand why Amazon discontinued their price guarantee program."
"We purchased ACT 3 years ago and startined using it and it has been nothing but a major inconvenience.

As others have noted, the program slows your PC down to a crawl creating very frustrating days. You wait and wait and wait. But there are also many other things that contribute to more frustration.

There are so many bugs in the software that you frequently are forced to re-install and regenerate ""remote databases.""

BUT the most dreaded of all prblems is getting synchronization to work consistantly. You do get it working and very soon in the future, you're out of luck and you have to start the whole setup over again.

And if you think Tech support can help ...they could in theory. However, prepare to wait on hold for 30 minutes at a time. I recently hung up after my call was not taken for 45 minutes. On occasion, I have got through only to be told that there would be a price to be helped; that's right they want you to PAY for a product you purchsed!! This company is outrageous.

I support two different comany's networks and ACT and ACT is loathed by both for the three years they've had it. One of the two is completey abanding it.

For the life of me, I cannot understand how this product is used by so many. And everyone (my colleagues) I talk to have the same issues with the buggy program. all the people that use it cannot understand how ACT still sells.

If you buy it; be prepared to be frustrated!!"
"Norton just keeps getting better.  All of the protection one could want, and this year it's even faster than before.  And as usual, the price is right when you buy from Amazon."
EXCELLENT PRODUCT & SUPPER AMAZON SELLER A+++++
"I don't know what is up with these bozos.  You'd think that after years of customer angry complaints that they would try to do something about the problems.  What is wrong now, I hear you ask?  Let me count the ways it continues to suck.

1) Installation problems.  At best it takes an age to install.  At worst, one gets an error that it can't update.  If you search for the error codes, they know exactly what the problem is and they give steps to fix it ... so why don't they fix it before the user hits the wall?

2) They do try, but still fail at being clear about what you are working on at any moment.  Yes, this is mostly caused by our convoluted tax code, but if an accountant knows what he is working on, Turbo Tax should as well, and make it clear.

3) It simply fails to WORK at times.  I entered data into boxes on a 1099 and it came back and told me I left a box blank ... and SHOWED me the filled in box.  What is up with that?

4) UPDATE:  I am entirely wrong in this.  TurboTax is right, though it could have used a few words to clarify so I'd avoid the confusion.

*** I suspect (but have not completely checked) that there are some glaring errors in the product.  For example: I believe that someone cannot contribute to an IRA if they are covered by an employee pension plan.  (There are probably lots of conditions there so I'm not sure.)  In any case, my wife is covered, she is having her salary reduced by contributions, and yet TT prompts to contribute to an IRA before 04/18, promising that I can reduce taxes by $800+ if I do so.  If this is wrong, I'll be subject to an excess contribution penalty.  So, because of AT LEAST a lack of clarity, I'm going to have to spend some time in research on my own.  Call me silly, but that is what I paid TT to do for me! ***

5) The dreaded ""updating partner info"" hang.  TT is fantastic in that it will go directly to your financial institutions (in some cases) and download the forms directly from them.  Saves a few minutes typing in numbers.  Problem is, EACH TIME you elect that option, it hangs for three to five minutes with that message.  It really is faster simply to type it in yourself.

I will update this review once I finish with it.  (I'm taking a break after my first pass to vent here.  :)"
"Executing substantial text operations of various sizes and styles has made me rather skeptical when it comes to software.  Because I've been largely satisfied with the Office97 version which performs reliably, is adaptable and has an intuitive, predictable interface <--always the preferences of the end user; I haven't been willing to explore anything more recent. I took the risk because the price was acceptable and I needed to push the envelope...so to speak.  The new header format is not entirely pleasing (probably just because I'm not used to it and modification is still under exploration) but I'm very pleased with the flexibilty of the program which allows for my older files to be easily incorporated.  I particularly like the discreet tab design, finding the layout and referencing are well considered.  The formatting presentation and access of the thesaurus, especially the multisourcing and optional support, is excellent; promising a superior fit and finish to my work.  The default coloring is pleasant and the power of the document program is trememdous. This software has exceeded my expectations and soothed my skeptic's brow."
"Sony Movie Studio is terrible. It is not user friendly at all. It also lacks features that are standard in other software programs. For example, I could not find any way to write my video to a DVD that could be played on a DVD player. It also didn't let you select standard resolutions such as 1920x1080p resolution."
I did the automatic install and my computer has slowed downloads drastically.  Any solutions????
i played this when i was little and couldn't find it anywhere and then found it on here! it was exactly like when i used to play it. just wish it worked on macs
"Worked great, booted and installed fresh.  It's nice to get media on a USB drive, rather than a DVD or CD."
"Installed the software on my HP computer running Vista Home Premium Edition.  Went to the web site to update patch.  Plugged one end of the converter cables to my VCR and the other to my HP computer.  Pushed ""record"" on the software menu and ""play"" on the VCR and after playing the tape, the video stored on my computer. Video resolution and audio quality are great. Used nominal CPU processing on my Intel Core Duo CPU.  While I could have used the 3.0 software, I opted to use Windows Movie Maker to create menus, etc. and Windows DVD Maker to burn the DVD."
I have it on all my computers and on my tablet
"I've started using the Hindi version 2 CD and while the lessons seem okay, the software is a bit minimalistic.

Since none of my laptop computers have built in CD drives (to save weight) I've been forced to run this software tethered to a desktop computer.  The vendor really should consider investing a bit of R&D money into making a version that runs on laptops without CD drives.  Maybe a SD card or PCMCIA version.  Be cool if it ran on an iPod.

In the end I found the instruction method too boring and tedious to complete the lessons."
Cheaper than a renewal. Satisfied with the pricing. Glad I made this purchase and was able to save quite a bit of money. Thanks Amazon for another solution in my life!
did not have one note!!!!
This movie I saw on TV. It was very good. I would recommend people buying this DVD to others. My daughter liked this movie also.
Wonderful...
"I bought this at Amazon, got it set up and it offered to update. So I did the update and now the registration code I paid for on Amazon
will not work on this updated version..... I  NOT  A HAPPY CAMPER.... $50 down the drain????"
"Norton lets some Adware/Malware pass through its net, unscathed, such as Conduit Search and a few others. Other than that, it is great."
worked  OK
"For a very minimal amount of money, this visual CD course provides thorough instruction to all three of these basic and essential office tools.  It's not terribly exciting going through the lessons, but they are very thorough and well designed.  I haven't encountered any real problems or glitches, and they definitely provide me with the instruction I have needed.  They demand a fairly serious investment of time -- each tool has about eight different lessons, and each lesson is an hour to an hour and a half.  You can't do all of them at once because they offer too much to absorb if you're really not familiar with the programs.  So you have to spread it out.  But definitely worth it.  I highly recommend, for the price and quality."
My wife uses this for all of our finances. She loves it and has used it for years. She recommends it for everyone.
"No
problems"
Great Program
I need a product for both Home use and business use.  This is the only product I have been able to find.  It was also the best price...
The best free AV there is period!!
Love this! Good deal too!
"I switched from pc quicken 2009 to quicken for mac 2016 because I am learning the Apple OS system in my old age. Love Apple but quicken for mac leaves a lot to be desired. In transferring from quicken to pc the sort capability on the memo field was dropped, a field that I used extensively. Also the report feature for quicken for mac 2016 is limited as if the developers got tired of messing around with it and said ""to heck with it"" and just published what they had up to that point."
"Crashy, quirky, poor work flow...  Don't waste your money !  I removed it from my system and purchased the latest Photoshop Elements which is much more intuitive with much better features.

I do not recommend this software!"
"I've been using TurboTax Business to do my Chapter ""S"" Corporation for about 10 Years. The first time, it took me 3 weeks of spare time to get them done. Now, I can do it in one afternoon. I do not recommend the electronic filing though, as it provides ALL of your tax information to unknown others. I also use the Turbo Tax Basic for my personal taxes. It does everything including my stock portfolio because I don't use the ""guided"" filing. If you're about to try doing your own personal taxes for the first time, get one of the more expensive versions (Deluxe, Premier, etc.) and let the program help you at least the first time."
"I took an image of my computer using Acronis True Image Home 2011 about 6 months ago and I decided to restore my computer.  So, I put in the Acronis CD, booted up the computer, selected the backup image from my external drive and it proceeded to do its thing.  After the restore was complete I restarted the computer and it failed to boot up with an error message: invalid extent GRUB.  I am guessing that it failed because I installed Linux in a separate partition so Acronis somehow trashed the GRUB loader partition.  I did manage to recover my drive after reformatting it and then using Windows 7 restore.  Bad job Acronis.  The only reason I bought this hunk of junk was because it is supposed to work with Linux and Windows.

Other blatant problems with this software:
- If you boot from the CD it will automatically boot into Windows after 15 seconds.
- After restoring or working from the CD there is no option to shutdown, you are forced to restart."
"I realize that my review is not about this product, but I think it is relevant to potential purchasers of Avanquest products.  I do not know anything about this particular program, but have had considerable difficulty with Avanquest as detailed below.

I purchased My Ultimate Organizer 7.0 via download and subsequent key.

I am not making this up - the product displayed a message in Serbo-Croatian telling me the key had expired.

Four hours later with Technical Support and the problem is still not resolved (despite erasing the program, reinstalling, trying different keys, searching the Windows Registry, etc).  It takes a full hour on hold to get a technical support representative and at the conclusion of the last session, I was told to contact Customer Service for a CD copy in the hopes that that would resolve the issue.  Now Customer Service tells me Technical Support must send me the copy, although Technical Support says otherwise.  I am out $30 for a program that is at this point, totally useless, and left adrift by Avanquest who has my money and refuses to help me.

I would purchase Avanquest products with extreme caution.  If you have a Technical Support issue, you will have to wait a minimum of 60 minutes on hold (no 800 number), and then get fairly substandard service after that."
"I've been using the streets & trips package for a while, and was excited to see that 2004 had finally come out. I decided to go ahead and try it out and see what was wonderfully new and improved. So I went though the install process, and launched it for the first time with anticipation...
My thoughts chronologically: ""Hmm, new spash screen.. Yay, I'm in. Ok.. whats new? Um.. (click click click) where's the new stuff? I wonder if there is a versions.txt...nope. Maybe they fixed that one route bug.... (crash) nope. ARGH! Wait, is this 2004? Maybe something happened, and it left 2003 on my system... Lets see.. (Help->about) No ""2004"" there... Well, it did have that new spash screen. WHAT DID THEY CHANGE?!""
I was so depressed to see so little changes. They didn't incorporate any kind of new support for waypoint files like GPX like I was hoping they would, they didn't fix the bugs i was hoping for... In fact, I'm still not positive they made ANY changes except for the spash screen.
Bottom line is this: If you have 2003, keep it. Don't waste your money. If you don't have anything this is a great piece of mapping software that you should definately check out."
"New in Box, unopened with plastic wrap. Does contain: two cd-rom / DVD's, (32 Bit and 64 Bit) and unique Windows product Key (code).

Great learning tool. It has helped me greatly in communicating with people in my tour areas. I would recommend it for anyone wanting to speak French fluently.
"When I first began downloading this program I did not know how I should install it or how much memory it used. I phoned tech support and picked this poor young man's brains. He answered every question I asked patiently and politely. He even walked me through some basic tools in the program. I am impressed!

  The software has hundreds upon hundreds of pre-made scrapbook pages for photos to be inserted, a heap of quality graphics, and these cute balloons you can add text to!! This is so easy to use that after 1 hour of playing with this I had printed half a dozen scrapbook pages!

  PEOPLE.....THIS IS A QUALITY PRODUCT!!!"
I have been using PC Matic for a few weeks now. My computer is running better and is virus free. I have installed it on my other laptops and I'm finding it to be very useful. I recommend this to anyone with a PC.
"Bought laptop today.  Very first download after very first search was QuickBooks Pro from what appeared to be a valid source.  Virus devoured the laptop.  I used google for remedies unsuccessfully.  I called McAfee support.  What a JOKE!!!  I talked to 4 different people.  I'm not certain which one was the least help.  Google was honestly of more assistance.  The 4th person actually tried to tell me that is not a virus and is only a third party pop up but he could assist with it removal for a fee.  Um... No it's not.  When you sign in and get a totally blue screen within 10 seconds, it's a virus.  I finally was able to get the scan to run in safe mode but it found no issues.  AVG and AVast are free and much better."
IT WORKS GREAT!
"I needed a copy of Quattro Pro which was old enough to correctly read WQ1 files, but new enough to write excel files. This software meets those minimal criteria. However, it won't run on my Windows 7 computer and one of my  Windows XP computers. It is buggy and unreliable. A reminder of why WordPerfect has been dying. Don't but this software unless you have some desperate special need, like I did."
"I have used Quicken for over 15 years and believe it is a great product.  Recently, however, I have been disappointed with their newest releases.  Quicken 2013 had an issue where copied transactions duplicated every split entry contained in it.  This created a lot of noise and busy work cleaning up my most common transactions.  That issue was not fixed in the 2013 version so I upgraded to 2014.  Everything worked great for the first two weeks at which time Intuit pushed out an update/release.  Now I cannot access my main account to enter transactions because the system ""crashes"".  I am unable to enter any new transactions.  I have contacted the company and they are aware of the issue.  No time has been given for a fix and my bills, transactions are piling up with no solution short-term in sight."
I was a Microsoft Money user for many years because it was so easy to use.  Quicken Starter Edition is even better!  A perfect checkbook for a busy person.  Lets you know at a glance what you are spending money on.  I would highly recommend.
"WORKED GREAT - saved FROM DISASTER, thanks to this product..."
"I'm probably the last of those Dinosaurs that did their own taxes, & since I knew I was going to have a different type of situation I figured I'd try a software program & finally decided on H & R Block. Well...........for the Fed it went easy. The state ( California ) also went that way until the check portion, then it seemed I got stuck in some kind of error loop that I could never figure out but finally escaped. So next year I'm not sure if I'll use this again, try Turbo Tax or go to a brick & mortar place."
It did not come with a CD.
I was unable to upload data from prior edition.
"If you have important financial data do not use quicken

I have used Quicken since the early 90's even found early software glitches for which I have received 2 T-Shirts as Thank-you.

I have always updated to new version  Quicken 2014 is really defective.  I have spent over 10 hours trying to fix the problem - 2 hours with Bank of America.  No luck.  The fact there is as good as no quicken support - the software is dangerous and undependable.

Shocking!

Cons:
No customer support - write an email and the community might answer - no way to get support
Poor connection with bank information - Direct connect works sometimes  not consistently"
"The recipient did not let me know how she liked it, but since she asked for it and didn't send it back, I gave it 5 stars."

1. Finds 131 errors, but will only fix 4 (must buy full version!). SHEESH!

2. Buy full version with 20% off coupon (3 computer lic, for only $9.95 more- their web site).

3. Does NOT remove left/overs..., from old uninstalled pgms. (Fix-it Utilities ""6"" safely did- read my review).

4. Then they only support updates... for 1 year- auto-renew! RIP-OFF!

I got a refund, and will NEVER use them again!"
Very good piece of software for Elementary School aged students.  Easy to use format for all ages. Good in the classroom for home schooling.
Alles Bestens. Gerne wieder
Very satisfied with the product. Needed to update as my system crashed and needed to load. Quick service no pun intended.
Arrived promptly. Installed easily.  I've had several versions of this program and I like it.  Remember to select your printer on the print interface to save some confusion.
"This program is totally useless. Here are my reasons:
.
1. The interface is confusing.
.
2. The program produced errors in the image file. As a result, the program crashed when resurrecting my boot partition. . . . I tried again with the same results."
"Office 365 new install or renewal license.  Great price at $84.00 for the year. I changed over to the yearly renewal about 3 or 4 years ago when it came out.  For $84.00 you can install on 5 computers/devices.  I have installed on my laptops, desktop, iPad and my roommate's devices.

Comes with all the components of Microsoft Office and provides updates on an as-needed basis (usually about every 30 days).

Highly recommended if you need Outlook, Word, Excel, Access, Publisher, etc."
"This program makes it pretty easy to prepare bulk mailings. But if that's the main reason you're buying it, you need to know that you'll need to buy it again every year. The zip-sorting data needs to be updated each year, and the program won't allow you to process a bulk mailing if it's been more than a year since your last update. And the ""update"" actually consists of buying the program all over again. It works fine, but you need to know what you're getting into."
"I wish it could repair damaged partitions.  otherwise it fits the bill.
stays on the desktop to remind you that it wants you to feel protected."
excellent on time
"I have read many reviews good and bad (mostly bad) on this operating system. I now have 3 pc's running win 8.1 and I love it. 2 of those are touch screen laptops and 1 is a non touchscreen desktop pc. Even on my desktop pc windows 8.1 is very easy to run, i love the app store I love the start screen and the feel to windows 8.1 is perfect for me. Don't be scared yes they removed the start button but hey you  can still access everything quite easy you just have to learn. Now just so you know i am not a windows fanboy, i love linux (bodhi distro), and i enjoy mac os as well.. All in all i would recommend this OS the only windows 7 that compares to this is windows 7 ultimate.."
great product.
does not work with windows 10.  Bummer
"The product is consistent with Quicken's past versions.  Easy to use and very reliable.  My old data imported, seamlessly.  I was impressed with the ease of downloading from Amazon.  No issues at all!"
I like the way it works in the background to protect my PC.
"The concept is great. The idea to promote coding and learning how to develop coding skills through games kids actually play is awesome. However, since purchasing this, the kids have had to deal with random crashes and an expired course.

You buy such an expensive course and after a year, my kids aren't on it every day and they have homework, etc, the course expired. They will give you an additional ""30 day extension"" but after that, you have to pony up some more cash.

Not worth it in my opinion. I have used professional learning websites like Udemy and others and I can still access years old courses without having to repurchase them. Once you pay money for something, you should have access to it as long as you have an account. 180 dollars is a lot for a course."
"Outstanding product & price. Let me start at the top; delivery 3 days not 5, was del on a Sunday.
Put the disk in (32 bit) went from Vista Home to Windows 8 in just about 40-50 min.
Next was the updates & that took a little longer (aprox. 60 min.) as there was 165 of them to download & Inst.
Next was downloading & inst from the App store of the 8.1, took about 90 min.
Works great & is sure faster than Vista.
Kudos to you Amazon IMO you hit a winner on this one."
Great Spanish translation software.  You can translate a document from Spanish to English and vice versa without being chained to the internet.
"Turbotax was easy to install, use and prompted me to explore all possible deductions. I would highly recommend it as a user friendly efficient way to prepare your own taxes."
"even after I installed this, my computer keeps telling me that my Norton subscription has expired - annoying"
"What exactly does ""Specially defined for INDIANS"" in the description mean?
And their website got blocked by Norton (see attached pic)"
"Here are the basics:

* Captures video and photos from your hard drives, video input (camcorder, vcr, dvd, digital cam, etc.), tv tuner cards, all the normal stuff here. One highlight is that the software will accept both NTSC and PAL format input without issues - so feel free to share those videos with friends around the world.
* Has a full suite of special effects that you can add to your presentation, and when I say full suite, I mean a LOT. Hundreds of transitions, overlays, titles, and effects.
* Output options are vast - it's not just about writing it to a flat video file, you can send it back to a camcorder tape, mobile devices, youtube*, DVD and HD DVD, and more. It comes with all the expected menuing options as well (to create menu's on your DVD splash screen).

Here's what I like:
* File support can't be beat. No more limits to mpg, avi, wmv like you get in things like Windows Movie Maker*, this program pretty much reads everything including Quicktime* and Flash*, and as I mentioned before, PAL format too. This was a big win for me recently because I was putting together a video presentation that included video from the US and from India. Ulead was the ONLY program I had that would read the files without having to convert them first.
* Effects are vast. If you are used to some of the cool transitions you get in Windows Movie Maker* you're familiar with things like flips, rolls, slides, shatters, etc. Ulead steps it up a notch with 3D flips and spins, colour masks, clock style transitions, texture effects, peels, pushes, rolls, slides, stretches, wipes, and more. It even comes with a set of pre-installed flash animations that plug right into your movie or overlay on an existing slide.
* Audio options are significantly enhanced. Not only can you put it into waveform view, but you can dynamically change the volume and direction of the audio. These features are like Audacity* or Cakewalk* - you can drag and drop volume changes and even shift audio to left and right channels. This was pretty incredible to me and not something I've seen in any other movie maker software. Voice track is also available but not something I have used since I use pre-packaged audio for my movies.
* Setting exact time for a slide. In other programs it's difficult to set a slide to display for an exact time down to the split second. Ulead makes this easy with a detail page for each slide that you can configure timeline and other functions. I use this all the time. This detail page also offers dynamic pan/zoom and resizing of the image you're using, and if it's an image, instant colour correction. Very powerful. If it's a video you can reverse it, change the speed, split the audio, and dynamically trim the clip.

What bothers me:
* Limited TITLE templates out the box. The templates they provide seem pretty hokey, but you can do some level of customization and then save your new template (I just wanted more out of the box) - the other issue here is that you have to create a blank colour box (with associated duration) and overlay the title on it. This is very different from other tools that will automatically create a title slide for you. Titles are very important to me, as well as credits, which this tool doesn't have out of the box.
* Adding transitions and effects is clunky and time consuming. Drag and drop takes a while because of the distance between the transition and the timeline. Additionally, you can not highlight multiple sequences and apply a transition to each one en masse. In other words, if you want the same transition between 10 slides, you have to do it 10 times.

Overall Rating: 4 of 5, with 1 point removed for minor usability issues and insufficient title templates out of the box.

Summary: One of the most powerful video editing and movie creation tools I have used. Easily beats competitors like Roxio* and Windows Movie Maker*, although, for free movie creation, WMM* does provide a lot of functionality. For professional movie creation and the flexibility this program offers in input and output options, I'm very impressed.

* Product names are copyrights and trademarks of their respective companies."
Software isn't bad. It's actually quite usable. But you'll feel like a circus animal after jumping through all of the hoops to get the software registered. If you have to wipe out the machine and reinstall the OS after a virus or change machines then you're almost better off forking out the money for a new copy. My time isn't worth more than the time required to deal with trying to get in touch with someone and get the software reregistered. 3 stars for doing what it claims to do reasonably well but 0 stars for treating the customer like a degenerate criminal when trying to get the program registered to work.
"If you are looking for a well designed, effective, easy to use, reliable research tool/dictionary for your computer look elsewhere because The Pop-Up Oxford Dictionary of English is pathetic.

Avoid this sad sad product. It is completely useless."
Great program!  I've used quite a few programs for graphics...Corel painter...Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator...This is one of the best for character creation and is perfect for Manga generation.
The item came on time and in the condition stated on the site. I just finished setting up my new computer and started using my Outlook.  I love it...
Upgrade was a smooth & uneventful process this year.
Not worth your money.  It's marginally better than the built-in version that comes with windows NT series.
"Been using Norton for over 10 years, never a problem. Blocks both web and email attacks and redirects."
I tried to install it but I got an error message and was instructed to call a toll free number for help. A very rude guy with an Indian accent started pushing me to buy network protection worth at least 100 dollars for a start. Obviously I was not interested and he hung up. I may have missed the return deadline and now I am stuck with a piece of useless garbage.
"Bye, bye, Power Pivot in Excel.

If you are a working professional looking for a copy that is usable for the family and serviceable enough for you or your kids to learn or brush upon Business Intelligence approaches in Excel, forget about this version AND skip the university version.

Power Pivot used to be free as an add-in for all under Office 2010.  Those days are no longer.  Only Excel Standalone and Business Pro subscriptions may use PowerPivot.

These new subscription based limitations will ultimately drive consumers away.  Already, many schools across America are flocking to Google Drive and Apps.  We will not renew with MS."
"My wife will be the primary user of this program.  She has limited but nicely improving computer skills and has found many graphics programs to be wholly unsatisfactory.  At first, she didn't like this either.  But with more use, she found it to be fairly easy to use and she was able to get better results than previous programs.  Her primary use is for scrap booking projects.

Having gotten fairly proficient with Photoshop Elements 8 (and improving on 9), she doesn't use this for significant manipulation of photographs.  But for someone who still finds PSE (let along full Photoshop) intimidating, this is a reasonable place to start.

With reference to the tutorials, she moved from not liking the program at all, to one she started to learn on, and expects to use in the future.  There are some easier programs, and there are more complex ones.  This seems to be about in the middle in terms of complexity, and documentation doesn't help things a lot.

Given some of the other very poor choices in relatively entry-level software of this type, this isn't bad.  If you can find a trial version (don't know if they make one), I'd spend some time with it during a trial period first before committing money.  And regardless of how you do get it, expect to take some time learning from the documentation and tutorials (a pet peeve of mine - mediocre documentation)."

"The Good:

*Doesn't hog your resources.
*Easily identifies unsafe websites.
*Great for novice and expert users alike.

The Bad:

*A more extensive user manual would've been nice.

The Bottom Line:

A great program that easily identifies unsafe websites.  You install it and forget it, as you will not hear a peep from this program, as if it wasn't there.  You can see the results just by going to Google.  It uses a simple green, yellow and red system to identify the website.  As you hover over a link, it will give you a more extensive review of the website.  I'm an avid surfer and even I was amazed how some of the website I used to think are safe are not necessarily safe.  This is even a great tool for parents to educate their kids about net safety by explaining to them not to click on anything that McAfee marks as a suspect.  Overall, McAfee Site Advisor Plus is a great addition to any PC."
"I liked it at first.  Then I was advised that my operating system was out of date, so I could not play the music.  I upgraded my operating system to Yosemite and I still cannot make it play."
"DO NOT DOWN LOAD THIS.
It corrupted my commuter.
I don't know why Amazon even has this.
Amazon please remove this."
"TurboTax is a fine program, but there are too many worksheets and the instructions are not very clear.  Ex: you know the dollar amount for car usage and try to enter it on the tax form, you can not.  You must go to the worksheet and fill in the blanks there or you can make the direct entry, if you can locate the proper key stroke."
It works well but it's a pain to use when having to check out through Amazon if you don't have a Kindle & very difficult to return before the due dates if using a public library forum.
Works well. A good way to work on your PC and peruse your Kindle Library.
"I use this on a daily basis.  Easy interface, great videos in many formats.  Screencaps are splendid."
I was in a jam.. I needed it asap.. log on to their web site.. Amazon was the only company that would allow u to download .and purchase this product lower than the other company....
"Could not get the Windows 8.1 Pro Pack to Install using the add new features instructions that came with the product key that I bought from Amazon.com .
I spent over an hour on the phone with Microsoft and , let one of the
support guys have access to my computer only for him to tell me that I
needed to schedule an appointment with a stage 2 technical support rep. and
that it would be Friday July 24,2015 before they could even work on the
problem. So, I went ahead and scheduled for 9 to 11 am Friday. When I got
off the phone I was disappointed that I couldn't get the windows 8.1 pro
pack installed. But, I kept thinking about it and went on line and found a
few reviews of people that have had the same problem with it saying that
the product key was good but, the program say that there was a problem and
to contact the website for support. Then I found a review that one customer
had the same problem but, he was able to uninstall the Mcafee anti-virus
and tried it again and the 8.1 pro pack installed fine. So, I decided to
give it a try. I uninstalled my McAfee All-access security program and
followed the instructions that I printed for the product key and low and
behold it worked. Everything installed like it was supposed to. And, I
reinstalled McAfee security and activated my Windows 8.1 Pro with Media
Center. Evidently, the security program wouldn't let me upgrade without
uninstalling it first."
"I was extremely disappointed with Norton Internet Security 2003.  I expected better from Norton, their products are usually decent.

This software does not do what it's supposed to do for content filtering.  It blocks at best 60% of the web sites that it should.  And it lets about 40% of the hardcore porn sites through.  Do not use this product for content filtering.

Parents this could lead you to believe your children are safe, when in fact they are not.

Two thumbs down, I wasted the money."
Serves Our Small Church Library Well!!
"I've got to say this is my second year using this product.  I had used Turbotax business for a number of years and switched over last year to give it a try.  On Turbotax, you have to purchase a separate personal and business editions if you have anything more than a sole proprietorship.  Given that I have two LLC's I made the switch to save money.  How hard could it be since H & R Block is a huge tax company.

The transfer of information was seamless last year (from prior Turbotax data) and this year (from last year's H&R Block data).

That's about where the ease of use goes.  It seemed to be completely non-intuitive and I had never had trouble with Turbotax.  Also, I have relatively small LLC's that don't have much complication.  Turbotax had always easily handled the taxes and it took me at least 10 times longer on the H&R block software.

I decided to give it another go for two reasons.  First, I figured maybe I was just used to the old software and that's why it was difficult.  Second, the cost once again got me to go with H&R Block.  Third, and this is probably the most important.....Time makes the pain feel much less intense.  I had completely forgotten how much time, energy, blood sweat and tears this software had caused me.  I won't be tricked again.  The pain won't go away.  And if it does.  I've set tasks to start popping up my multiple computers, phones etc. on 1/1/15.  ""DO NOT FORGOT. DO NOT BUY H&R BLOCK TAX SOFTWARE."""
Reasonably prices. Got ab old g5 tower for free. Was running very old opperating system. Gave my Mac the upgrade it needed.
"Good product lightweight, Quick and thorough scan, not a resource hog."
"I used Diet Power off and on for a couple years without having to pay.  When I finally decided to pay and keep it, I had nothing but problems.  Spoke for some time on the phone with a tech who assured me they NEVER have this much trouble, but he couldn't even fix my troubles with remote access to my computer.  The more they ""fix"" this program, the worse it becomes.  That said, if you don't have problems, it can be a great tool, but I've found several FREE programs out there that are at least as good.  All tools work for those those use them. Just google free calorie counters; if you're serious, any one of them will do the job."

"Message in a Haunted Mansion is the third Nancy Drew game, and far superior compared to the first two. This game sets the standard to what the majority of Nancy Drew games contain, and is the first to use the formal ""Nancy Drew case formula"". It is this game that employs several aspects that become rules for future cases, such as ""there must always be four suspects"" and ""there must always be a long-lost treasure"".

Rose Green, a friend of Hannah Gruen's (Nancy's housekeeper), has recently purchased a Victorian mansion in San Francisco, California. She and her friend and co-owner, Abby Sideris, hope to turn the place into a bed-and-breakfast by the following month. However, several peculiar accidents have been getting in the way of the renovations. Hannah asks that Nancy go over to help complete the renovation, while secretly performing an investigation to find out just what's causing the accidents. Nancy soon finds herself in an old mansion that's filled with a dark past, unexplainable shadows, ghostly voices, and unexpected accidents that could happen at any moment. Is an inhabitant of this manor trying to scare everybody away, or are the restless spirits of the previous owners truly back to haunt the place?

The plot used in this game is phenomenal, and a great idea for Nancy's first ""haunted house"" mystery. Even though the criminal in this game isn't a killer, it still holds on to the scare factor that the first two held, and the danger does become life-threatening at times. The game itself does get pretty scary, and all of the references to the history of California and China that were employed in the plot were very well-integrated.

I will come out and say this about the plot: the ending does become very predictable if one pays attention closely. The location of the ending, the history of the Valdez family (the family who originally owned the manor), the culprit, and his/her intentions all become rather obvious. This is a slight downside, but regardless, all of these aspects of the plot were perfectly executed.

Even though this is only the third game, the quality of this game rivals (and usually even goes beyond) most of the modern games. There are still chores that need to be done and puzzles to solve, but Nancy doesn't spend more time doing chores than investigating or performing puzzle after puzzle after puzzle like she does in several of the more recent games. This game has the perfect blend of sleuthing, puzzle-solving, and chores.

The graphics in this game might show the age on occasion, but they're still rather nice, and almost as good as graphics in a modern game would be. The manor is beautifully detailed, and all of the ghostly haunts that are seen with the eye are wonderfully animated. The character designs are a little more smooth and realistic than the ones in the previous game, now looking like a cross between Barbie dolls and actual human anatomy.

The characters were casted wonderfully, and they were all well-integrated into the story. Rose Green, the owner, is the frustrated woman who spent her entire life savings into the house. She's very determined to stick with the place, but is starting to get discouraged. Abby Sideris is her eccentric business partner, who believes in ghosts and all sorts of supernatural phenomenon. At one point in the game, she even hosts a sance to contact the spirit haunting the house. Charlie Murphy is a young man who's currently employed to help with the renovations. He seems young and inexperienced, but is actually very knowledgeable and is studying history at the local community college. Louis Chandler is an antique dealer about Rose's age, and he's helping the others find some good authentic dcor to keep the traditional Victorian feel while renovating the manor into a B&B.

One wonderful aspect about the cast in Message in a Haunted Mansion that definitely deserves mention is the perfect choice for the culprit. It's not quite like the previous game, Stay Tuned for Danger, in which Mattie, Rick, Dwayne, Lillian, Bill, and Millie all have solid motives to send the threats to Rick and could very well be the culprit at the end. There's only one character in this game that would seem to profit well from performing these acts of vandalism around the house, and I cannot see any of the other suspects being the culprit in the end.

The music in the game was perfect. It made an already very frightening house seem even more haunted. There wasn't a single track that felt out of place, and they ranged from slightly eerie to downright terrifying. The Chinese music heard in Nancy's bedroom complimented the dcor as well, as her room is full of old Chinese furnishings.

Message in a Haunted Mansion has brought the Nancy Drew games from sub-par, old school fun to true accomplishments in the history of adventure gaming. From this point forward, the Nancy Drew games have a tendency to be amazing. Despite the age, this beautiful game full of ghostly frights remains in my top ten favorite Nancy Drew games of all time."
"The stars say it all.  Had trouble with it within the first ten minutes of using it.  Had to wait for way too long for tech help over the phone.  Couldn't get help online because it locked up my BRAND NEW Toshiba laptop, then the survey they sent me by email to find out how satisfied I was with tech help was in Spanish!  Also, I thought I bought a product that I believed had state filing fees included with the price but no-o-o-o-o-o.  Back to taxact next year."
GRAR for downloading music and organizing it.

"The Good:

* A wide array of tools and scanners, as well as firewall and virus protection
* Gamer Mode/Laptop Mode customizes your experience
* Optional online back-up tool
* 2-YEARS/3 PCs subscription makes this a great value

The Bad:

* With the in-your-face alerts, it feels clunky at times
* File Vault feature is cumbersome

The Bottom Line:

A great protection from BitDefender that is also a great value as you get not one, but 2 YEARS of protection for up to 3 PCs.  While the protection is very powerful, it could feel clunky at times when it warns you something minor needs to be adjusted.  The File Vault feature is a great addition to this suite.  However, it makes you scratch your head at times.  Instead of simple folder drag and drop feature, it insists on making a vault with an assigned letter and size, following by asking which file(s) you want to put in, which makes the whole process feel cumbersome.  However, that does not take away from the fact that the overall protection you get is very powerful."
"I am now grafted into the modern world of MS Office 2010 - but I miss Office 2000 - it is easy to use and understand - not because of the years using it but because the system is logical.  It is so simple that a grandmother can follow it!
BUT I had to upgrade because the world did."
"I have spent 26 days now and even though they promised a solution they don't have one.  They don't even know their own Roxio drivers.  The support code first of all was never sent to me.  Then after many emails I finally got support.  Even though my system meets all their requirements I keep getting the blue screen of death. I have never gotten this on this computer only previous ones.

Don't waste your time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"It does the job, simply and effortlessly."
Works great.
I have used Norton 360 for years now and it is a really good product. I would recommend this pc protection to anyone.
"I've been a Norton customer for years and like the protection they provide. But I always had to contact their customer support, which is excellent by the way, to install the new software or activate or something. Each and every time something would not work the way they said it would - until now. I got all three (I bought the 3 device update) down loaded, installed and activated in about an hour while talking on the phone. I hope they continue making it easy."
i highly recommend this program if you want to speak the same Spanish as the native Spanish speakers
"I purchased this copy of Windows 7 because a CD copy of the software was not provided with the new DELL XPE 8700 I purchased.
I have used every version of DOS and Windows and my favorites are DOS 3.2, Windows XP and now Windows 7.  Windows 8 is a bigger screw-up than ME was.  After I purchased this copy I found it at COSTCO for 35% less. Oh well, I still love it even if it does have almost 1,000 windows installed updates in the LOG."
"HAPPY WITH ORDER, ARRIVED ON TIME AND PROGRAM WORKS GREAT. I HAVE USED THIS PROGRAM FOR YEARS THE QUALITY JUST IMPROVES WITH TIME"
"I have no idea why this has such bad ratings. Not gonna lie, I was really sketched out by al the bad reviews but decided to purchase anyways. Im so glad i did.  I purchased this item, used the link that was provided in the product description, made a microsoft account, downloaded the installer (took maybe 15 min), then opened and it downloaded within 3 minutes. After that, i was able to use microsoft office immediately. Super fast, super simple. I bought the download version, not the key card.

"New issues and this stuff hangs... READ FORUMS ON INTERNET

Now owned by Nokia and they have cancelled tech support. No mention of the hang problem on their FAQ's.....  Wait until they get their act together"
This is a very friendly and high use program. It is easy to maneuver and has applications for any use!
Solid protection for internet....some problems with identifying and blocking intrusions but otherwise a good product
I have bought this every year for 8 years and never have had a problem with my computer.  It does a great job.  I highly recommend it.
"I installed Drive Image 5.0 on a Windows XP machine and upgraded from Powerquest's Web site. I followed the User Guide, which is somewhat vague and may be difficult to follow for the inexperienced user. After I used Drive Image to move all files to a new drive, the computer would not boot. I was wise enough to create the boot disk which allowed me to reactivate the original drive. After calls to tech support, which cost me several dollars, they were not able to help me make it work. This went on for about a month. They wrote up a trouble report for their Testing department. After another month, they finally said that they could not resolve the problem. Customer service agreed to refund the purchase price but not pay for shipping or my phone expenses. I think they would have a good product here but they are not fully ready for Win XP."
"I've been using QB for Windows for a few years and recently bought a Mac. QB for Mac is like a watered down version of QB for Windows.  Much more basic and doesn't have the same helpful ""views"" that the Windows version has.  Still easy to use and works great for what I need.  I would recommend it to others."
Wonderful anti virus to use on the computer
i was charged the full price of 49.95 with no $20 coupon inserted.
I found out later that I also need window 7 CD in order to install it. It is better to do bootcamp. don't buy this.
handy
"I did the PC Download.  At first I was upset, because after I downloaded it it said 15 day trial.  I was thinking that cant be right, but after you check your email, and open it from Amazon purchase, and put in your key code it quickly updates to 366 days of protection.  Not sure if it did this, because we had Norton stored on the computer before, but it was expired.  So far so good."
I downloaded the product and setting it up was a breeze! Photoshop Elements is wonderful to work with.
Terrible design. Then need to get everything together.
Is this actually your content to sell? This looks like the same materials that was published in the official learning Smoke book.
"I have only used an earlier version of MapPoint and even then for only in a strictly direction-finding capacity. I understood the data mapping functionality of the product but that was never a feature I intended to use. MapPoint 2009 seems to go one better than that earlier version in refining both those features I like and use (ie. direction and route finding) and those which I have less use of.

From a usability standpoint, this interface is intuitive and easy-to-use. For me, there were no problems with moving around the map interface and zooming in to whatever I was interested with either the mouse or keyboard. The various features for route planning is as good as any other on the market today and as this is my primary focus, I'm functionally happy with MapPoint 2009. With the ""optimize trip"", MapPoint 2009 helps me make the best use of my time, especially when I am geocaching when I have to hit caches in several different areas. In that regard, I find it handles off-road situations rather poorly, but that's understandable. With features like being able to create what they call a ""Drivetime Zone"", you can find subtle and cool ways to use your maps. Drivetime Zones will select and show you what you can reach within a set amount of time from a particular center point.

Export and import of data is simple and easy with the Import Data Wizard that automatically understands what kind of data  you're importing (of course, if it contains addresses!) and then sorting graphically for data. Having direct, in-program access to demographic information must make Real Estate agents drool in analyzing their information. Using the Data Mapping Wizard (love those wizards, don't you?) makes doing such things easy.
I particularly like the ability to insert maps into other Microsoft products, especially the Office suite such as (especially) PowerPoint presentations. I'm going to give this product four stars because I think it should include at least a simple GPS device for the price."
Perfect
"I HAVE HAD THIS SOFTWARE FOR THE PAST 7 YEARS AND I AM HEARTBROKEN THAT IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS VISTA AND WE JUST BOUGHT ALL NEW COMPUTERS. I HAVE MADE HOLIDAY COLLAGES, INVITATIONS, PHOTO CHRISTMAS CARDS, BIRTHDAY CARDS, FAVORS, MY SON'S VARSITY BASEBALL YEARBOOK, MY DAUGHTER'S SCHOOL YEARBOOK, I CROPPED AND PRINTED 1,000'S OF 8X10'S FOR MY SON'S COLLEGE BASEBALL TEAM, AND ENJOYED IT MORE THAN I COULD EVER TELL YOU. NOW I AM TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING TO TAKE ITS PLACE AND SO FAR, NOTHING. IF YOU ARE NOT PLEASED WITH IT, YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING WRONG!!!!"
"Awesome! Love it, fast and timeley delivery!"
Didn't know it was a download but works just as good
Didn't help me at all
"Everything downloaded and worked perfectly, just don't know why it is treated as a purchase."
"I would probably love it if I could find it.  Am having problems, and it is not your fault.  The customer rep had to walk me through the down load process and now I can't find it anywhere."
"Should have read the reviews and product information more closely as I was extremely disappointed to find this version didn't have Outlook.  Had to work with an independent tech support company to find a work-around in order to access all of my email accounts. Rest of the programs, Word, etc. work fine."
"The Garmin was hugely helpful. I don't know how anyone could navigate the country without a GPS! But there were certain cities, smaller ones, that it did not know its way around very well. It directed us to go down several one-way streets the wrong way... And also landed us in the middle of a ""restricted traffic"" area which may land us a ticket for $150 Euros if they caught our license plate on the video cameras. Ouch!!"
"I've been using this for a couple of weeks now. Like everything about it, but make sure you save at every step. You still may have problems, but at least you stand a chance to recover. I have yet to get all the way through printing a card without it crashing at least once. Sometimes it corrupts the file you were working on, so even if you DID save it, it may or may not be recoverable.
The interface is nice and all, but it's very frustration to take an hour to make a card that SHOULD have taken 5 minutes."
"Horrible software would be awesome if it actually worked. Crashes at least once every 2 minutes. Takes 30-40 seconds for anything and everything you do. Nudge an object, that's 30 seconds. Save, that's 30 seconds. 3D view does not work on anything other than a bare 4 walls - any objects added will completely stop 3D view from rendering.
I work in I.T. and it takes a lot for me to say this, but this is by far, without a doubt, the most awful software I have ever had the displeasure of using. Amazon needs to allow 0 stars!"
Sent it back for refund
"Until recently, I had been a longtime user of what was once Paint Shop Pro, now renamed PaintShop Photo Pro X3. I was hoping Corel had fixed the bugs in Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 when it released this new version. But it didn't.

Instead, the company seems to have added a feature here and there for marketing purposes and stayed with the same set of problems with the same set of problems from X2. On my 64-bit Windows 7 system with an nVidia graphics card, the organizer was always slow and never worked properly. The RAW lab had numerous flaws, including a major inability to deal with extreme highlights on many images. PSPPX3 would crash after working on large files for an hour or so. Customer Service's standard answer to a problem seemed to be ""it's a conflict with something running on your computer,"" and then a directive to uninstall, reinstall and test other running programs running one by one until you locate the conflict with PSPPX3. Corel is the only company I have dealt with to offer that as a standard solution to a problem with their software.

I am no longer willing to tolerate all the troubles with the software. I have removed PSPPX3 from my computer and moved on. I now use the extremely powerful PhotoLine 16 for photo editing and ACDSee Pro 3 to organize my images and develop RAW files."
Excellent program. No problems filing my return.
"As others have said, this is the WORST backup software I have ever used. Here's my story, which sounds much like what others have experienced.

After a Vista crash the Memeo GUI appears telling me I have no backup plan (a plan was there before the crash). Upon the start of a recreation of a plan, the old plan was found on the external hard drive ... that's great, right? NO! The index had to be rebuilt, which essentially means everything is being backed up again.  When I rebooted, the plan was gone completely.  Memeo technical support has been no help so far, the only thing I can find in previous support requests was to start over.

Other drawbacks are the backup runs constantly, backing up on the fly.  This is annoying because some files, which are not in use, are being backed up constantly.  Also the balloon tips, which can't be shut off via the software appear incessantly - it was so bad I had to edit the registry to turn of balloon tips altogether."
"I have used nearly every version of Acronis backup software, and all have worked well when needed. I realize I am a bit over the top on this, but I use two, portable, high-capacity drives, one of which gets a complete computer disc and partitions backup from my work computer each alternating night. I have actually needed this at least four times over the past six years.
This new version I have used to do a backup, but have not yet had to do a restore. I had a glitch with the first release of ver. 2015 not being able to do a backup, but the second release (update) seems to have fixed that. Overall, I am satisfied with Acronis products,"
"After 3-frustrating hours I finally installed the 2014 Enhanced Payroll. My 2013 subscription was set to expire on the 24th, so I started the renewal process 4-days early - just in case. By then, my 2013 subscription had mysteriously already expired.
Try to call Intuit on any of their published support phone lines and you will be directed to their patronizing website payroll.com/helpme. You're out of luck if you do not have an internet connection. After navigating layer-after-layer, I was unable to find a solution to my simple request to renew an expired subscription, so I had to choose a logical department.

The Intuit rep that answered my call did not understand my request or English. He asked me to download an app to allow him to control my computer and then told me I had to upgrade when he could not validate my account that I have had for more than 10-years. I was forced to hang up or lose my sanity and try the only other function, the ""Call Me Back"" service. That failed after 12 minutes on hold - and this is after they called me! Intuit called again later and this rep understood my request but obviously had no experience with customer service etiquette in the US.

This is how to install your update for an expired subscription: If you purchased this boxed subscription, the cd will instruct you to use the ""Update from Box"" option. This option does not appear on the QB Premier 2013 - that is until you delete your expired key (EMPLOYEES -> MY PAYROLL SERVICE -> MANAGE SERVICE KEYS). Only then will the wizard advance to the registration page where you are greeted with this friendly mandatory notice:

I understand that I am enrolling in an auto renewal program, and by entering my account information and clicking Continue, I authorize Intuit, via electronic signature, to charge my credit card account the year's subscription price then in effect each year until I cancel.

Hey Intuit, newsflash I DO NOT AGREE! That is why I always purchase my discounted subscriptions from Amazon. Unfortunately, QuickBooks is a necessary evil. They price the cost of their automatic updates to make them cost prohibitive and the process of implementing a third party purchase nearly impossible. I have a year to consider options and it will not be Intuit. Steer clear if you can.

At the time of this review, you can reach QB Payroll division at 1-866-223-5562 - Good Luck - you're going to need it!"
"Appears to work as well or better than previous versions of Office with the added advantage that it is always updated.  I was a little confused about customizing it but my changes are still there even though the program is online.  Best deal is to buy from Amazon, at least for the first year.  I'm unsure about the renewal options."
"Two star rating is a fair assessment. Beware those thinking about purchasing, the Using Bibble guide that is included with the CD is very restricted in providing information on its main functions.

For example, the Understanding Section under Advanced Image Editing,has 10 "" understandings"" covered over 4 pages in approximately 1800 words. Just take one of these,Highlight Recovery, two paragraphs (120 words).

Ben Longs, Getting Started with Camera Raw, his ""Highlight Recovery"" 4 pages 6 coloured examples, and 2000 words.

Bibble is confusing, particularly in the layout and panel section, additionally it devotes considerable (excessive)space to batch and queue processing.

I've assessed the software, and I believe, prospective purchasers should download the 30 day trial. I cannot recommend $90 version.

Adobes'Photoshop Elements 6 wins by a mile...

To those ""professionals"" out there, you're right, I haven't given a full assessment to the software, that would require another text book of ""what's wrong"". Just beware when thinking about investing $90."
So far my son likes it. You are able to be very creative with this music maker
"TOP OF THE LINE, perfect!! I am so happy with this. I love to take pics and to show them off, but Im a dolt when it comes to photoshop. Ive always used cheap, imitation style programs. This one made me a pro in one evening! I cant wait to get some winter pics and see what I can do with them!!!"
i love doing taxes.  Thanks Turbotax!!
"It is a great program, I needed a program like this for my daughter's school projects. It has all the features you need for all kinds of presentations and work."
"I've been a Quicken user since they stopped supporting Microsoft Money.  While I hate to say, it's not MS Money, it is an okay piece of software for managing your personal finances.  I like it because it has great online support from pretty much any bank you want, it will download and automatically enter your transactions and keep your finances in a reasonable state of organization with minimal effort on your part.  Intuit, I docked you one star because your software is buggy.  Odd things like the dialog boxes scroll the wrong way, and it there needs to be more integration in your software, not a million little pieces strung together.  Plus you make me wait to look at my finances while you download them.  What's the point of an operating system that offers true multitasking (something we've been capable of since the 90's) if you don't use it?

However, I was a little skeptical of the online download, until after I'd done it.  It's easy to do, and the best part is that Amazon keeps your download available online anytime you need it.  If you're a power user like me and you regularly upgrade your laptop or reinstall your operating system on a regular basis you will find this downloadable copy to be a great alternative to the pile of CD's and DVD's that you would normally use to restore your system.  No discs to keep track of, no scratches, and it's ready on demand.  You don't even have to get up off the couch."
I don't care what others say. I'm a fan of windows 10.
"Please don't buy this software, it gives you a false sense of security then when you finally need it, it doesn't work. I had numerous backups on external hard drives and finally tried to restore and all my files were corrupt. You can't get support unless you update every time these shysters send you an email. I had a version six months old and didn't qualify for support. Avoid this company at all costs. They're Reseller Ratings score is 1.67, that should tell you all you need to know. Their forums are the only way to get help and they rarely are up and running."
"This is the same version that you receive with office 365, don't buy both they won't return."
"Old computer died on me, bought a new laptop, got the fatal worm/virus after free protection expired.
Bought this product, installed in both, problems solved!
It will protect three units.
Great buy, fast shipping!"
There is nothing better if you have a business.  Answer questions that are asked in simple english.  The questions will also clue you in to possible spending that is deductable.  Four fifteen minute sessions should get it done if you have been organized.  Then sit and watch as it takes that data and digests it and spits it out into all of the endless documents required by federal and state.
"Is there sucha thing as NO STARS? I was told I could program my Ipod on my Windows ME Gateway computer using this disc...packaging on disc box and case says same...It has turned out to be a bust...no can do...money down the drain.  Anyone want to buy it and try it?  ...It was a waste of money to me.  No instructions, no phone support to get help WHILE trying to utelize it ..BUST.  MY Ipod still isn't programmed..,.another waste of money as it turns out..to date..purchased week before Christmas..."
"This program refused to install on my window 7 units; 32 or 64 verison. This is after I exchanged the program twice - same result; Called the tech support and it still doesn't work.

However, It does works on my old xp machine; I haven't test it on my mac yet - but I think it should work okay.

But seeing how their software had been plague by tech issues - (last year, I also exchanged the disk twice due to disks failure, one had no program on it.) I am guessing I will start using other tax program next year - too bad too because they were great programs."
"As a teacher, I know this wouldn't maintain the interest of a child who has been exposed to overstimulating/excessive media. If your child has had little contact with media and has little computer experience, then this would be a good introduction to computers (which at the age of 4, really should be the case. People, stop using tv as a babysitter. Studies show that only when parents spend time with their children watching the media and conversing with them about what they've watched, that even ""educational"" media has any benefits. And it was the same level of stimulation as children who had no media time and conversed with their parents instead. Children who watch media before the age of 2 without parental engagement are UNDERPERFORMING and UNDERDEVELOPED, especially in motor skills. By the time they come to school, we are frequently dealing with children who can't hold a pencil or a crayon because they have been using an ipad to ""paint"" instead of a real paintbrush. They rarely catch up in their motor-neuron/hand-eye coordination. Check the American Pediatrics Association for more information and suggestions on media usage)."
"Just as some of the buyers have complained here in Amazon.com, the ""convenient"" installation in this Britannica DVD doesn't work.  Obviously, this is due to a bug in the program. So I have to keep the DVD always in the computer, an inconvenient option.  The multimedia is not as bad as some Encarta enthusiasts claimed.  This DVD has great content and is good for adults and researchers.  When I click ""Islam,"" I get pages after pages of articles.  You don't get that much from Encarta.
Verdict: Good for people 18 and above.  Kids may not find it interesting."
"I used to abhor tracking my income and expenses as sitting down to an antiquated program was so boring. But then came QB Online and my life around bookkeeping changed. QB Online Plus is FUN to use, easy to share with my accountant and brilliant at whipping up detailed reports on my business. And did I mention that I actually get paid quicker now with QB invoicing?  My clients can pay directly from their emailed invoices. QB Online Plus is a win win win."
It does everything it is supposed to for a great price
"Having had previous problems with compromised security on my home computer - I didn't have any high expectations about what this was going to be able to do. I can't begin to tell you how happy I've been with the software, though. There have been absolutely zero pop-ups, slow-downs, malware issues... NOTHING. It's really, truly worth every penny! And I got it for such a good deal on Amazon - making it that much more valuable.  Thanks!"
No Problems.  Works Great!  Easy to Install.  I use it with Hitman Pro.  I hope this helps you in your search.
"It takes my dictation very quickly and accurately.  it took a while to install, but it was well worth the effort."
"I was kinda flipping the coin when i came across this, and I thought i'd just give it a shot until i return it cuz they give you 30 day money back gaurantee. Turned out this is a little giant that pretty much gives you everything you need. I never heard of Namo, but it looks like they've been around for quite a while. It's sometimes a little complicated to figure out here and there, but most of the features are really powerful and user friendly. It's not perfect and we still need something in the middle of FrontPage and those crappy software out there, but for now I'll totally settle with Namo. Good stuff."
"I can't remember the exact price I got it for, but it was around half of the price on Amazon during some sale. A great value anyways at about 10$ a game or so. I have yet to play through all of the chamber of secrets or the prisoner of alaz. but the first one is awesome and I'm sure the rest will be as well. Quidditch is probably the best of out this package with tons of matches to play and kept me addicted to it for hours when I was bored out of my mind. Well worth the price."
"I bought this game for my 5 yrs old daughter.
I thought it might be fun to print those items and build by herself.

But after I install the game. It's very boring.
There are very few features/pictures for each activity.
About 2 or 3.
The color will go outside the picture lines easily and make my daughter feel sad.
(Even me can't make the color only inside the lines)

The background theme pictures are ugly, kids don't like them.
Only the color for crayons is good, colorful.

Although the price is very cheap now.
I still think it's wasting money.
Kid's don't like it!"
"this product is for American use only will not work for your Canadian based company! amazon does not tell you this!
had to return it with no guarantee of full refund! i did get full refund in the end!
the Canadian version is great now that i found it!"
Very thankful that I have quickbooks. Very user friendly and the tech support is amazing.
I have used Kaspersky for four years and it does everything it says it will do. This year I bought the 3 user for my daughter and son-in-law. My son-in-law the computer geek will not purchase anything else. BTW Amazon has the best price I could find.
"I was using Money 2005. The online update stopped working after two years and I was forced to upgrade to Money Plus (for a price of course). It does NOT offer any more useful features than Money 2005 and it's buggy. The online update never finishes. And it always say ""Update in Progress"". I work for a software company myself. I would have fired everybody in the Microsoft Money team for making the software worse."
"I purchased this for my children for Christmas. They were very excited!  Well when I programed it to the computer, it didn't work. It said I HAD to have the color setting at 256. If we have the color setting this low, it effects the rest of the screen, and makes it look fuzzy. But I did try and do it, and all the other things they suggested, and it still didn't work. So  I emailed the company for help, and told them I had tried all that they had suggested and it didn't matter.  When I got the reply, they told me to try the same EXACT thing that I had tried and referred me to their help section.  BEEN THERE!  DONE THAT! I was very disappointed that they didn't seem to read the message I had sent them the first time. So we got the program and can do NOTHING WITH IT!  The 256 color is an old setting. I can't believe we have to have it set there, but no matter it still doesn't work, and not much help from the company!!  I would think twice to buy anything from them again."
"MapPoint's biggest selling point is how easy it can be integrated with Excel or Access to crossreference demographic and business statistics.  If nothing else, you can easily use it as an encyclopedia of US demographic traits by state, county, ZIP code or census tract, conveniently downloadable into an Excel spreadsheet.  If your work entails collecting and analyzing raw data with Excel, MapPoint can be a very powerful tool.  However, MapPoint's use is limited in creating visually appealing, customizable maps (ostensibly its primary purpose).
The inability to fully customize a map's presentation, and particularly the colors, is a real drawback.  The program features a limited number of color schemes for presenting data.  There is no way to remove county names and other labels even from the less-cluttered ""Data Map"" option so as to create a ""data-only"" map.  Perhaps a more difficult problem for the advanced user is the inability to create completely accurate maps at levels other than those included in the standard package (such as cities and towns) or to define your own territories and boundaries."
"This product does not come auto-bundled with Microsoft office anymore. I was expected to purchase it separately. Well actually, if I wanted access to my documents I had painstakingly worked on ever again, I did not have choice. I had to shell out extra bucks for this ontop of the new computer. All of that aside, the setup process was fairly easy---because I was left to do this completely on my own too  Print preview and zoom (for some reason) are now difficult to find??"
"I share the view of the prior poster.  I bought this program and assumed it would integrate with a database.  It does not at all.  You need to buy the professional version.  Seems like a scam that it does not connect to a datasource.  I ended up paying another 237 bucks to get the professional version, after paying 125 for the base product."
I purchased the total security 2year and I am so happy I did. This program loads easily and is user friendly. I did alot of research on the best programs and decided to go with Bit Defender. I will never go back to norton or mcafee.
"I was a die-hard ""ink-on-paper"" fan for a long time. But Kindle won me over a couple of years ago. This latest version works very well on my Mac and makes reading about as easy as it can get. I especially appreciate being able to switch back and forth between platforms without losing my place. Reading just doesn't get any easier."
I have been using Norton exclusively for 5 years now. I have not had a single virus or instance of malware since I started using it. It is simple to install. Each year I just buy another 3 license pack and run the install. Works perfectly every time.
Awesome and fun product.
The program works extremely well. It will capture netflix and put it into a file that can be used later to watch your favorite program on a iPad or android tablet or phone. I tried several other programs with poor results or too much work to get a movie to watch. It has options to  convert  the file you capture to just about any format you might want. I'm very pleased and it has paid for itself in lost time . This program sets the bar that other programs should try to attain but don't
Probably never going to use it again. had to get it for a class... But it works great
"I got this for Green Screening and works very well. Since it is not the ""professional edition"" it does not have everything. Simple editing tools, cool transitions, effects, HD movie support, exports to a lot of formats. I have a intel core 2 duo and a laptop so the exporting times are a little slow but if you have a more updated proscer then it's not that slow. I was happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone who need a inexpensive yet good video editor."
"It does exactly what it says, and does it well.  I know there are religious schools of thought regarding Parallels vs. VMWare and in any given release one of them will offer a new feature the other won't until the next release, etc.  However, I find that Parallels is a consistent performer, does really well with quad-core Macs and has some pretty clever UI integration features for the native Mac user.

Like most folks I bought this initially to run Windows, but have also enjoyed creating a Linux and a second Mac system with it to try out configurations or to test multiple builds of software.  Very neat."
"Need to brush up on your typing skills??? Want to have a bit of fun doing it? This is the program to get then. As an adult, wanting to work on speed and accuracy, I have found this program very helpful. It's also fun as well. Plenty of extra practice activities on your weak areas. An all round excellent program, that will deliver what it promises, as long as YOU stick with it, and devote at least an hour a day to the drills, games, etc. You will improve your typing skills greatly, but you do have to devote the time needed to do so. It won't work as well, if you only use it once a week. If you are like me, you will get so caught up in the activities, and wanting to top your score, that before you know it 2 hours or more have passed. It's really that much fun."
Awesome price for this great product!
Provided everything I needed and made it easy
"VERY old software version (can't believe they still sell it!) which won't work with Window's Vista.  If we can dredge up an old computer running 95 (are there any left alive?), maybe we'll get it running.  I should have read the info better!!!"
"I have used several photo editing softwares over the last 25 years, including Core Paintshop, and this is the first one I can't do anything with.  As soon as it opens it stalls and does nothing until I stop it.  Has anyone else had this problem?"
Programing out of date I did not read it well my bad the games are slow no fun don't buy
"I purchased this product about a week ago and had to return it. First of all the company wants to charge me... to talk to tech support regarding several error messages that I was getting.... P>I disabled ""Norton Anti Virus"" and ""GoBack"" and still get an error message. I finally e-mailed their tech support, and they indicated to me that I need to contact Compaq to help me disable some softwares in the BIOS.
Well folks, this is supposedly an easy software to deal with. Guess what...it is not.
You can't back up to an external FireWire or USB drive and if you want to back up a 20 gig drive you'll need about 35 CD-R/W disks. What if my whole hard drive freezes or crashes, what good does it do me to do an image on that same drive.
..."
"It's hard to use, don't have a decent manual, the forms aspect its like a 10 years old child homework, you have to work a lot and spend a lot of time to obtain something not decent, no proffesional, and the brochure that comes inside of the box (that's not a manual, its a joke)says: TECHNICAL SUPPORT $24.95 FOR THE FIRST 10 MINUTES AND $2.95 FOR EACH ADDITIONAL MINUTE. Thats a robbery to me. Save your money, buy something else, but not this"
"My son loved it. We just got it today and he played the game for a little bit and enjoyed it a lot.

Yes I would recommend this."
I wasn't aware that this version was geo locked. But Microsoft Support did an excellent job in getting me the link to download an unlocked version after confirming that the key was legit. Install was a breeze and happy with how it works.
"Very dissapointing software, cumbersome to use.

1. Endless login screens: every time I attmept to print checks - either in native window or from Quicken, I have to go thru a series of login screens, even if this is within the same Quicken session. In the software native window, the ""back"" button logs you out (unexpectedly) and you have to login again.

2. The apperance of printed checks is different from what you seen in check designer - text is  misaligned, extends beyond printable boundary etc.

3. Using paper with 3 checks per page, be prepared to waste the whole page even if you print just one check: the software prefills another check on a page with your personal info, byut without the rest of check  graphics, making it unusable for either future printing of manual writing

4. worst of all - every time you quit the software (e.g., finish printing), the computer is frozen for half a minute

There is only one good think I can say about it- 30 day money back guarantee. I bought the software yesterday and today I am going make use of this policy!"
A wonderful product that does everything you need it to.
It worked great and by mother of monkey milk was it hard. I don't know what 6th graders were learning then but playing it now it was crazy. I played on a Windows 7. It was a little glitchy through the graphics because of the system but thats not the cds fault. But it still works. All of the Cluefinders should work on the Windows 7 Opp.
"I've used several photo and video editing programs, and these are my favorites. Easier to learn than PhotoShop, but more robust than most of the simpler photo programs-- and the video editing has a huge range of features and is stable. Here's a little more on each:

PHOTO

I've had versions 2 and 3, so this was an upgrade from 3 for me. If you're upgrading, you'll notice that the interface looks different. I wondered whether the upgrade was going to be worth it-- drives me crazy when software companies come out with new versions every year and you have to pay for upgrades. But Corel doesn't disappoint.

There are now three workspaces: ""manage"" to upload and organize your photos, ""adjust"" for quick editing, and ""edit"" for more in-depth editing. On-screen tutorials teach you what's what.

I was particularly impressed with the improvement to the advanced red eye feature-- you ever get a photo where the flash doesn't just turn someone's eye red, but like a giant blue circle (like you see in pet photos)? I had a great picture of my daughter and her cousin, but one of my daughter's eyes was all bizarre like that and I had little hope of making it look normal. Then I used the advanced red eye feature here, and it actually ""rebuilds"" the eye. It draws in a pupil and everything, asking you what color to make the eye. And the darn thing looked natural!

If you had preferences saved in an older version, you'll have to redo them here-- for example, whether or not you want to save all original photos when you're editing them.

There are some cool new effects, like kaleidoscope and sandstone.

Other new features: You can now upload to Facebook and Flicker and send photos by email directly from the program. At least theoretically-- I haven't yet had any success getting my e-mail configured with the program, but that's not a big deal for me.

You can also print multiple photos on a single page more easily now.

VIDEO

Many reviewers have mentioned this software as being ""intuitive"" and that they didn't have to crack the manual. I can only assume that those reviewers weren't trying to do very complicated things with the software-- which is totally fine. There's a great market for people who want nothing more than to create little personal videos for family or online use. However, for those of us who want to ""take it to the next level"" without months or years of studying, you can definitely do that with this software.

Until now, most of my home movies were made using One True Media-- a super online service for beginners that makes it very easy to make short videos combining photos and digital video clips with music and effects to share online or burn to DVD. However, I had pushed that service to its max-- it gets very, VERY slow and tedious when you try to make long videos (mine were mostly around 30-45-minutes). The download times were appalling and there were certainly limitations to how much you could customize. So I was ready to try a more advanced program, and this one fit the bill.

I didn't find it quite as intuitive as others did. Some of the basic functions were simple to figure out, but if you want to explore the nitty-gritty bits that make this program what it is and set it apart from earlier versions, then you're probably going to need the manual and the online tutorials, and maybe some good ole' search engine help. For instance, I had problems figuring out how to get Mercalli to work to stabilize parts of my videos. When I tried to apply it to my clips, an error message would continually tell me to try again. Some poking around online finally led me to a video where a user showed the simple step I was missing that enabled Mercalli to work-- which was nowhere in Corel's manual. I loved Mercalli-- I was walking around during a parade while filming, and using this program, it looks so much smoother. Very little trial and error is necessary to figure out the right settings for particular types of clips.

I also wanted to figure out how to customize my audio tracks to fade in and out at particular intervals-- to be quiet during video clips and louder during still photos, for instance-- and couldn't figure that out entirely from the manual, either. It was a video from a VideoStudio Pro X2tutorial that walked me through the steps (even though the interface looked different, it was close enough that I could figure it out).

The newly-added Boris Graffiti is nice, too, to create titles and graphics that are more interesting than you'll find in simpler video programs. This will really allow you to get graphically creative if that's up your alley.

The program has crashed on me once in about 20 hours of heavy use (during audio uploading), but it saved my project, so it wasn't a big deal. However, I have a machine well above the specs required, so I was a bit disappointed that it crashed at all. It loads and uploads video, audio, and photos in a reasonable amount of time.

There are vast numbers of tutorials on YouTube that show how to really get the most out of the program using features like stop-motion animation, image correction, and advanced video editing techniques, so it really depends on how much time and effort you want to expend to get the best result. You can be satisfied with just studying the program for an hour or so and making a nice little video, or you can spend a month or two learning all the ins and outs and making really impressive videos that you can use to promote your business, preserve family memories, and so on.

I think it's a very fair price for all the bundle includes. You can't go wrong with these two programs if you're ready to play with some great photo and video editing tools."
It did Not Work On My Computer
"One star might be overkill, but Intuit explicitly asked for me to write a review right at the moment when I was feeling particularly frustrated with their product.
I've used Quicken for many years, and it's been some time since there's been any new feature I've cared about.  I try to use the existing version as long as possible until they threaten to kill my ability to download transactions from my banks.  I would have happily paid them to get support extended, but instead, they forced me to install the new product which has a worse interface and new bugs.  Why can't they show consistent $$$ amounts on accounts on all screens?  The discrepancy is minor, but disturbing.  Also, their new portfolio of investment assets is a major leap backwards - no longer possible for me to view positions and then enter a transaction on the same screen - they force me back to a previous screen, which wastes time and makes detailed reconciliation difficult.
Other interface changes are neutral, just irritating that I have to learn new places to find things.
It bewilders me why they have to keep all these programmers on staff just to make the product worse over time.
---
Update: The Bugs continue to mount.  Today I tried to reconcile transactions.  It warned me that the two transactions I was trying to reconcile had different amounts.  Not true, they were exactly identical.  It refused to let me say they were the same, so I eventually had to leave the reconciliation screen and delete one of them.
---
Update:
The bug list grows and grows.  Investment lot positions are calculated incorrectly due to commission costs under Account view.  It shows correctly when I look at the original transaction.  I wasted 25 minutes trying to figure out why it was not reconciling to my account statement.
---
Update:
Gotta hand it to them - it takes real effort to make so many bad decisions in the interface.  It used to be that you would ""accept"" a downloaded transaction from either of two buttons.  Now one says ""Accept"" and the other says ""Save"".  As far as I can tell, they do the same thing.  Why the different labels?  When I fixed a wrong password, it acknowledged it, then gave me a big button saying ""Proceed to next error"".  Confused, I clicked it, and got right back to the same screen, asking me to retype the same password I had just fixed.  WTF?"
"Mavis has shown me (and my employer) that you CAN teach an old dog new tricks!
I've gone from a ""hunt and peck"" typist, typing 5-6 wpm to over 25-30 wpm in about 3 weeks spending about an hour a day; AND doing it the right way. I did not take typing in high school but have played catch-up in my late adulthood thanks to Mavis #18."
Good product.. Helped to explained in terms my child could understand... I would recommend this to my friends. Good price.
"Quicken forced all users to upgrade for transaction updates as stated in other reviews.  My issue comes with the ""upgrade"".  Many of my accounts are no longer auto update.  The program crashed 3 times while attempting to enter my accounts for auto updates.  Some of my accounts aren't recognized anymore, and when trying to enter my savings accounts I get asked for a routing number, which is not readily available on my savings accounts and will require contacting the bank.  This is after two hours of reviewing info and attempting to straight out the mess.
good luck"
is this usb 3.0? why would i spend $40 to clone the free .iso of Kali or any version of linux onto a $1 usb stick?
"I was hoping I could import (and at the minimum export) GIS shapefile in this program, which is a map format used by many other mapping softwares. There is so much free data in the public domain in shapefile format, but you can not use it in this program. Nor can you export anything you create in this program to other mapping softwares like ESRI ArcMap or AutoCAD. The subject isn't even cover in help or on Microsofts web site.

I was excited to see a ""coupon"" feature where you can look for special offers geographically, but was very disappointed that you have to pay extra to use that feature. In addition, like other reviewers have noted, if you want to use the GPS feature, you have to purchase it separately.

Road mapping coverage is limited to the USA and Mexico. The rest of the world is shown, but only by country boundaries and name.

What is good about the product?
I like the ""Data Mapping Wizard"" that lets you visual all sort of demographic data (age, education, ethnicity, income, occupation) along with much more like earth quakes and weather.

I also liked the cartography of the maps. They are very visually appealing and easy to read. There are lots of ""push pin"" symbols to choose from and the printed maps look very professional as well.

Overall, I think the package is somewhat overpriced at $300, but considering at full-feature GIS software from ESRI costs $1,500 to over $10,000; it's a good way to get started. Another good option is to consider Google Earth Pro. For $400 you can import shapefiles and use GPS data too."
This was an awesome buy for the amount of PCs it covers. I only needed it for two but it's cheaper than buying each separately.
"this wasn't challenging enough for my first grader, even the 2nd grade items. she got bored quickly, the games were fun however she wanted more."
This is a really great product and perfect for my home finance.  It's really easy to work with.
"Was unable to download to my computer, so me was a waste of money. My computer stated no compatibility and I checked and the box stated I am able to use, but after several tries I just gave up."
POS!!!! beware! You'll spend countless hours trying to unsuccessfully installing this product. No tech support from Nuisance to speak of.
"It was two years ago, that I bought a HP HDX9010NR 20.1 inch portable computer at CompUSA. They recommeded the AVG software, so I bought my first security software. It was v7.5 and with the CD included, I was able to install it in short order. My old CPQ computer, would at times, require a full backup, as I got various virus(s) and this would take about (8) hours to download everything again. I soon learned, a faster way (<20 minutes), to recover on the CPQ. After the CompUSA recommendation, I loaded the AVG 7.5 on my new computer. I use a dialup=[...], at around $8.00/month, as most of my work does not need to be fast, and so I can save a little money, since my retirement eight years ago. But... my data that I download off the internet, does need to be done everyday for sure, except on the weekends. I always buy at least two identical computers, sometimes even, five of the same model. In fact, we have five old HP's from the early to mid 1980's, that we still run every Friday nite, with our own programs for (4-6) hours. The secret to long lasting computers, is to have UPS's installed, and to always inplug them, when not using them in case of an electrical surge brownouts, or even lighting. We use a Christmas tree remote controls, to assure, the main electrcal lines are indeed off, plus all the UPS's switches, and even the computer switches are off too, when they are not in operation. So 1980 to 2009=29 years and still the original five computers, are in perfect running shape, as in ""brand new"". These old computers are not on the internet, however, and are not ""windows"" and so have no security problems or attacks.

Recently AVG wanted me to upgrade, for free, to v8.5 as my two years, on 7.5 had not yet expired. I tried twice, and with dialup and Vista Ultimate, I failed every time, at around the two hour download mark. As my contract, was soon over, I decided to buy the AVG v8.5 on a CD, so I could download quickly. The best price, I could find was {{AMAZON.COM}}, and so my 3 computers version and 8.5 was quickly shipped by Amazon. AVG about that time notified me, that my two year contract, was about to expired, yet Amazon thru USPS deliverd the v8.5 just in time (JIT). Later AVG gave me an extra month, to buy from them, before cutting me off, but I was up and running by then. Having the CD makes the download much faster, and I more than likely, could not download the new AVG, due to my dialup's slow speed with Vista/Netscape.

Many times the old 7.5 would yield a popup window saying, my E-Mail virus protection and my firewall were not installed. Now, with the v8.5, I am fully protected in all items listed, in the AVG main window. One word of caution, is in the update and searching through your computer files, can take up to two hours when scanning your whole computer. I had it set, to do that at 22:00 each night, and that is way too much and too often. I have since cut that back, to only once per month. I try to go to lunch, at a restaurant, and come back in say two hours, and she will be done scanning. Your computer can get extremely slow, if that task is done in the background, while you are surfing the net.

All and all, AVG appears to me to be an excellent product, and I would give it a full five stars for their technology and constant updates of their latest protection improvements. After reading, all the other folks discussions, about other security products/systems coupled with others own AVG ratings, I am sure that I have the best system available. My two new HP 9010's computers have, dual hard disks, and also have a unique recovery {Restore points}. I have used several these times. but that is part of the Vista Ultimate system/HP system, which is fine too. I also bought from Amazon.com the books on Vista, Office 2007 and Excel to serve as backup references for us.

One unique problem, that I did have, is that on rare occasions the computer would lockup completely. In fact, the first weekend she locked with the familar spinning circle forever. I did everything, to unlock the computer, and even drove across town to Books a Million to find the answer in a reference book to unlock. No book had the answer. I finally used my brain power, and even pulling the power cord she kept spinning. I said you {idiot}, you must kill that darn computer, yet the battery is still powering it on. I disconnected all the extras; like printer, dual coolers, modem, and my three floppy Sony drives, and turned the computer upside down, on my couch. I released the battery, and it fell out, and it quit spinning circles. I had killed my computer!! Later, I found that if I had pressed, the on-off button for five seconds long, the darn computer would have re-started itself. When I graduated in 1960, from one of the finest engineering colleges (Ch. E.) in the USA, we did not have a computer, and now I have (15) computers myself. I even own Viscalc Software 1980 version, that was the pre-Excel software, that Bill Gates bought to build his Excel product line and empire of MSFT.  In the end, software, is more valuable, and worth the money, if it does the job; if it doesn't it is worth absolutely nothing. Believe me, AVG appears to be worth the price, at Amazon.com.

I have never been disappointed with the items I have bought at Amazon.com nor at Northern [...]. Almost all my computers and printers are HP's. Why not the best? You will not be disappointed.

I hope this rather lengthly discussion has been an aid to you.

I was sent Kaspersky 2014 even if I ordered Kaspersky 2015. Giving two stars not one is because its low price and I could download the latest version with same license key. However downloadable version is cheaper than disc version anyway.

"Over the past year, we have purchased every Nancy Drew for our 12 yr. old daughter.  It is a wonderful series of games for anyone to play.  It takes a lot of thinking.  I don't feel like these are a waste of time to play.  I have never had any problems with any of these games."
"I received it last night and took it for a test drive. Right away it expects you to start pronouncing Korean Words.

How can they possible expect someone to pronounce words correctly if one does not even know the sounds of the alphabets.
I think this software will be helpfully but you MUST have a solid foundation, and by foundation I mean know all the sounds of the Korean alphabets; vowels and consonants."
"Am just about gibbering here. had to wait ages for my healthcare exchange form from the state, before I could begin my taxes. I've been doing my own for years using H&R Block tax software.

Started putting in my information. When I put in my healthcare premiums, I got a screen that stated that since I got my healthcare through a healthcare exchange, I WOULD HAVE TO CONSULT A TAX PROFESSIONAL TO COMPLETE MY TAXES, AS THEY DID NOT PROGRAM THIS INFO INTO THE PROGRAM.

Contacted H&R Block via Facebook, and was told I probably needed to participate in their 'Best of Both' program. Looked at this, and it appears it is going to cost me at least another $150 to get their 'review' of my healthcare info & resulting tax implications.

While I understand this is a challenging and new situation, I DO NOT LIKE SURPRISES relating to my taxes. I expect transparency. If H&R Block cannot deliver a complete tax program, I expect to learn this BEFORE, not AFTER I purchase the program. I'm very disappointed."
It works but I got message asking to upgrade to WinZip 18 for fee. I did not upgrade it then it disabled my WinZip 17.
"Stay away. This products appears to have never been tested before

it was shipped!

Claims of Win98 support? Requires patches from their web site.

Once patched, ""DVD1"" lauches DVD #2 and ""DVD2"" launches DVD #1.

How hard can that be to find before you ship the product?

This is a collection of many CDs combined onto 2 DVDs. However,

all the programs have different presentations, different

interfaces. They all look, feel and act differently, confusing my

younger elementary school child.

Launching the Math programs from the menu starts an installation

of the math programs in a hard-coded, set directory and then

requires your elementary school child to know that those programs

are run from the Start Programs window while the other programs

are launched from the DVD. Trying to run the math programs from

the DVD again just installs the already installed program...

again (but of course, doesn't actually start the math program).

This collection of many different programs appears to be the

result of someone buying a bunch of different programs from

different companies at some open market in a foreign land where

software is cheap. Each one by themselve may be a fine program.

Once you put them together onto a DVD for grades 1-5, it becomes

confusing.

My Elementary School Child doesn't like to use this, and I can't

blame her."
"Apparently Adobe has lowered the price for the first year subscription to $20. per month for CS6 owners (from $30 per month).  However, we still don't know what happens next year and the year after that.  Analogizing to the real estate rental market, landlords typically have a teaser rate to get you signed up and then a year later they raise to ""market"" rents.  I fear the same thing may happen with Adobe.  It seems Adobe needs to offer some type of long term commitment as to the monthly price before my own concerns will be satisfied.

Also, I would like to see more packages offered, just like for CS6.  For example, I have Production Premium CS6.  If Adobe could offer that type of package in its new Creative Cloud offerings at a lower price than the price for this everything Master Collection, that would be helpful too."
"I bought account edge 2010 because it advertised that it could do my own payroll without enrolling for their payroll tax service. Ok, turns out after like 90 days the payroll expired, but I could still manually update tax tables so it would still do payroll. But then for 2011 it wouldn't let me update payroll tax rates in the tax tables, so I would have had to buy their upgrade AND payroll service!

Not to mentioned very poorly designed user interface, it's not intuitive and everything is really hard to find. Horrible support. Oh, and now that I'm trying to do my 2011 taxes my accountant needs a certain report ran, but oh sorry since I closed out the 2011 fiscal year I'm out of luck can't run that report. I don't even want to know what that is going to cost me with my accountant!

Not to mention that virtually no accountant uses this software!

Do NOT NOT NOT buy this software! It will be a big mistake!"
"Finely a good Operation System from Microsoft, less errors, faster, safely disables services that you don't need from running in the background, easy to navigate, etc.

"I typically don't update anything computer-related until I absolutely MUST because the learning curve always tends to cut into productivity for a period of time after. A recent computer upgrade forced the change from an earlier version of Office to the 2008 version. I was grateful they hadn't piled on too many changes. It has been pretty easy to jump in with a minimal loss of productivity. My only complaints are with the increased level of automation (correction of formatting, etc.) but that can all be turned off. For my purposes, there's a little too much extra in the Office suite and I would have liked a more bare-bones version, or an alacart option (yes I know about Neo Office and it sucks), but I understand why it's offered the way it is. I have liked (or at least gotten used to) the three or four versions of Word used over the past 20 years, or so, and I'm grateful for MS largely keeping the upgrades easy to master so I can focus on getting my work done."

"For a startup tech company, QuickBooks Online has worked perfectly for me with practically no orientation time.  Everything was about where I would expect it to be and the user interface was pleasing to look at.  The last time I used QuickBooks was with a CD install software package 7 years ago, and they have made huge leaps in usability."
"If you're new to Quickbooks you'll need a lot of support to get started. Most expensive software programs offer at least 30 days of free tech support and some offer 90 days. This company offers no free tech support. If you want to buy tech support, they will sell you an annual package of about $140. For me, that's overkill. I just have a few basic questions that aren't answered in the user manual.

When I was on the phone with tech support finding out the above info, I told him I would pass on his offer and just ask the online community. He said there is no online community for the Mac, only for the PC. Talk about treating us like second-class citizens!

Intuit is certainly not a customer-friendly company."
too clunky---iTunes much easier to use
"I have used this software for 10 months now, & I've found it very useful, but oh, so frustratingly s-l-o-w.  It is easy to use, once it finally comes up (took 20 minutes last night), so that even my 6 yr. old DGGD makes her cards all by herself.  We've sent a lot of cards to overseas troops, so even though there are some patriotic cards, I'd sure like Hallmark to have more selection suitable for deployed troops.

I don't normally buy cards because they are so expensive, but it is nice to be able to send personalized cards, so I do use it more than I expected.  Although there are a lot of designs, because there are so many categories & unusable ones, that I would really like to be able to download new designs.  One thing that has been particularly useful are the labels & tags.  I make all the tags for The Shoebox Project <[...]> & that is helpful.  For the past decade or more, I've printed all my Christmas & birthday tags (I could only handwrite ""TO:  Jeremy From:  Grandma & Grandpa"" so many times), but with this program I can easily use clip art & color for tags that are a lot more fun.  I use different holiday clip art for each gift recipient so I can easily find the correct tag in the drawer where I keep them (e.g., elder DD gets a cute Santa face, while I-for-Idiot SIL gets a sprig of holly because I couldn't find a holiday dunce cap).

I really dislike that I have to fire up a PC laptop to use this program.  I find myself balancing the laptop on top of my trusty Mac keyboard so I can use the same cord for the printer.  I also dislike that within categories, there is a sameness to the clip art.  Many designs are clearly done by the same artist & are too much alike.

I've tried several times to contact Hallmark to see whether I have to buy an entire new program for 2009 instead of an upgrade.  Could never reach a human.  Note that in late 2007 Sam's Club sold the 2008 deluxe program for a good discount, but I haven't found a lower than retail price yet for 2009."

"(Note: I am using SG on a Mac.)
Sitegrinder is indeed a revolutionary concept, and it seems so appealing for those of us who don't know CSS... HOWEVER, it is IN NO WAY as simple and carefree as they make it out to be. I have to struggle to get the sites to work, and even when they finally do, updating sites with client requests is becoming an absolute nightmare. For some mysterious reason, I find nothing but glowing reviews online. The endless deluge of problems listed in the SG Forums indicates that I'm not the only one having these issues.

GOOD:
- Very simple to learn, easy steps
- Very good support and documentation. Helpful Forum.

BAD:
- Random errors happen almost every time you use it
- Using in conjunction with Dreamweaver produces unexpected results, plus you have to re-grind from SG each time you make a design change, therefore you must re-do any work you did in DW. (Unless you know CSS, which defeats the whole purpose of this plugin.)
- It takes a long time to ""grind"" each time you have to do it.
- SG claims that its output is made to fit all browsers. It isn't. You still have to manually test your site on different browsers and different platforms to fix the little problems that pop up. Even the SG official site doesn't display properly on some browsers! That's saying something!
- simple updates are a insanely horrifying nightmare to get right
- Many times is unbelievably frustrating!

If I had to do it over again, I'd probably save my $ and actually learn CSS. I would NOT recommend basing your web design business on SG. In fact, as I speak, my client's website is in shambles because SG messed up something in the CSS and I am re-uploading the whole site. I would only recommend it if you don't mind figuring things out, and would like to build some personal websites."
just as advertised
Saved me over $40+ after buying this product.  The Norton Internet Security I got on my computer kept reminding me to pay $99 otherwise my computer is unsafe.  I only paid less than $40 for this product and it's amazing!
"I upgraded from Norton Anti-Virus 2003 to Norton Internet Security (N.I.S) 2004 online in August 2004.

Using this software is tantamount to cutting off the head to cure the cold. The N.I.S works so well that every single programme is filtered to the extent the computer's processor is unable to actually run the software at all. My laptop is not slow neither (Dell Inspiron 1.7 Centrino). It was unable to handle DVDs running through PowerDVD without freezing during DVD playback.

Now to the most frustrating part; getting a refund. I used the email non-technical issue response page - promising to provide a response within 5-7 days (five times), in an attempt to get advice on whether all computers were slowed down - waited a week no response.

I phoned Symantec (London) on a number of occassions, was put on hold for 20-25 minutes, then gave up. I did eventually speak to a woman, whom I believe was from Ireland. I came to the conclusion she would have been of more use picking potatoes for Symantec.

2 months post purchasing the software I am still waiting for a response! My only advice is use the firewall and security update available free from Windows Update (Service Pack 2). Coupled with the basic anti-virus from Norton this is sufficient. If you are still not content try McAfee's own version which PC WORLD in the UK have recently put before Symantec's attempt of Internet Security."
"I bought and downloaded this from the microsoft website.  Things I hate is that it is spying on you through the use of telemetry, as it is also  unreliable if you are running ip camera software and recording video with it,  as windows 10 will up and decide it is time to reboot whenever it wants.  I am looking for other operating system options, linux is not a viable option as you still need to often deal with the command line."

"Purchased the Hallmark Card Studio ""005 Deluxe while visiting relations in California last year. Ordered in USA and so far have been sent 2 copies of this disc but does not work - shows up print preview and there is nothing on the preview and unable to print any cards - friends have also tried it and have been sent it twice and still have the discs unused - Unable to contact anyone and phone number given was hopeless kept hanging on and left message and didn't hear anything - can anyone help with an address - very frustrating as it cost a lot of money and my previous 3 editions all worked perfectly.

So far it has been a great product. As described.
"I wanted to share the licenses with my friends overseas, but these can be used only in US. This is unacceptable - although it is mentioned, I didn't pay attention when I bought it so now I'm stuck with this useless product. It should be an option to invalidate the license and get the money back."
"I have used this, and the previous version, well.  Although it comes loaded with recipes, I'm not so interested come with it, mostly because I am vegetarian and I like to choose recipes based on that and based on multiple peer reviews. However, I love building my own cookbook with recipes and photos, or being able to have a cookbook just for the recipes I want to try.  Easily searchable with variable search options.  Prints great, customizable recipe cards or pages.  Can print out nutrition, easy to reduce or enlarge the recipe depending on the size of your crowd.  Easy to edit. Allows you to put in your own hints, suggestions, or comments.
I'm ready for a new version, though.  This works on Windows 7, but not on 8."
"I have been a Turbo Tax user from the beginning. I am so glad I read this review. I was going to buy Turbo Tax but no more EVER! I have to put up with the product activation with Microsoft and dread my calls I have to make since I frequently upgrade my hardware. I don't have to stand for this with tax software. I don't need anything beyond the IRS to raise my contempt. Intuit has taken the fatal step. Nice knowing you Intuit. I quit Lotus 123 and went to Quatro for the same reason (for those old enough to remember what those products are). Now I think I will take some time and find a product that I can use that doesn't insult me right up front. BTW, I would rate this product a zero (0) stars, but Amazon.com doesn't go that low."

"I bought this game as part of a package that came with a Rescue Heroes game, a Tonka Truck game, and a Lego soccer game (thinking my son would especially love the Rescue Heroes game).  My 4 year old had never even heard of Jimmy Neutron.  He barely plays the other games, but he absolutely loves this game.  He can sit and play it for hours. I like that I can save the game at several different points so that when my son wants to go back and play a different level I just load up what I have already saved. Most of it is not too challenging for him - there are a few parts that he has needed some help. There are lots of new things to explore each time he plays the game.  I also like that on most of the levels Jimmy's dog Goddard shows you which way you need to go.  My one complaint is that once the program has played the instructions there is no way to go back and review what you are supposed to be doing on that level.  A few times my son did not understand the instructions and since I hadn't heard them it was hard for me to figure out what he was supposed to be doing."
"Let's be honest, it has a ton of great features that I love...Now that that is out of the way; it stinks!

I didn't get to try out those great features; It crashes continually.  I have spent around 10 hours trying to fix it.  Tech support sends me some ideas...but none that actually work.  They finally told me to go into the program folder and rename certain application files because they are causing a conflict.  Really? so your program is not compatible with parts of itself?  (Oh, and that also didn't work)

The program is poor and the tech support is worse.  If only I had given up on it before it was too late to return it.  Oh well, I guess I chock the price of it, as a life lesson learned."
Highly recommend turbo tax for the do it yourself type of person.  Purchase turbo tax each year and will continue to.
"I bought this thinking it would solve all of my financial worries. Well, I have yet to figure out how it works. I've gone through it a bit but unless you've used this product in the past, there is a huge learning curve. I may have to find a class to teach me how to use it."
It does copy vhs to computer ok. However every time you do a new movie the preferences reset to default and you have to redo them. It freezes if you try to do anything else while software is running. It  does not close properly ever. Always gives an error message. Wasted several of our dual layer dvd+r's when it froze after writing a few percent to the dvd.
"Each time I attempt to download this onto my PC - I get Webroot Subscription page: expecting me to purchase.  I'm not new to similar processes, so this is very frustrating.  Thus far, I'm feeling ripped-off!"
"GREAT program, especially for the price! I always recommend it to anyone who will listen."
"Word 2003 includes development tools that add dynamic features to documents making them powerful than ever. The power beneath all this is XML, allowing the user to embed components for updating data in documents such as stock quotes. Word 2003 offers simple, familiar yet improved features regular users are accustomed to. Majority of the features in Word 2003 are aimed primarily toward businesses and the Enterprise. But are still necessary for the average user because of the control over information across all the Office applications. Tools such as Information Rights Management (IRM), (this controls the flow of information to specific users), persons can be restricted on how they use your Office files; whether it's printing or sharing, very powerful! Reading view is an enhanced mode of print preview; documents are laid out in virtual pages reducing the need to print. The Task Pane is also improved by offering resources to look up information on a particular topic being typed; this is a feature across the core Office applications. Lots of other great features make Word 2003 a worthy upgrade."
Easy to install. no complaints
The only thing that could make it better would be an independent equalizer for phone use. Otherwise I can get all the music I need.
and you won't have to constantly treat you PC like a bad girl friend.
"I love this Britanica DVD. The whole thing can install on your computer if you have the space.

I love the print Britanica encylopedias, because they contain more comprehensive articles than others.

Prior to using this DVD encyclopedia I used Encarta 2005, I think, and it was not nearly as comprehensive as this dictionary.

I love this software Encyclopedia, and in my opinion, everyone should own a encyclopedia set and this is a very affordable and space saving solution."
always a fan of kaspersky
Would not install.
"does nothing but look at me. no operating instructions, no trouble shooting instructions. Does not rise the the level of crap. I keep writing because reviews have a required minimum length"
"Really, TurboTax?  I have been using you for well over 15 years and now you are making me pay extra for Schedule D after I purchased and downloaded in my computer to a Premier version which I have never done in the past?!  Ridiculous.  For 2015, I am switching over to their competitor."
good
"I switched from XP because 7 was pre-installed on my new laptop. I had to re-learn many things (especially new Ms Office is frustrating t learn).

I installed Linux Ubuntu out of curiosity and must say that there is virtually no difference in ""learning new things"" for those who migrate from XP.

The CONs of Win7:
- slow boot and sluggish shut down
- heats up processor for no reason (my fan is always on with windows, rarely with Linux Ubuntu)
- uses up disk space (straight from the box takes 20GB compared with 4GB for Linux-Ubuntu)
- cost you loads of money
-for those who like tweaking things - not enough customization
- vulnerable to viruses

PROs
- better and more games
- runs highly specified software like SPSS, access (only reason for me to keep it)
- every bachelor in IT knows something about windows to help you in case you brake it and can not be bothered to google how to fix it yourself
- normally pre-installed - so you don't have to google how to get it in the first place.

as good as free Linux-Ubuntu (or any other Linux)
- when you need support - everything is in the forum
- if you use only internet, text editor, call skype, listen music, watch movies you will hardly need any support ever.
- regular updates
- lots of free software fitting any needs."
"I bought Internet Security 2008 online directly from Symantec to upgrade my 2005 version.  The download failed 3 times.  After finally getting a download, I watched it stick on the same screen for 45 minutes.  Since you can't call them on the phone, you have to use their ""Instant"" chat.  I was 4th in line, waited 30 minutes, and IE suddenly froze up and I lost my place in line.  Tried to re-install...nothing works.

Finally, I gave up and requested a refund.  Guess what--you go to online chat.  I am ""next in the queue"" but have been waiting for 45 minutes for a response.  They're probably waiting for me to go away.  Next I will  challenge the charge on my credit card, contact the BBB, and probably my state Attorney General.

Do yourself a favor--go buy something else.  If Amazon would allow a zero-star review, I'd give it."
Great software - writing my first screenplay and Final Draft makes it very easy to format!
"TurboTax has been good to me for over a decade, but it's increasingly frustrating to use with slightly more complex tax situations. This year, TurboTax couldn't deal with college savings plan distributions. Data I entered from form 1098-T did not carry over, and TurboTax insisted that I owed taxes for excess withdrawals. I spent over an hour with a friendly support tech, who agreed there was a problem, but could not resolve it. She bumped it to a supervisor who (immediately) said it was an error that would be fixed shortly. 6 wks later, error is not fixed.

I finally threw in the towel and went to an accountant. He saved me far more than he cost, and didn't waste hours of my time.

Too bad; I had been pretty satisfied with the product, but now realize this is not a cost-effective use of time for anything but simple tax situations."
"I was an iPhoto user before, but I'm very happy with the expanded capabilities in Aperature.  The only drawback I've seen is that I can't figure out how to convert/save a picture into black & white or sepia.  But I can always use iPhoto to do that.  I also love the custom books part - all the pages are customizable (you can change the layout, fonts, sizes, etc on each page), which you can't do in iPhoto's custom books.

Overall, I'm very happy with Aperature 2 and would recommend it to anyone that's serious about photography!"
"I am so pleased you have asked me re UP WORDS it is such a great game i have nearly worn out the CD.
I actually have bought a second one it is such a great game.
I am 82 i love it so do not hesittae to buy the game."
"System Mechanic 7 was supposed to be Vista compatible, it isn't?  It wouldn't even install on my machine.  I'm running Vista 64 incidently.  Anyway, I took it to another computer that was running windows XP.  It installed ok but then refused to run.  When I clicked on the icon nothing happened.  What happened to quality control???  Programme testing, anyone???  I don't think I will buy another Iolo product.  A waste of money and an absolute con!"
Good program - covers the landscape and is generally considered to be the standard setter in the category.  Easy to set up and use - and imported from my old software package seamlessly and easily.
Best out there
This is what I need for the protection
"I have just installed 64 bit Home Premium and also purchased a new computer with 64 bit home premium installed. The operating system loads faster, shuts off faster and so far has need a ""3 finger salute - control alt delete"" about as often as Vista. While the operating system seems to be very solid and has much better security, there are still a number of programs and web sites which don't seem to like 7. If I knew then what I now know, I would wait several months perhaps 6 until all the kinks are worked out. I believe ultimately you will like 7.

In the computer I upgraded, I did a clean install as I was switching from 32 bit to 64 bit. It was easily done but required a full installation of programs. I do note this computer is running much faster but part of that may well be that it now has 4 gb of memory as opposed to 3gb"
"Worked fine with Windows XP, but when I installed on Win 7 and Word 2003, RM internet pubmed searches became problematic. Sometimes RM will do them but sometimes they crash the program. Same thing happens in different Windows compatibility settings and with XP virtual machine. A workaround is to use import txt on RM file menu, PubMed.cap filter, then export citation from pubmed itself as citation.nbib file and save in my documents; RM can directly import this file."
... then you're not very smart.
Great suite of software that keeps me safe and doesn't use a whole lot of system resources.
"Works as advertised.  When buying this product, I recommend buying from someone with 100% ratings regardless of cost.  In the past, I've paid less for this product and found out it did not install or work as promised.  Many businesses still use Office 2007 so it's a worthwhile investment in my ability to remain marketable."
"I upgraded from 2012 to 2014 and found that there were very few improvements and I lost much of the functionality I had previously enjoyed. Most hot key short cuts (ctl-D; ctl-R, etc) only work occasionally. Customized reports I had created no longer work at all. Reconciling brokerage accounts saves nothing if it is interrupted and it does not realize we usually do this on a monthly basis. In short, it is even more quirky than it has been since I started using it about 10 years ago. The 'one step update' still takes about 3 steps.
In short, if you don't need to update because they stop supporting some function, avoid it. If someone knows a good competing product, please let me know. Competition is a good thing."
love it no problems and fast shipping
an excellent chess program for all ages. My 5 yo loves it. Shipping was fast and exactly as advertised.
"I read a lot of negative reviews about people having issues but my download was seamless and took about 15 minutes all in.

Works well as expected."
"Software did not run on my MacBook, totally dissatisfied.....I would like everyone to know do not purchase this software Mrmiata"
"1. The difference between OS X and OS 9 is greater than anticipated. I've been using Macs since 1987 and was a bit flummoxed at first. There's some non user friendly stuff you have to deal with. It's not like going from OS 7 to OS 8 or OS 8 to OS 9, where anyone reasonably Mac savvy can get acclimated quickly. OS X is way different, too different, and different in annoying nonMac ways. Yeah, think different, thank you Steve Jobs.
2. Font rendering. Jaguar has smoothed fonts THAT YOU CANNOT TURN OFF ABOVE 12 PT TYPE. It is absurd that the Mac, supposedly the computer for creative media artists yada yada does not give you the option to turn off font smoothing altogether. Anyone who loves to read clear sharp text will not like this."
It saved my life. I needed a probram to edit a file and this was the answer. It was nice that it could be downloaded immediately.
"talks briefly daily at start-up, Great product does it job keeping computer working as I expect."
Its Turbo tax. It works.  Nothing special to report....but I will say that they don't make it easy to opt out of their email barrage! ! !
As advertised
"I've been using TurboTax for over ten years and have tried both the web version and disc product. I prefer the disc product since new versions will read the information from prior editions and automatically import them after installation. The 2011 edition was the fastest install ever. Even the updates did not take that long. I had a state download for CA that was also quick and streamlined. I was able to have my W-2 information imported (a real time saver, love that option) and the step by step screens were easier than ever to walk through. Printing and saving was also quite fast along with the federal e-file. It took barely a day to be submitted and accepted (this was in late Feb). State e-file was offered for an additional $19.95 which I didn't bother with. Unfortunately I don't get refunds. TurboTax is a solid product. I think the disc version is better than the online since the installation will read the previous version information and saves you a lot of time, especially if you continue to use the product as long as I have. I would not consider another tax product. It is so easy to revisit options or jump around to different sections. After you do your taxes you may also be offered an opportunity to join the TurboTax panel and give input about your experiences and help improve the product. This is a worthwhile option if you would like your voice to be heard."
"What a POS ! I have 24 gigs of memory and can't even finish a small project without out of memory error messages, all the ease of the original print shop is gone ! don't waste your money, if only I'd looked at reviews first....."
"Only one star, because they aren't getting the basics.

I tried iBank via their 30 day trial earlier this year. Even with that it did not properly import the limited Quicken data I was able to import from my TWENTY-THREE (23) years of data from Quicken 2007 for Mac.
I thought perhaps iBank would address this VERY BASIC aspect in the latest upgrade since they are obviously trying to compete for previous Mac Quicken users ...... but no, not even in the latest and ""greatest""?

Another reviewer succinctly listed some of the other more basic features, common to Quicken, but STILL not present in iBank. I repeated those following ......

Things I hope they change:

1. The need to click OK whenever you want to edit a transaction.
2. Allow + and - or a pop-up box to change/enter dates
3. Have a blank transaction ready at all times rather than having to click + to add a new transaction
4. Allow tabbing through fields and allow enter to save transaction rather than clicking save. In general, anything to reduce the number of unnecessary clicks.

ONE OR THE OTHER ..... iBank, or Intuit

PLEASE ..... this is NOT Rocket Science!!!!
I am not sure WHY Intuit has essentially turned their back on Mac Users.
I have faithfully used Quicken from the FIRST day they introduced it. I have also used Turbo Tax from the first day you introduced it.
I KNOW THERE ARE MANY LIKE USERS OUT THERE THAT HAVE SUPPORTED YOU OVER THE YEARS AND HELPED YOU BECOME WHO YOU ARE TODAY.

BUT, PERHAPS iBank wants to take your place? Unfortunately, though they are sort of listening, they aren't listening.

SOMEONE, PLEASE LISTEN!!!!!"
"I have used previous versions of this product for several years.  It seems to be more current than some other similar products on the market.  I used to use it to set up 3 days worth of stops at various sites to improve my time and gas mileage.  Now I use it to find various addresses for either personal or business use.  It is so easy to use, and to save, addresses and locations around the city or state."
"Received product in mail in a week after ordering. Received the $30 rebate in about a couple of weeks.

Since I already had Live OneCare installed and running no reinstall was needed. Simply used the product key that came with the package to renew my subscription.

Very easy to use."
"My 4 year old sat down for the first time with this software at 3PM this past Saturday afternoon, and aside for a quick break for dinner (which was wolfed down because she wanted to get back to her ""'puter""), she played non-stop until past 8PM.

Learning her numbers, addition, phonics, grammar, following instructions (Tigger's Treasure Hunt is great!)...you name it. I can't think of a single problem with this software. There are even 3 levels of difficulty within most of the games.

Was not as impressed with the Mickey Mouse disk, but only one real quibble, really. On the spash screen where you can choose what game to play, the Pooh Bear disk says what each game is when you hover your mouse over it...so you know what it is even if you're pre-reading. The Mickey Mouse game does not. The rest was just fine...and fine-tuning her listening/observation skills with the bell-hop game (hotel guests call the front desk asking for a bell-hop with blue pants, bowtie and no hat, and you have to choose the right bell-hop from what looks like the Goof Troop) is a WELL thought out game.

Am DEFinitely recommending it to anyone with a 3-5 year old."
"The item arrived one time.
I have used MacAfee and its performance in protecting my PC is excellent
I recommend this to anyone who wants a functioning Pc without crashing

I thank the supplier for his commitment and efficiency"
"In past years the intuit TurboTax Deluxe version included Schedule D -- albeit with few instructions but at least it integrated with the rest of the tax forms.  The 2014 Deluxe version is missing Schedule D and other forms, requiring purchasing a $30 downloadable upgrade to Premier.  Switching to HR Block this year, who is offering free downloads to customers that made the mistake of buying TurboTax Deluxe 2014.  Also contacting intuit for a refund."
"This is a basic and average antivirus program. I didn't find anything special about it.. But it does what i want it to do, keep my computer virus free. I scan about once a week and i have no problems. I have never gotten a virus with this product. I will repurchase when my subscription expires. I also recommend it."
"Just Got this and I am new to editing, but it is well recognized in the editing community and has tons of feature. Expect a steep learning curve, but you can always use their one step or quick fixes until such time as you learn the software

Oh, and the Corel support... every bit as bad as you have heard, if not worse... don't buy this expecting any official support. corel doesn't seem to invest too heavily in it. But the User support community is fantastic and ier are numerous videos to help teach you!

Do get this software. It is very reasonable and the community support makes up for a lot that official support lacks."
"For those of you considering buying Money 2002, I'd suggest going to the Microsoft website and downloading the trial version first (which *is* the Deluxe version). It has a two month lifespan, which is perfectly adequate for figuring out whether you will like the product or not. I've spent the last two days mucking around with it and I really like what I see. I like the 'dashboard' functionality where you set up all your account details, portfolios etc, and then Money will tell you which stocks are doing well, doing badly etc. I am very wary of linking bank accounts directly into the internet, so in the meantime I'm just downloading stock information. It is a bit limited on the international stocks side, and the US product is (surprise surprise) catered for US tax law and US investments (eg: 401K). But I would expect that this would all come in handy for someone actually from the US. The best functionality in this product is definitely the dashboard, cash flow and budgeting facilities. Basically every time I log into Money, it updates itself with the latest Money updates (ie: patches etc) and stock values, and tells me at a glance how everything is going. I'd give it five stars, but there are minor gaps in the functionality - like you can't import historical share data if the share isn't on the MSN listings. But this is very minor. It is definitely designed for you to set up all your accounts, all your shares and bonds, set up all the links into the internet to get current prices/values/balances, and then periodically monitor and update as you require. I'm not planning on using all the functionality, but what I have seen is very neat indeed. Up until now, I have managed such information in Word or Excel. I will purchase this product before departing the US as I believe it will save me time in the long run."
Almost everything you ever wanted.
"(Updated 4-11-2007 and 4-29-2007 to reflect new information on my Parallels crash, as well as the new version that fixes some of the cons I originally posted.)

I just got Parallels today and this review offers you a first impression of what it is like to install and use.  First you launch Parallels.  The Parallels screen opens, and displays some key preferences that you'll probably want to edit (see tips below). Clicking the play button (like a movie) you launch Windows (XP in my case) which boots on my iMac in about 10 seconds. In the Parallels window, Windows looks just like you are ""booting"" it yet the Mac is running the whole time!  I switch between the Mac and Windows using ""command+tab"" (that's the ""open apple"" for you hardcore Mac'ers).  Here are some pros and cons as well as some tips.

Pro:
-Install of Parallels went smoothly... the set up was automated, and went quickly with little or no decision-making
-Scary how much my Mac acts like a Windows PC
-Windows install included immediate access to the internet through my Mac account, a huge surprise
-So far SUPERIOR to VirtualPC, which after hours and hours, I never got working... Parallels was so easy.
-All my peripherals seem to work, even my Sony mouse which has a memory stick slot in it (in other words, it's multi-functional/fancy and was supported nicely)
-I use my Mac to safely browse the internet and download programs... I even downloaded office for Windows on my Mac and then used Parallels to retrieve it (I could have used Parallels to get it directly, but then I'd have to browse using Windows and risk viruses)
-Share files very easily between the OSX (Mac) and Windows using a shared folder (I've shared photos and a free yet massive Microsoft Office trial program this way, to test it).
-Automatically maps PC Control key functions over to Mac Command key... handy!

Con:
-Technical support is worse than any other tech group I have had to use... my Parallels was down 3 weeks and they didn't even call or email me once to let me know what the status of my problem is (or that the problem was even received).  I finally called them and waited 90 minutes although the system said it would be only 10.  Each time I moved ahead in the queue, the quoted wait time got longer!  When I got through, they were able to resolve the ""black screen"" problem quickly (launching XP produced a completely empty black window), apparently it was common.  My other problem was the ""install tools"" wasn't working, which means you can't share a folder between the Mac and XP.  In the short term I emailed files to myself as a poor man's method to share files, fortunately I was working with small ones.  Turns out that while the cause is still undetermined, I found a Parallels disk image on my drive which when manually clicked, manually launched the installer I needed.  Weird.
-To me, the instructions are weak, the manual is not very good and instructions that come with upgrades are terrible... you've been warned
-Seems a little slow at times.  I've bumped up the ""RAM"" allocation to 604 MB (max recommended), but think it may need even more.
-People report slow or incompatible gaming.

Tips (Neutral Commentary):
-I recycled an old copy of XP that was registered once, but no longer in use.  When registering, call Microsoft as your option.  I left them know that I was ""reinstalling the software.""  I didn't bother to tell them that I was installing to a Mac... I figured that this would generate a pointless and a lengthy discussion to a confused person in India.
-After installing XP, immediately seek out the updates.  This might require many ""reboots"" which in this case aren't reboots at all.  The program cycles yet your Mac OS is running the whole time!
-If it's not already obvious, you need a copy of Windows.
-Give it RAM!  The default of 256 KB is laughable and will produce frustratingly slow performance.
-This will work alongside Apple's free ""Boot Camp"" beta so you can have the convenience of Parallels with the computing speed/compatibility offered by Boot Camp (with Boot Camp you must reboot your computer to switch between .  Windows and your Mac OS). Just remember that when you call Microsoft to register Windows, your copy of Windows is being ""reinstalled on the same computer.""
-Have your Windows Virus protection handy to install immediately
-Set aside time to install of Microsoft's updates to maximize security and compatibility. In the first 3 days I installed 124 XP updates (yes, I counted them, all 124 of them) from the Microsoft web site... you'll need to reboot XP many times to do this.
-My extended keys (i.e. the number pad area to the right) is activated using the ""clear"" key which is in the same position as the ""num lock"" would be... many functions behave like this automatically as described in the ""pro"" section above

Bottom line: Excellent, wonderfully handy! Amazing to see Windows XP coexisting with my Mac OS.  Pray that you do not need their tech support as I think that it is terribly slow and not very effective except for the more basic issues."
"The overall program is great, but the file import does not support older quicken files. I feel it should support all older quicken file formats. I had to download an older free version, then import that file into my new quicken. Dean"
After playing with this software for a short time I've found that it doesn't quite meet what I need so I'm probably going to go to an attorney to get my Will done. Someone a little more knowledgeable and willing to spend more time on this would probably find it very useful.
"Can't use it as it won't download, sending back."
"Being perceptually impaired, learning anything new for me is always a challenge. Being in the LOWER income bracket limits my choices of available products to learn from.

The price is a little steep but it works as advertised and without negative effects on registry as well....cool stuff.

"When you create an image on screen and then print it out it is distorted. i.e. an 8"" box will come out 7.5"" or even 8.5"".
Also fonts are not true to size.  You can specify 36 point type but when you print it and measure it with a pica pole the font won't be the size you specified.
Finding images in their files is not as easy as they say, even the most simplest designs. And you don't have all access unless you are online.
And it randomly shuts down.  Then it will say you can't SAVE to the drive.
If you want just something to piddle with go for it.  But if what you are designing is important look elsewhere."
As others have stated intuit has decided to gouge their loyal customers by changing the features of their product. I have used TurboTax Deluxe for several years successfully. This year I am informed that I have to spend another 50% to get the Premier even though nothing about my tax situation is any different from prior years. I would suggest that everyone drop Amazon an e-mail asking for a refund of their purchase and request TaxAct or H&R Block instead as it seems that there's no visible way to get a refund for TurboTax once it has been purchased. It looks like both of the other software products will do what TurboTax won't at the lower price.
"I have used the various incarnations of this product every year since the 1998 tax year, and have been very satisfied with its user interface, the previous year carry overs, the guiding questions, and the e-filing options.

Unlike online alternatives, I like to keep my tax information local on my own computer, as this product does."
"I am running Windows 7 Home Premium, 32 bit, on a Toshiba laptop.  I live in a rural area and subscribe to U.S. Cellular (USB modem)for Internet access.  After reading so many good reviews of Bitdefender Plus, I purchased and installed it.  Bitdefender immediately blocked my U.S. Cellular software so that I could not access the Internet.  Using the Bitdefender control panel, I disabled the various features of Bitdefender but still could not access the Internet.  When I would click on the U.S. Cellular CONNECT icon, nothing would happen.  In order to get back on the Internet, I had to uninstall Bitdefender.  I uninstalled other security programs and reinstalled Bitdefender three times, thinking that it would eventually work but it did not.  When I called the vendor from whom I purchased Bitdefender, they refunded my money."
"Traditionally, Painter has been bashed for having a poorly designed user interface that makes it difficult to use. However, being an artist who only wants to paint digitally, I find photoshop's interface and plethora of menus to be daunting. Corel 11 feels quite like Photoshop without all of the extra things I don't need, and I feel like the interface makes more sense than Photoshop. Very large brushes can be laggy, especially if you have a less powerful machine, but this shouldn't deter users without super computers from trying it out. Over all, I love this program. You don't have to know how to make your own brushes to get started and if you're moving over from Photoshop, many of the features are similar, if not the same."
"Just as described, installed works fine, saved me a boat load of money. Activated fine no issues."
Deceptive practices and plenty of Washington lobbyists to keep our taxes complicated.
"Easy to download and easy to use.  It is a great bargain having the subscription cover the 5 PC/MAC, 5 Smartphones, and 5 tablets.  The software works exactly as my experience on my office Mac.  I have found using the OneDrive allows me to easily continue revisions to EXCEL, WORD, and PowerPoint across all of my devices.  Great for productivity."
About a month i bought Roxio's Go Back and it saved my computer so after that success i decided to go ahead and try out Creator 5.  just like Go Back it turned out great.  They worked together fantastically.  I was able to back up my entire hard drive onto CD while Go Back kept my new files backed up.  i was also able to put my home movies from my digital camera onto CD which was very helpful in freeing up memory on my computer.  Great Product overall and I am impressed with Roxio all together.
"I had the 2009 Internet security version, tried the 2010 version as part of a free upgrade, didn't like certain problems, so went back to 2009.

I purchased renewal licenses for the 2009, then I get a message from Kaspersky a few days ago to the effect that Kaspersky will no longer provide daily definition updates, but that I can use my unexpired license time (about three months in my case) towards a newer version.

I download the 2012 version, enter my current key/license number and Kaspersky doesn't recognize that number or previous numbers.

I'm willing to eat three months if the trial 2012 version works okay.

NOT.

I have the three license version.  Full scan is reasonably fast on an ancient Windows XP desktop and a three-year old Vista desktop.  However, my Vista OS laptop with a dual-core AMD processor (not a performance star by any means, but not a total dog) takes about 18 hours to finish the scan of about 120 gigs of data.  This is with me not using the laptop and shutting down as many other programs as feasibly possible.

Fine.  Supposedly, Kaspersky has the software set up so that it won't look at the same files on subsequent scans if iList and/or iCheck is activated--which they are.

So now, while multitasking, Kaspersky is telling me it will need 5 days for the next full scan.

I decide to look at the Kaspersky forums--and I'm reminded of previous unpleasant experiences, namely receiving messages of ""flooding"" when I attempt a search.

This is way too much nonsense for one program.

I will not use Norton due to unethical practices in which they've engaged concerning previous purchases, but I will find something less aggravating than Kaspersky."
"Way too expensive and I hate how you can't buy Word on its own anymore. I prefer the Pages and Numbers programs that come FREE on new Macs. The Word interface in particular is way too ugly and cluttered, not very intuitive or enjoyable to use at all."
"I have used many different anti-virus/anti-malware security programs, but Webroot Secure Anywhere seems to be the fastest and most efficient. It does not slow down my computer when I am accessing different Web sites or checking my e-mail, and best of all, it runs completely invisible in the background. I would call it my ""Invisible Shield"" protecting my computer from any and all threats."
"As I suspected before ordering, my PC problem is too far gone for a band-aid, fix-it solution. This solution will probably work for a simple problem like a virus.  My problem is that my start-up files were corrupted so it will not even start correctly--."
so so
"Works great on Android. Small shied shows that it's active.
PC version doesn't show that it's active, but works well.  Just be be to check."
"I'm giving this item 3 stars since that seems to be a ""medium"" rating.  In actual fact I didn't even open the box.  When I ordered it from Amazon the price was $49.99 less a $45 rebate which would bring the final price to $4.99.  Not bad.  HOWEVER, when I read the fine print on the rebate sticker on the box (thankfully before breaking the seal) I discovered that the rebate reqest must be postmarked no more than 15 days from the date on the receipt.  Since the date on an Amazon packing slip is the date of the original order it was already too late to submit the rebate.  I phoned McAfee customer service and asked if an exception could be made.  After being given another number to call the answer was ""no.""  So I returned it.  It wound up costing me postage and I'm sure Amazon would have preferred to have a sale rather than a return.  I went to a store and bought Norton's equivalent software.  After their costing both me and Amazon time and money I at least deprived McAfee of the sale."
"I am a loyal Norton user.  I've used Norton SystemWorks (NSW) for many years, and have been consistently happy.  I'm running Vista Ultimate on a great computer (Pentium D Processor 940 at 3.2 Ghz, 4 GB RAM).  I downloaded NSW from Symantec's web site, but it won't install.  After expasperting sessions with ""English as a second language"" tech support, I was finally able to install the software.  After running several of the ""check/fix routines"" on NSW, many other programs did not work.  I had to reinstall at least five different programs.  I'm back to normal, thanks to back-ups I made on an external hard drive before installing NSW.  But, I am afraid to run the ""check/fix routines"" on NSW again until (or if) they fix the glitches."
"I prefer the SystemWorks Suite, containing Norton AntiVirus.  Go Back is the finest piece of software that Norton has ever offered (actually written by Roxio).  It should be part of the Windows operating system (we use Win 200 Pro).  It has saved thousands of dollars in lost time by bringing a crashed operating system back to a system state that was present before the crash.  It is an amazing piece of software and works flawlessly."
The Rule of Windows continues. Only every other Windows OS actually works. I will use this as long as I can.
"Does not support Nikon D3300 RAW files.  They come out pink and blurry.

And as they have just released PSP X7 (less than 12 months after X6), there is not much hope of the D3300 being covered by a software update.  You will have to buy PSP X7 for US$100."
Good install.
"avast! has kept me virus free, for free, for a very long time now. It's a great product and I highly recommend it."
"For this price, it is impossible to beat.  It just takes time to learn how to use it."
Software did the job but had more bugs than years past. Slow to start slow to save.
"free (extremely limited) use for a week or so, then promply becomes bloatware and nagware only capable of creating pop ups asking you to pony up for premium every ten minutes. would've considered paying if i wasn't so turned off by the business model. leave me alone."
"I've been using QuickBooks for over 10 years (started on version 4, I think) and just upgraded to 2011 from 2006. I have a VERY small business and don't actually use most of the functions of the software, but I needed some specific functions that Quicken or other accounting applications were unable to provide. Yes, it is more complex than Quicken, but it does a lot more.

The common functions that I use -- Create Invoices, Pay Bills, Item List, Account Ledger -- look about the same as 2006.

The install was incredibly simple via drag-n-drop to my Applications folder. Of the features that are ""new to me"" (though probably in previous versions): The ""Home Page"" makes some items that I commonly use easier to find than digging through menus. The Customer/Vendor lists are much better designed and more Mac-like than 2006, and I'm very excited about the Report Center which now provides images of sample reports, so you know what you're getting versus picking something by name and hoping it's correct. The UI for the Preferences window has also been updated to look more Mac-like, modeled on the OS X System Preferences window. I also set up and run an iDisk backup for the first time and it worked perfectly.

Otherwise, my 2006 data file converted without error and I find the general interface of the application to be very responsive.

If you have 2010, it's probably not worth upgrading unless there's specific new features (or bug fixes) that you're looking for -- I didn't see anything compelling to me listed on the box. But for older version like what I had, moving to a modern version can provide benefit, even if it's just for the interface tweaks."
"Garmin is a very good brand to go with. However, this update still doesn't have all the new roads in Columbus Ohio that where just built last year. Different exits as well. Otherwise a good product for my location."
"A great system for A cheap price. My basic requirements are fully met by A Linux system as I mostly surf the web and after A major hard drive crash I replaced my old drive with A SSD and this system as it's A 5 Y.O.  computer and I couldn't justify purchasing A copy of Windows 10 for it.
 Installed easy and works. That's all I can ask!!"
Not user friendly and poor technical support
"I'm an early user who upgraded from an HP Vista 64 system that I had been pleased with.  The install took a little more time than I had expected, and encouraged backup of all data which slowed things down more, but went very smoothly.  I have been operating for two months with no problems; not much different than Vista, but much faster to load and turn off.  I have heard reports of some video cards causing surprises, but mine is functioning perfectly. It probably pays to upgrade on a fairly new computer.  A good job, Microsoft!"
"Experienced dropped video, luminence problems.  Watching the tape was better, unfortunately.  Also the wires coming off the USB device were not real robust.  Could be problem down the road."
"The spreadsheets are easy to work with and help me keep all of my contact info and resources easy to find.
Love it."
"Worked just as promised. Package arrived earlier than expected. I'm currently running Mac OS X 10.11.3 on a hackintosh. I have heard that Pages 09 is better than the 2015 version. I have the option to upgrade to iWork 2015, but for now I'll stick with what I already have. Thanks again."

"JumpStart Reading with Karaoke starts with the basics - letters and sounds - and moves in a logical progression through phonograms and word families (e.g. cat, bat, mat, rat), letter blends and digraphs (e.g. tr and ck), sight words, and simple sentences. The program uses repetition, feedback, rhyming and rewards to reinforce the subject material through a series of 7-8 exercises and games repeated for each of 24 songs. All along the way, users are actively challenged to read, listen, speak and repeat new sounds and words.

Kids Appeal:

Our young testers generally liked JumpStart Reading with Karaoke. They liked it's interactivity, short exercises and variety, and they loved listening to recordings of their own voices. However, some of them exhibited difficulty with the karaoke portion of the program, because the songs were previously unknown to them, and as beginning readers they could not easily follow along with the lyrics on the screen."
"Love the application. I will be shooting more HDR in the future.
Arrived quickly as I recall."
It notably slowed down my computer.
"From AutoDesk's website. Receiving the dvd yielded version 5.0. If you click on updates in the help file you'll be taken to a page that contains two service pack options. While service pack 2 may be the only pack necessary, it may not have service pack one's improvements. You'll have to Uninstall the version you received from Amazon in order for the service packs to continue their installation. So install the Amazon dvd. Put the necessary numbers in, ie serial # and product code from the dvd box. Take a look at what you've got. Then uninstall it. Run the service pack you downloaded from the AutoDesk website. I ran service pack one first, and it installed to version 5.1. But service pack two would not install until I un-installed this 5.1 version. Apparently there is residual information still left on the computer so the AutoDesk service pack knows whether there's a legitimate copy, un-installed or not, so not to worry. However, you will have to re-type the serial # and product code for service pack two. But you'll be rewarded with extra colors, and apparently faster more efficient program as the byte count goes from over 200 megabytes down to around 70 with service pack two.
Keep track where you downloaded the service packs and have no fear of un-installing."
"Since installing Snow Leopard, I've gone through some good and some bad with it. On the good side, there's been a slight upgrade when it comes to speed. I seem to boot up more quickly than before. On the bad side, I lost the ability to scan with my HP all-in-one. After finally (after two weeks) finding someone at HP to help me, it was clear that Snow Leopard had caused the problem. In all, I'm very satisfied with this purchase."
Love it
"Having used Microsoft Streets since its first release, I was reluctant to even try another product.  I was grossly mistaken.  The learning curve (for me) was a slight bit slower than the old familiar ""Streets"", but now that I have been using DeLorme Street Atlas for a couple of months, I have deleted ""Streets"" and use DeLorme exclusively.  There are many extremely valuable tools (including a street level phone directory) and the routing options are far more comprehensive than those found in Streets.  I recommend this product to all those (myself included) who are directionally challenged!"
"By hwbryce
As a techie neophyte, I tried to build an author web site. I did not have the technical skills. Then I discovered Nitin Mistrys course How to Build Your Author Web Site  No Technical Skills Required. I now have an author web site. His course is brilliantly detailed and leads you, step by step, through all the phases of web-siting. I needed that. It was like Nitin was here holding my hand at every move. This was much more helpful to me than trying to follow the unfamiliar references on the other online course I tried to follow. He explained it and demonstrated it. Invaluable. I have no hesitation in highly recommending this course. Five stars."
Delivered in 2 days as promised! Works fine!
Good software. I bought it as a supplement and reference for our club annual journal printing design.
PS 4 offers less than half the abilities to create than previous versions.  I sent mine back to Encore/Borderbund for a refund.
"Download this and you may get nothing but frustration in trying to register it. Unless you register it you will not be able to use it and you need a serial number to register it. Its nearly impossible to find the damn serial number, and when you do it may not even be called a serial number, but a product number. Once you have it entered in the proper place, after a hour or so of trying to get that screen to come up, but then there is the likelihood that the registration process simply will not work.  Youve just spent 70 bucks and you have nothing.  Amazon credited me back for the loss, but they don't usually do that. I didn't have a functioning photoshop elements 13, but I did find a uninstall command that I used to get whatever remained of the worthless download off my computer. Adobe, of course, will never give anyone any support for this stupid thing. I have an older version of Photoshop elements that works just fine, and apparently thats all I will ever have. I don't remember it being so troublesome to download or install. By the way, before all the trouble I had the download took forever. Ive installed lots of software and never encountered anything so stubborn as this thing.  My computer is nearly new Macbook Pro."
i uninstalled  it and had a refund
"I am always on the lookout for non-shooter games for my kids that are compatible with Apple OS and this one is for sure a keeper!  I popped it into the laptop the first night after it arrived and played until 2am (how does time fly like that?)

I won't retell the story line or anything so dull.... You can read other reviews for that.
Give this game a try.  It is fun for kids and adults alike. My 11 & 13 year olds both defeated the game before I did, but then they both played it again with different strategy trying to beat their scores.  It also does not go on forever and ever in long boring quests.  It is a quick game that has doable levels and rewards as it moves along and keeps the player's interest.
Plus a few of the characters have little tidbits of trivia about chocolate history, so it is *mildly* educational.

I think this is a game that can be put away and revisited later and still give good play value.  The quests are just enough random that the game is not too overly predictable.

!! HOWEVER !!  We did experience a mid-game crash under OS 10.4.11.  I contacted the company via email and they responded quickly.  This is a known bug in the CD copy.  The cure for the crash is to download the online Mac version of the trial game over the already installed CD version..... that patched it up like a charm and it ran perfectly from that moment on.... the crash turned out to be a minor hiccup in game play.

The trial version/ game patch can be found free at PlayFirst(dot)com
Even though the trial version says it only runs for 60 minutes, the game has no such limit when patched over the CD version of the game.

Give this little gem of a game a try.  I plan on buying more games from this company,
Decent Mac games are hard to find and are usually overpriced, so this is a great find...."
"Used quicken for years, but unable to get rid of red flag in my checking account. All items have been acknowledged. Still there. Need better tech support."
This will identify and get rid of malware that your computer already has. Have done two scans in a months time and it has found and eliminated some malware.  Would love it if it could find and repair all the issues on my computer.
Some issues- mostly with outlook...cant sync my sticky notes and a few other little things missing- but works alright I guess. Still glad I switched from PC! (too many viruses!)
"I upgraded because I had to, (They would take away my ability to download transactions if I don't upgrade). I did so reluctantly, because I have a stable copy of quicken and the last time I upgraded I had a horrendous experience. As I feared, I immediately had a problem.  It locked me out of my data!!!!!!!
This reminds me of those criminals who invade your computer and hold it hostage until you pay a fee.
The error message I get is extremely unhelpful - See the attached screenshot.
I would tell you to not upgrade, but you have no choice if you want to download your transactions. Thank goodness another company had bought quicken. They cannot be any worse than Intuit!!!!

Update: After spending around an hour waiting for customer support, I finally got through to a support agent. It appears that the version of Quicken  that Amazon sells is out of date (R2) while the current version is R6. I installed the ""Mondo"" patch and it worked. So, the first thing you need to do when you purchase and instal this product is to go to [...]patch and install it. After than it will work much better."
"So far, so good. IRS has yet to publish several forms, as does the state of North Carolina. Will update review in January when updates are available and we do our taxes."
"I've benn using Norton Security for about (6) weeks. I am very happy with the product, and in particular its many user options, like password and credit card auto-entry and protection. Thank You."
"I hope it's as hard for others to get into as it was for me.  I downloaded the trial, liked it so bought this.  It installed easily and scanned fairly quickly, then sent me to website to register and create account.  It was picky about combination of characters but finally accepted, sent email providing me with link to complete activation.  First it wouldn't accept answer to security question so I had to change it, then it wouldn't accept security code, had to get another email link, wouldn't accept password.  Keep in mind that I had written these all on a pad, was carefully typing one finger at a time and you can't see what is typed, just the little dots.  I've spent the whole afternoon, including going through every .... ah, you don't want to hear all this.  It's a good program, but you have to activate your account to add the other devices and so far I haven't been successful.  I would probably give it a 5 if I could solve this but I'm tempted to give it one star."
"I have two laptops, a Mac and a Windows PC, both of the monitors needed color calibrating, the colors were always way too light with hardly any contrast at all. Luckily for me, I have a great printer, so my work always comes out the colors it should but what's printed out never looks like what I see on my monitors, until now! I was able to calibrate both of my laptops within 30 minutes. And the colors look great!! I'm a graphic/web designer and developer, so this product was absolutely essential! I definitely recommend it and at a later date, I plan on upgrading to higher level of Spyder. If you have the money and you are thinking about purchasing a product such as this one, choose Spyder2 Express, it's easy, fast, and it really works!"
Absolutely love it. So many up to date options that make all types of users able to do anything from recreational to business.
"We had a 90 day trial expire on a new pc we had bought. It had the Symantec Security Suite on it. Despite uninstalling and rebooting, we could not get the Amazon download of Norton's installation to load. After setting up a Norton account online, we contacted Norton's customer service and they emailed a link to us to install (very generic). It got us through the issue. Norton's online support was outstanding, but I work with pcs everyday and I thought this should have been easier for me, let alone a person who doesn't work with computers much. I read many posts of the same types of installation issues, so I wasn't surprised. I just thought my computer analyst background would have helped me through any issues that I encountered. When Symantec was quick to provide me that alternate link, I knew they had a bug and they knew about it. After seeing years are posts with the same issue, you would think that Symantec would have fixed the problem by now. That is why I only gave three stars. This was not Amazon's fault."
"I am requesting a refund of this piece of junk
I have been a loyal quicken user now for years..I downloaded this and had NOTHING but problems..
I uninstalled it and re-downloaded Quicken 2013..and that works fine"
great ''
I just love doing my taxes with this software. Have been doing it for years. Wish I could stop having so much fun.
"I just read the above review, and it explains a lot.  I too have tried it with Vista--in fact I got it when I got the computer.  I have had one problem after another:
1.  Wouldn't let me print- kept saying to set up printer.  It was set up for the computer, and I could not find anyplace in the software to re-set it up.
2.  Next day I tried to go into the program and got the message""Cannot find import DLL may be missing, corrupt or wrong version. So now I cannot get in to access my info.  And crazy me, I had imput all the information in back until the 1700s on the first day."
"If therebwas a way to give negative stars, that's what I would rate this transaction. Finally able to use the product, turns out the product activation key has been already used. Very disappointed in this as I have paid to get everything updated on my computer to find out that I now have to figure out how to activate Windows to for my computer to function. BUYER BEWARE!"
"Very fun, fact-filled interactive material!  Suitable for upper elementary kids.  Includes some goofy games, a ""where in the worlds did the Frizz go?"" and lots of click-on goodies.  Great way to play and learn!"
"My experience with this software has been pretty annoying. I have a Dual 2.7 GHz G5 PowerMac w/ 6GB of RAM. The previous version, Office 2004 was problematic for me, as Entourage would often crash, even if my machine was idle! I've noticed almost no improvement in performance with 2008. And my Entourage mail rules are now completely broken unless applied manually.

On top of that, launch times for Entourage are now about 3 times slower than in Office 2004, and I even took pains to delete tens of thousands of messages from my mail database. In addition, I've had problems with Entourage and Excel stalling my entire machine upon program launch (usually during the ""Optimizing Font Menu Performance"" stage - and I do have a ton of fonts activated for my graphics work). This problem usually requires a force-restart.

The software itself is fine, but not really much different than Office 2004, except for some minor aesthetic upgrades, some of which don't look all that great anyway.

To be fair, I also have this software installed on my Intel MacPro, and it launches and runs very responsively on that machine.

Let's hope MS fixes these issues... this software feels very much like it was rushed to market 6 months too early."
Best tax software for small biz! Can't beat Amazon price or service. 5 stars
I currently work full time in IT management.  I am working on a second degree in business in an online format.  There are no lectures in any of the classes that I take.  I use this series of lectures as a replacement for the lack of class lectures in my degree program and this series works very well.  The lectures cover different areas of business and mesh with every business course I have taken very nicely.  It makes learning business fun and interesting.  I highly recommend whether it is for a class or personal interest.  Excellent course!!
"My consulting business is based on time billing, and now I can bill time, invoice by email, and track conversations ALL from Outlook. If I schedule an appointment, or track my time in Outlook, I can mark the time as billable, create an entry, and the info flows directly into my accounting software.
My ability to invoice by email had expired with QuickBooks, so I had switched to using PDFRedirect to print pdf files instead and emailed them. I was not eager to spend hundreds of dollars on an upgrade, when what I had was working fine until one of their updates turned off a feature I needed. Now it's not a problem, and the new solution actually works better because I can run the whole time billing side of my consulting business from Outlook.
I had recently tried SugarCRM, but the open source version doesn't handle billing. Small Business Accounting 2006 has the best features of CRM, with Opportunity tracking, what's in the pipeline, etc. PLUS the best features of QuickBooks for considerably less.
Unknowns: What happens at tax time?
Untried: Payroll with ADP
Wishes: a tick mark of some kind in Outlook to show that a calendar entry HAS been sent to the accounting software for billing.
ELEVEN MONTHS LATER: 1)My clients need dates to show for each item in my service invoice for their accounting - there is no way. 2)After restoring from a backup after a computer crash, all sorts of wierdness happened - previously invoiced items show not invoiced, etc. 3)I'm starting to feel tired of fighting the software. Template changes don't stick. 4)I wish QuickBooks worked with Outlook. I'm ready to go back."
"Was able to activate Microsoft Office 2016 Home & Student. Just a note to anyone having a problem with this Product Key, you must have a Microsoft account to use it.  First set up a Microsoft Account. Also, the software must be downloaded and installed first into your computer. The only function of a Product Key is to activate the software once it has been installed in your computer.

My computer came pre-installed with a trial version of Office 365, which is a subscription-based software.  As I did not want to pay every year for Office, I decided instead to get a permanent installation of Office 2016 Home & Student. Upon entering the Product Key number, I was prompted to activate Office 2016 Home & Student instead of Office 365, and this seems to have worked out fine.

Upon starting up Word or Excel, I see a brief ""Office 365"" logo on the screen, and then it opens Word 2016 or Excel 2016 instead.  Upon checking the actual version of the software (in Word or Excel go to File and then Account), I was informed that it is indeed Office 2016 Home & Student and not Office 365.

Hope this helps."
"Most of these reviews I see here are very suspicious.  Either 5 stars and you love it or 1 star and you hate it worse than the plague.  Maybe Amazon can post your IP addresses again, and all will become clear.
I have downloaded the LiveEval disk from SUSE, and have installed 9.1 on no less than 3 completely different systems from the same CD... they are:
My home-built work system -
abit IC7MB, 3.0 Ghz P4 w/ Hyperthreading, Seagate SATA HD, 2 EIDE HD's, CD/DVD reader, CD/DVD Writer, HP scanner, Sony monitor, USB mouse and keyboard, 3COM NIC, ATI Radeon 9800.
My wife's Gateway
My Compaq at work
Each and every install performed flawlessly.  I had no problems with any of the included software, and every piece of hardware on all systems was found and configured correctly with the following exceptions:
Sound cards were not always recognized.  However, after telling Yast to re-probe the hardware (one time) everything worked correctly.  Also, still working on finding video drivers from ATI, however, you can download them free on ATI's web site.
I was very pleased with the installer, KDE interface, the software included, and the overall experience of all of the installs.
some more tips:
1) Like other reviewers here have said over and over again, do your homework BEFORE you try installing this.  Make sure your hardware is supported, or if it's not, decide if this is something you would be willing to live with while running Linux.
2) Download and install the Live Eval disk from [...] -  while this will not give you a 100% complete picture of how your system will function, it will give you enough information upon which you can base an informed decision.  Remember: the live eval is free (and will not change your hard drive whatsoever).  Your time/frustration/windows partitions are not free.
3) If at all possible, DON'T INSTALL LINUX IN THE SAME PARTITION AS WINDOWS!!  If you like it enough, go out and buy a cheap 20GB hard drive, or at the very least create an empty FAT32 partiion on your hard drive before you attempt an install Linux."
I wanted to start something in graphic art but I didn't want to spend a fortune especially if I would stop after a while. This is a very good set that makes you start with basic software then you can expand from here with latest versions and other tools as you see fit. Anime studio 9 is amazing and there is so much on YouTube to learn from.
"I have had all the protection software over the years. None of them has done the total job. This product is so great in all that it says it will do. After installation, registration, and first run through it found 18 entries that it swiftly and completely wiped out. Kudos to the designers, worth every penny spent."
"good for the money, but lacked items in the library. I had v8 which was easier to use-designed my house with it. Also hard to move the items
around and hard to put on an angle. I can't get my plan to look like the one an the box (can anybody???)"
"Program works well & is easy to use, but extra charge for filing state tax was a nasty surprise."
"I received the ROXIO VHS to DVD  software for Christmas.  I have tried repeatedly to get the program to install.  It will load half way and then stops.  Trying to get a response from the ROXIO Techs was a total waste of time--they don't answer their mail.  Consequently, I've given up on the ROXIO Easy VHS to DVD software (because the software is anything but easy).  What did I learn from this exercise--NEVER BUY ROXIO.  Poor software and Poor support.  I've removed all ROXIO products from my computer and wouldn't own anything from ROXIO even if it was given to me for free.  To ROXIO:  Shame on you for taking people's money and giving them junk without support.  You give the term ""Buy American"" another black eye.  Your practice of accepting money for garbage software is the same as stealing.  I hope people wake up to your practices and put you out of business by buying elsewhere.

"I bought this version off the internet and it never functioned properly. I tryed to run ""Liveupdate"" numerous times without success. This wasted many hours of my time. (Without liveupdate the software is not kept current and becomes worthless.) Then I went to Symantec's website and wasted another 45 minutes trying to locate the technical support phone number (the extended package that I had bought included free technical support -- apparently you just have to invest an hour or so of your time to actually extract the phone number from the company.) After spending 2 1/2 hours between many phone calls to the support line, the problem was never resolved. The company did say they would refund my money in full (my fingers are crossed). I calculate that I wasted about 10 hours or so over a frustrating period of 3 months. Don't buy this product and spare yourself the pain."
"As a 79 year old student of French in Australia I highly recommend the combined written & spoken course by Christian Aubert titled ""Smart French"". He leads the student through the many contexts in perfect spoken French emphasising the importance of the difference between written & French as spoken by an educated Frenchman. By constant repetition & the student's speaking aloud at his prompting one soon finds oneself understanding the text without reading it. He also comments on Liason & idiomatic phrases which are very useful. Lastly we hear the interviewees original spoken texts with all the pauses common in conversation. I can now understand the original speakers who are nowhere as clear as the author's diction. You will even hear a sneeze & the idiomatic French response to this. It's worth getting & studying repeatedly.  Michael Hubert (Queensland)."
"Works great for simple (my son's) or complex (mine).  Audit check has never failed me as I have been using TaxCut for over 12 years now, even before it was H&R Block."
This is the ninth year to use H&R Block software but I encountered a problem this year that could not be resolved.  The state e-flie was rejected twice.  The error report stated that the problem had been corrected and all I needed to do was update the software.  I tried to update the software but it said no updates available and no more updates expected.  I had to print and mail the state return.
This product didn't download.
I have used Turbotax since the 1990's.  It walks you through the process and explains it well.  The online donation portion is a great feature to keep track of donated items.  Highly recommended.
"Intuit, the maker of TurboTax 2002 has betrayed you, and me, the average home user of their software. They've betrayed our trust, my friend. Intuit has sneakingly snuck into their software, without telling you, a product activation feature, and a copy protection program. THIS IS SPYWARE. They vigorously deny that they have added spyware to their software. BULL. Spyware, in my definition is an EXTRA program that is installed when the program that you pay for is also installed. It is installed WITHOUT telling you, and without the option to not install it. And that is exactly what the company that we foolishly supported for so long has done. I strongly, vigorously urge all of you to NOT buy this program. H & R Block's Tax Cut 2002 is as much so, if not more capable than turbo tax. Both will give you the SAME result, the maximum refund, or minimum taxes due. Tax Cut has an interface which is easier to navigate, and does all the same things, without the added bloatware/spyware. They ALLOW you to install it on multiple home computers. Let's fight back against this ... ... Buy Tax Cut - it's written by the real tax pros, and it doesn't have the spyware."
Apple won't accept the serial number so iWork won't run. Also I think Apple doesn't support this old version so it is not valid.
Can't change date format in Excel!!!!  You kidding me?  And why change everything so that we have to relearn how to used this junk?  The head of MS's Office development team should be taken out and hanged!!!!
"I searched other websites including Microsoft's own, and couldn't find a cheaper of more reliable source for this software. It's hard to beat Amazon's price and service."
"We also have used Turbotax for the past 8+ years with good success; we like the ease of doing it at home, on a Sunday or whenever we can fit it in.  But it ended up costing more than going to a professional this year.  Yup, you pay the $ for the program, then the $ filing fee (friends have since told me that there's a link on the IRS site to file for free), then some bank in California gets a $ handling fee!!  Last year we got our return deposited in 4 days.  This year the ""bank"" emailed us stating it would take 2+weeks for them to receive the return and send it on to us.  Makes me wonder why it takes so much longer for them to ""handle"" my return, and maybe how much they made on my money while they handled it before depositing it into my bank (which they did, to the exact predicted date - 2 weeks after filing).  At least we can write off the fees next year.  So, save yourselves the $$ and go elsewhere.  We will next year."
I read the reviews and took a chance and so far so good. I mainly use the software for burning data CD's and it works great. I will update my review if I run into any problems.
Nice
"I bought H&R Block tax software after using it last year. This year, I had my return completed but TaxCut kept giving me verification errors because of entries on the Obamacare 1095A form. After a google search, I saw they had problems with this last year with a few from this year. I downloaded TaxAct, but hated the interface and the upgrade nags, so I downloaded TurboTax from Amazon. I completed myfederal and state returns without and problems..i.e. no verification errors or errors of any kind.

I had switched to Taxcut last year, after the TurboTax fiasco, but Taxcut has lost me for good. TaxCut has been a good product, but TurboTax is much more pleasant to use. With the tax program hassles I experienced  the last couple of years, returning to doing taxes by hand is looking better and better."
"The new 2009 Mac Pros have no firewire 400 ports, and a number of the add-in cards in the market work poorly in a Mac. This card, however, seems to work just fine. It installs in about a second and needs no drivers. Both ports become immediately available.

I've been testing mine with an iSight camera and a Lexar compactflash card reader. Given an ultra II compact flash card rated to ""minimum 9MB/second,"" I was able to copy a 1.90GB file at a pace of 9.2 MB/second. This is only about 20% the theoretical speed of a firewire 400 port, but I don't have any higher speed firewire device handy on which to apply tougher testing.

Note that the card does not support Target Disk Mode on the Mac."
Great program!
"I bought this software to transfer vinyl records to CD.
I previously had B's Recorder Gold which is simple and reliable.
Step 1 - I uninstalled Gold.
Step 2 - I installed Roxio.
Step 3 - because Roxio did not recognize my CD-RW, I downloaded the Roxio patch for Roxio.
Step 4 - because Roxio still did not recognize my CD-RW, I downloaded the Roxio patch for the CD driver.
Step 5 - because windows now no longer saw my CD drive, I emailed Roxio.
Step 6 - because Roxio after various iterations told me it was a W2000 problem, I emailed microsoft as advised.
Step 7 - because I have a Dell, I emailed Dell because MS told me that OEM systems were only supported by the supplier.
Step 8 - I got numerous emails back from Dell, which not only did not solve the problem, but in most cases did not even relate to the question. Eventually Dell said that they would not tell me how to replace the driver, because I had a CD-RW and not the CD-R that my system shipped with. ( it is the same driver ). They could not tell me how to replace the driver - the Dell resource CD for restoring portions of windows only includes custom Dell drivers.
Step 9 - I reinstalled W2000 and Roxio, on the assumption that Gold was not fully removed on last install.
Step ... - reinstall W2000 again, and Roxio.
Step I lost track - finally got Roxio up, but it will not see my sound card. I uninstalled everything of Roxio except what I wanted i.e. the software to break record into tracks, and even this won't work.
Final Step - the record player sits beside my machine. I records sit in the cupboard. I use Gold for backups, and love it."
Great protection.
"Dragon for Mac has internal conflicts with Word for Mac that causes computer crashes and SLOWNESS.  I have recommended to Amazon that they stop selling this product because it is defective.  I did not have problems with SLOW Mac or Mac CRASHING before I added Dragon to my Mac.

I had a MacBook and bought Dragon 2 for Mac and the problems began.  The problem was when I used Dragon and Word, XL and Photoshop were open.

Mac tech support (via tel and Genius Bar) tried to figure out the problem.  Over more than a year trying to FIX the problem under AppleCare: Apple reloaded my operating system, Nuance reloaded Dragon, Apple told me to buy more RAM - bought 4 GB more on top of the 4 I had, Apple told me to buy a powered USB hub (I did; I need a 'natural' keyboard and mouse)... problem still not fixed after each of these attempted fixes.

NEXT Apple thought maybe my hard drive was failing and they replaced my hard drive.  NEXT the speculation was that since my MacBook was older - maybe the processor was too slow.  Nuance said that Dragon 3 was more efficient and buying DD3 would help. To use DD3, I needed to upgrade my operating system on the MacBook or buy a new Mac.

FINALLY a bought a new MacMini with Mountain Lion and bought DD3 from Amazon.  Now, I have faster core processor, newer MAC OS, and newer DD3.  At the advice of Apple - I did NOT move applications from the old computer to the new.  All apps were installed on the Mini directly from original CDs.  Photoshop 4 discs are hiding somewhere in my office so I bought mini-photo edit software SnapHeal, Pixelmator, etc.to replace PhotoShop.  I was NEVER a power PS user... but this added MORE COST to solving my Dragon Dictate for Mac problem.

You guessed it - NEW COMPUTER - NEW OS - NEW DD3 - same problem with computer crashing and grinding to a halt.

Last night, I took the new computer to the Apple Store and the Genius Bar technician opened: Applications>Utilities>Activity Monitor and we watched Word, XL, Pixelmator all work properly.  Then we opened Dragon Dictate - all still fine except Word went NUTS - using 104% of the CPU capacity - even when nothing was being dictated and on and on. The mini also ran HOT to the touch when Dragon was loaded - not good for the computer.

Having problems with Dragon Dictate 2 or 3 for MAC crashing and slowing your computer?  GO TO Applications > UTILITIES > Activity Monitor... LOOK at Word's CPU usage when Dragon is Loaded.  SEE the problem right before your eyes.

Nuance should refund the cost of Dragon2 for Mac and Dragon3 for Mac to anyone who has bought it and also uses MS Word for Mac.  It is defective software."
"This software is great! Easy to install and a great price on Amazon.
Highly recommend!"
"I purchased Adobe Premiere Elements 12 a ways back, and also have Corel Video Studio Pro X8. I acquired Cyberlink Power Director 14 Ultimate because of its compatibility with Windows 10. As the description states, World's Fastest Rendering -TrueVelocity 5 leverages hardware and software technologies to speed up video processing and outperform all others. TrueVelocity is optimized for modern CPU and GPGPU hardware platforms from Intel, AMD and NVIDIA to maximize memory allocation and usage. So it is compatible with all three manufacturers Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA of display adapters.
My Adobe Premiere Elements 12 is not compatible with Windows 10, at least not in every function, but fortunately Corel Video Studio Pro X8 has released a free update to 8.5 which is. This Cyberlink Power Director 14 is being released as a designed for Windows 10 piece of software from the get go.

When I first got Corel X8 I was pleased that it had an easy-peasy video editor option that made it a candy walk to create a video right out of the box. This Cyberlink Director 14 has an equivalent easy editor. That probably has a lot to do with the instant results, and wall to wall 5 star reviews of those stating how easy it is to use out of the box. Others who delve into the more complex functions of video editing, and are frustrated that they cannot master it right away are those who are slamming the software with low star ratings. If you want a fully featured program that does incredible things, and enables you to do things that you simply cant do with for example Windows Movie Maker then there is going to be a learning curve.

The thing I love the most about CPD 14 is that you can edit this with 4 different camera angles. I have multiple high def. cameras, some more expensive than others, and I know how great it is to have different angles to capture the excitement of a scene. When a scene is captured using just one angle it creates boredom for the viewing audience. Having a multiple method option for synchronizing all 4 whether it be automatically through the audio track, or by markers that you can set and tweak using right and left arrows controlling individual frames etc. is an option that is worth the price of admission.

Much is said about the lack of an owners manual and not without merit. But with the price of the manual to print, and then the large increase in shipping such a product compared to a simple disc in a light box it makes the lack thereof a smart move. Having a digital manual is just as convenient except for those who stubbornly hold onto having to have a book on the desk. To be honest I wish all of my books were scanned so my entire library would take up zero shelf space in the FireHDX. With the split screen in Windows 8 + you can divide a good sized monitor into the right half, and left half, and operate both programs at once without even having to bring them back up; they just stay there. Anyhow you shouldnt have to change your computer in order to use some software but on the other hand all software these days doesnt come with a written manual so get over it.

A really cool tool is all of the videos you can find on You Tube where they take you through certain functions right on the screen. There is no better learning tool than to see it being done. A picture really does say a thousand words. Also Cyberlink has online help both in the way of information, as well as providing a forum that is filled with information from those who have been using the program, and are willing to help. So you can look something up quickly, or even make your own post about how to do something, and watch the CL community come to the rescue.

Right now this is #9 in video editing software in the ASRs - Amazon Sales Ranks. Thats a lofty spot because every other contributor in video editing software above it are all cheapy versions. So this is the number 1 video editor over $100; that is saying something. It even beats out Adobe Photoshop & Premiere Elements in the over one hundred dollar category. Right now it is actually priced the same.
It comes with 2 discs containing more extra add-ons then you could ever use. They are offered to you individually when you load the program, or should I say after loading the program, they want you to do that first. So if you don't want the wedding videographer suite of tools you don't have to load them.

No wonder it earned PC Magazines Editors Choice award beating out all others. In the words of PC magazine, BOTTOM LINE- Power Director continues to outflank the competition, with top rendering speed, a massive set of video editing tools, the latest file-standard support, and a wealth of new features in its latest update.""
Buy it."
Does not perform. Update has virus that avast and avg stops and disables program.... trying to get refund.
"I am a longtime user of Quicken to track my checking account activity.  2011 version is the best I've used todate.  It downloads my bank transactions, updates my checking account and balances my entries.  At the present time there is no other program on the market that will do that for me.  The newest acquisition by Intuit called ""Mint"" is close but not as complete and misses a running balance on the transaction screen like Quicken.  I maintain hardcopies by the month of my transactions and the reports that run on Quicken are easily run.  What would make more sense would be for the banks to provide a software package that can access your current activity in real time and maintain a similar checkbook style screen for their customers.  So far Quicken 2011 is unbeatable.  Ed Piotroski"
"I bought this product after reading about AVG and its glowing reviews.  However, I had a problem with the install on my second computer.  The firewall simply would not install.  I tried the online fixes at AVG's Website but none of them worked.

I had to email ""customer support,"" since apparently AVG is too cheap to provide a phone number.  Someone named Lakshmi, I am sure from India, emailed me back but his fix did not work.

I would recommend Trend Micro over this want-to-be anti-virus.  Trend has toll-free technical support and you get to speak with a live body, instead of being hung out to dry with second-rate support from India!"
big fan of this service
I wouldn't be able to write all of these online reviews as quickly if I hadn't bought this! I love it and it's a very easy and fast way to learn to type.

 Awesome upgrade, October 29, 2009

I knew from the day that I installed the Windows pre-beta copy of Windows 7 that I received at a Microsoft event almost a year ago that Windows 7 was going tos bea huge improvement over Vista and XP. The first machine that I installed it on was a Lenovo T43 laptop. This machine could not reasonably run Vista (from a clean install)...I could not even surf the web on it. I installed a clean version of 32-bit Win7 on this machine and it turned it into a new machine. I did not have to download a single driver to get it to work and the whole install took less than a half an hour. Now this machine is perfectly functioning and I can use it to surf the web and stream youtube videos, etc. If you want to take full advantage of all the graphical elements in Windows 7 you will need more hardware power, but the point is that Windows 7 tends to upgrade your machine because of all the incremental performance enhancements that were made to the operating system.

I have installed Windows 7 on probably about 20 machines in the last year and I have not had any issues with it not installing drivers. That is good because I suggest you do a clean install. When I decided to upgrade my office machine back in August I used the File and Setting Transfer Wizard to back up all my programs and settings to a external drive and then did a clean install, then restore my programs and settings. This worked better than I expected it would. Almost everything I needed was where it should have been. The few things that were missing still could be found on my hard drive. I ran into one problem where I tried to upgrade from Vista to Windows 7. There was a problem late into the install process that force the Windows 7 install to be rolled back. It is due do some driver/service/hardware not acting the way it should that causes this, but it is happening to a few people out there I know. The good thing is that if there is a problem like this your original OS is restored perfectly.

There is not a lot of new features in the operating system. Some of my favorites are the new mobile broadband (cellular) integration into the wireless network user interface. You don't have to install a cumbersome application from the cellular card maker anymore (if you have a card that supports the new driver model) and you cellular driver doesn't install all the extra COM ports. Also, I really like how they handle the taskbar when you have more than one of the same application running. When you click on it you get a small screenshot of the application (if you have the aero theme support, otherwise it is more textual). This also works great with IE, because all the tabs are show no matter how many instances of IE are running at the same time. I hated trying find tabs if you have multiple instances of IE running that multiple tabs open in each of them...this problem is fixed now. Finally, XP mode is a nice feature that you can have with a little setup work. It allow you to run a virtual XP machine inside Windows 7. It takes a little work to setup and doesn't run you application as fast as they would natively. You need a faster CPU and extra memory if you plan on using this a lot. But, hopefully the average user doesn't need to use this.

So far, I have not found any application that ran on Vista that don't run on Windows 7.

Also, if you plan on using more than 3 GB of RAM you need to buy a 64-bit version of Windows 7.

Hope this helps."
"I have 3 laptop PC computers and 7 iOS devices.  I needed to renew my subscription to Norton 360, and decided to go with Norton Security Premium based on the very clear statement that it could protect up to 10 devices, including iOS.  After downloading NS Premium on my computers, I started to download the iOS app, but then noticed the Apple Store reviews that complained about NS not providing anything for iPhones and iPads except for backup of contacts and ""find my device"" capability--both of which are already provided by Apple.  This is extremely deceptive, and cost me an additional $6 over the $34.99 I would have spent for 15 months of NS Deluxe on Amazon.  I contacted Norton and they extended my subscription by an additional 36 days (30 days plus the 6 days I had remaining on my 360 subscription when I activated the NS Premium).  Nice of them, but the deceptive advertising speaks very poorly of Norton, and frankly makes me suspect of their corporate integrity.  My years of experience using Norton products has been generally very positive, and I expect to continue to be satisfied with the product.  But I am disappointed in this experience, and have downgraded the product accordingly."
"This was another wonderful game of my childhood and really enjoyed it, and I am glad to be playing it again after all these years."
"I have used a cheaper and easier to use CAD program for years.  I needed to load it on a new laptop and found that it been scratched.  I needed to purchase a new CAD program and found Trubo CAD 14.  Don't be fooled ... this is a hard program to learn.  But it does so much more than what I was used to using. It comes with a pretty good tutorial CD (several hours).  After watching about a third of the tutorial CD I was able to draw, in detail, plans for a new backyard BBQ bar area for my contractor and it came out pretty good if I do say so myself. If you need a CAD program and have the time and mind to learn this program ... you'll love it!!!"
Purchased a 2009 Family Tree Maker.  Used it for 2 days and then I could no longer use it.  Have contacted Ancestry.com & family tree maker for assistance and they still have not been able to get this working.  When I go in on family tree maker get a message family tree maker encountered an error and needs to close for 2008 & 2009.  Have not been able to use the product so what do I do?
"The program does quite well what it need to do but it costs way to much. When you start to use new labels or a new label printer or a new operating system chances  are that you need to buy an upgrade. I wend from version 3 to 4 to 5 each time an other investment of 19,95 euro's. Now I'd need to buy an upgrade again because I needed to buy a new printer. But the program that comes with my canon printer is actually easier for designing labels then Surething."
"No More Typing!!!!!  This product is excellent. If you have any problems with your wrist or your typing ability, being slow or uncoordinated, then this is the  product for you. You can do all kinds of things with this including writing this review. You can do e-mail, statements and so on. You need patience, though to fully train the Dragon. Overall it is very easy to tame. All you need to do is take your time and understand the inner workings of the Dragon, it is very easy to do as everything is explained very clearly . Once you get this in your hands won't want to let it go. For the most part your typing days will be over.
COMPUTIAC"
This is the 3rd update I have purchased and I always have problems getting the new software to work properly. Last time it was issues with the transfer of files getting corrupted. I like the software but it needs improvements including more font selection. Too far in to change to another software package. It works great once the bugs are lined out.
Super!
"Pros:
This was the best price I could find.
It is windows and works.

Cons:
I'm frustrated that I can only instal it on one machine. I have 2 work machines and am surprised how often I am using them simultaneously.  It would be nice to have identical software on both.

Other thoughts:
I think the Metro interface is interesting.  However I use it virtualized on my mac and have no need for the experience just the software it lets me use.  If I used windows regularly I would probably choose this over Windows 7.  I'm all about some touch interface.  Metro worked great with my apple track pad."
"Was using 2003 Version without any problems.  Removed 2003/Installed 2006, would not work properly.  Removed 2006/Used Nortons tech support web tools to remove and clean all versions/Reinstalled 2006, still would not work properly, did this several times.  Ended up using the 2003 after it reinstalled with another year of updates but now must do updates manually because automatic updates shows to update but doesn't.  This is terrible product, setting on shelf not using and has already been activated, waste of money.  To get live tech support you must pay, why should I pay money to get a product to work I just payed $ to purchase?  VERY POOR PRODUCT AND SUPPORT."
It has turned into an ala carte profit machine and doesn't natively work with any of my major banks...they charge a subscription now but if I used Quicken it would be free.
"I could NOT get it activated. Sent AVAST 6 emails over 5 days. Kept telling me they will get back to me, then radio silent. I am asking for a refund. Somehow I did not get an email with an activation code, but they got my money."
"It misses a few functions, but at the price it is a great deal.  All the key wordperfect features are there."
Brought an XP machine back to life
"CONSUMER REPORTS (SEPTEMBER/2007) LOVES PC-CILLIN INTERNET SECURITY SUITE 2007. THAT'S MY REASON FOR THE 5 STARS. BUT,THEY ONLY RECOMMEND SUITES FOR PC'S WITH 1 GIG MEMORY OR BETTER."
"I purchased the ""Dragon"" for my grandson, a high school student with diagnoses of dyslexia and dysgraphia. He is very pleased with this
device and has shown increased motivation in completing his assignments."
"Consistently cannot connect to my accounts at one supported institution, and when it does ""successfully"" connect it erroneously reports a zero balance for the accounts. This is a CC-501 error on the Quicken server, not anything with the financial institution itself. I contacted support and was told to forward two logs to them, one of which contained unencrypted bank account numbers and full 16 digit credit card numbers.

Edit: I dropped my review from 2 to 1 stars because now I cannot connect to an account I was able to connect to successfully before."
I hate it. I used earlier versions and they worked fine. This vision is a nightmare. Before you just selected the card type and it would show all four pages and you just put what you wanted on the page and printed. Now it just shows a page and you can't select the card type or know what you are going to print.
enter @ your own risk........
"I am a long-term Quicken user and found the product to be about the same as 2010.  One major loss, however, is the budgeting process.  The budget is now much more difficult to use and the overall perspective is almost eliminated.  It is much less effective as a management tool.  In Quicken 2010, the ability to see the overall, but drill down to detail was very good.  Now one must generate a separate budget report just to get any sense of the overall budget.  There are some totals shown, but even they do not add up, a embarrassing flaw for a financial program.  In short, the budget is poorly executed.

Overall, the software loaded fine and transferred data fine, so perhaps the early data flaws are gone.  I essentially paid a 3-year license fee by the required upgrading, which is okay. It is worth it for a very complete package.  Still, a good competitor is surely missed."
"When importing my financial statements, Money requests that I click 'yes' for each transaction. I am importing transactions for the last 6 years. I'll need to click 'yes' thousands of times. The people who have designed this piece of software obviously never used it in real life."
didnt work well. had to uninstall.
"I had Norton 2006. Then I updraded my PC from XP to Vista Home Premium and was in the market to look at Vista-compatible antivirus (primarily, since Windows Firewall is now 2-way and good enough in Vista).

I actually bought Norton Internet Security 2007 but couldn't get to install it on Vista; so returned it.

I went online to the onecare.live.com site to download the trial version. it installed in a breeze without any issues. Ran a complete scan and felt it was actually a bit faster than Norton Internet Security 2006. It also had other goodies like auto-defragmentation, backup, tune up etc. Nice value. There are claims out there that other anti-malware programs may catch more viruses, worms, spyware, etc but I think for those who use common sense and fair caution on internet and email, OneCare is great (more than adequate).

I plan to now convert the trial version to fully licensed version. It integrates with Vista so well that it is not intrusive at all.

Now what I wish OneCare did better or differently:

- Backup program should have given more and easier options to select which folders/files I want to backup. They could have simply borrowed the backup interface (at least for advanced users) from Windows XP."
Didn't work Vista to Vista --- may work to 7 -No way to tell- Don't have 7!!!
Great product
"PaintShop Pro X5 Ultimate is a good photo editing software. The two add-ons, NIK Color Efex Pro 3.0 photographic filters and REALLUSION FaceFilter Studio 2 are the older version of each product. The Nik Color Efex Pro software installed fine. The FaceFilter Studio 2 software would not install, requiring my attempt to obtain support.

The support person was condescending in the response. I finally found that the FaceFilter Studio 2 install form required a non-blank character (any character except a space) in the Company name field of the install form to actually begin the install. The support person either did not know of the requirement, or did not deem the information important when responding."
Amazing program. The only thing it lacks is more options to change fonts and colors if you like to personalize.
"Windows 8 is noticeably faster than Windows 7. The install process is easy and painless.

I installed Windows 8 on a year old i7 laptop and a several year old core 2 duo, neither has a problem running Windows 8. Battery life on the i7 laptop is excellent.

There isn't a steep learning curve for Windows 8. The start screen is simply a more informative version of the start button.

I have no interest in apps. A good browser is the only app I need.

Try it you just might like it. I find myself missing Windows 8 when I'm using the computer at work."
Great format ! I highly recommend.
No use for me !
It is simple to use
"I had used TT for several years, but on this download...suddenly my 20 year old full time student son that made no income was  locked in as a 'nondependent'...Yikes! After jockeying all my inputs that lead to the exemption I was due, the TT still had 'nondependant' locked in... After a conversation with an accountant friend of mine, I tried the freebie TaxAct program and got the exemption I deserved... a $4,000 difference! So-Long Turbo Tax!"
"If you have 1099-B forms in your tax return, this is the version of TurboTax you need to use. The software lets you select which information you want to enter, or can guide you through the entire entry process. Cost aside, this version is still pretty good."
"We love Student Writing Center at our house.

It's easy for children to use and grown ups who aren't as comfortable with other word processing products.  I often wonder why THE LEARNING CENTER (if they're still around) don't offer support and new editions.  This word processing software is worth having.

It's simple to use and offers wonderful options for REPORTS, NEWSLETTERS, PERSONAL LETTERS, SIGNS, and even has a password protected PERSONAL JOURNAL.

Saving your work is easy and actually automatic (you can change the saving intervals from every 5 minutes to longer - and make it automatic or on approval).

I've homeschooled for years and I've NEVER seen anything that touches STUDENT WRITING CENTER.  What it does -- it does well.

I recommend having a CD to re-install, if necessary.  And save your TLC files on a USB Travel Drive or Memory Stick if you don't want to lose them.  (You know how computers crash and burn sometimes.)"
This is the best address book I have ever used!  It holds more information than any other program and is very easy to use.  I would highly recommend it to anyone for home or office.
Did not have any issues loading software/deleting old one
Had to return it.
"This product is for the person who knows exactly nothing about playing a violin.  It starts with the basics and works its way up.  This is exactly what I was looking for.  You can spend as much time on each lesson as you wish.  I have not completed all of the lessons, so I don't know how advanced the lessons get."
"Now I didn't buy Windows 8 Pro from Amazon, actually. I bought it from Microsoft, and had a discount from the Windows Upgrade Offer (Got my copy for my Acer Aspire M5-581T, which is eligible for this offer). I was glad I got Windows 8 Pro because I was able to get Windows Media Center free of charge after the upgrade, and still be able to play DVDs on this laptop.

The upgrade process, I will tell you, was pretty rough, and man I mean rough. I did get an error while it was copying files but it continued to install (maybe a minor glitch), it rebooted, and Windows 8 got everything set up. No BSODs or anything (thank god). Thankfully, it did keep every setting I had on like the upgrade promised. I gone ahead and checked to make sure everything worked (drivers and anything else like that). Almost everything worked, except the Wi-Fi. That's right, the internet stopped working after the upgrade, and was the only real way to activate Windows. The Wi-Fi driver reinstall stalled while in the normal Windows environment, but in Safe Mode (which the method to get into that has changed, btw, no longer are we hitting F8 to open that faithful menu to bring us Safe Mode), the drivers installed fully, and I rebooted into the normal environment, and the internet worked once again. Sound worked, but the lil piece that came with my laptop for the sound, Dolby Home Theater, didn't. Had to uninstall that and reinstall. Graphics drivers were ones shipped from Microsoft, and I swapped that as fast as possible with proper drivers. Everything went back to normal, and my computer adjusted to Windows 8. The OS was completely stable after that.

Using the OS took some getting used to. Luckily I was able to try out the Release Preview on a virtual machine before getting the final release to get a chance to play with the new interface, the Metro UI and stuff like that. I know most were complaining that Microsoft removed the Start button from the taskbar and the old start menu, and replaced that with the Metro Start Menu (or Start Screen), and I know how that feels, but hey, given patience, using the Start Screen in Windows 8 will be as intuitive as using the old-fashioned Start Menu in previous versions, plus this at least gives the OS some more eye candy, and I'm also quick to adapt to new things. It's kind of sad though that Microsoft removed certain pieces from Aero in Windows 8 (ahem, Aero Glass), but I gotten used to that and it doesn't bother me too much now. Having the ability to snap apps on the side of the screen is pretty nifty. Say that you're typing up something in Microsoft Word, you can have, say the Music app, on one side of the screen and be able to control what song you're listening to and all of that. Windows Store is already getting an abundance of apps being made for Windows 8, which is good, and hopefully spur more development from others to create something for Windows.

Overall, I actually like Windows 8. The OS is completely different, but it is rock-solid stable, and a fun OS to play with. Also, since the days of Windows 95, the Windows OS has looked almost the same in terms of construction, and Windows 8 pretty much gave Windows a new coat of paint. the UI looks better than it has in years, and I applaud Microsoft for that, but I do ask why they removed certain elements of Aero. I've used Windows since 98, and for being part of a generation that now are using Android, iOS, etc., I felt that Windows 8 was a little off, but this is why Microsoft did what they did with this OS - the way computing is done is changing. More people are buying tablets and smartphones and using them more than PCs. Microsoft needed to make something like this to keep up with the jonses. Sure you can say that Microsoft is copying Apple, but this hasn't been the first time they did that. Plus, I'd like Microsoft to succeed in the tablet computing space, and Windows 8 is the key. Is this OS good? No. I think Microsoft could've done better, but is it stable? Hell yes. I'd say that Windows 8 is just about as stable as Windows 7 if not better. Could this OS succeed? Probably, given time, but this is my own opinion. All I can say is, despite the controversy surrounding this OS and the radical changes done on this OS, I actually like Windows 8, and this OS is a winner in my book. If it weren't for the rough upgrade process, I would've given this 5 stars."
Very good it work with my printer
"Please do not buy this product. While it was a solid performer before, the company has now discontinued all the 'Plus' products and is not supporting them further."
"I have been using the hard cover Life Application Study Bible for many years and love it.  I was sceptical about the Kindle version but it has surpassed my expectations!  Navigation is much easier than I thought it would be.  It's very easy to switch back and forth between the Commentary study notes and the text.  And the Table of Contents makes finding chapters very quick and easy.  I have had other electronic versions of the Bible that were hard to navigate, so it was great that this one works so well.  Definitely worth the price!"
These certificates were an office hit. They are really funny and you can modify each to fit exactly what you want or the person.
"While I held out high hopes that iBank would help me get rid of my need for VMWare to run a decent version of Quicken that handles all financial needs. During the Beta of iBank 5 I was very happy with the product. I was able to export my Windows Quicken data and import the QIF file into iBank5 Beta. during the beta I had tested functions and the data became unusable, so when I purchased iBank 5 I removed the Beta version and tried to import the same QIF I used in the Beta. This did not work. I was unable to choose the QIF file from the directory and I was also not able to drag the QIF file into iBank. I contacted support who sent me a link on how to import my file, which is what I had done initially. I explained that and was told to contact their online support which is only available Monday - Friday 9-5 Eastern. I explained I had a job and would not be able to have my system and be online during their short support window. I received other responses from IGG software on how to import ibank4 to ibank 5, how to sink iPad to ibank 5, none of which I asked. outside to their support path I tried their knowledge base and over a weeks period I had received no responses. I downloaded their recent update 5.01 hoping this would correct the QIF import issue, but it did not.

I have also tried adding an account manually and tried updating it with the QIF downloaded from the financial institution. That yielded a pop-up with a blank box with a Cancel and Back button only. Clicking either did not import my data.

I am waiting on IGG Software to refund my purchase price as for me this product does not work."

"Running a top of the line Dell XPS.  Loaded Roxio Easy Media Creator 8.0 and got infamous ""Blue Screen of Death"".  Removed software and computer operation was normal.  Same results on subsequent attempts to load software.  Tried to use ROXIO web-site for help with absolutely no success.  Disscussion group tried hard to help, but suggestions were not helpful.  There seems to be no way to contact ROXIO live assistance.  Automated tech assistance (Roxanne) is useless. I do not plan to try instalation again.  Just not worth the trouble.  Would donate software to good cause, but would feel guilty about giving an innocent receiver such a troublesome software product.  Probably will just throw the $80 software away."
Not impressed at all.
"One thing I noticed is that when you already have Norton 360 and use express renewal on the Norton 360 screen, is that when you click on ""I have product key or code"", which you do have with this new purchase, and then go thru the ""renewal"", you lose what remaining days you had on the old ""subscription.  Not a big deal if you wait until the day the old subscription runs out.  And if you have an existing account, you get a screen after renewal to sign in/create account, you can use your old account Email/password.

Pretty simple when using ""account"" >> ""renew subscription"" on your 360 page.  And as many have said, much cheaper then buy thru Norton."
"I don't really like spending the money so often, but the database seems to be the main weakness in my Nuvi.  Even with the new database, a customer address for my next business trip is unknown (street is not in the database)."

Sent back ..would not download  :(
"I'm actually really disappointed with this product. It does a few things really well, but there's a huge gaping hole where sales transaction importing should exist... There is no option at all to import CSV or similar documents that contain sales transactions. You're forced to use a half-baked add-on from a third party. I checked out most of them, and they're all GROSSLY overpriced, eclipsing the cost of this software. For a feature that I expected to be built-in, based on the description, that's very disappointing. I'm now trying to figure out how to get my money back for a piece of software on which I wasted an entire weekend setting up. I spent a lot of time reading about solutions for our small business, and I feel duped here..."

This product is great if you know how to use it. I have an earlier version and I couldn't tell much of a difference. Thought I would be getting night and day but this didn't meet expectations. Don't get me wrong this is a great product but compared to the earlier versions I noticed this didn't have nearly as many picture frames to work with. Plus editing text is a pain in the a double s. I had to youtube numerous videos just to figure this out. Not happy about that. Overall I would still buy this product again because the price was definitely worth it.
Nice app makes reading very easy
"The post by GRB (washington, dc) sounds very much the same way I felt when I first installed my BioTutor. However, I did not purchase my BioTutor from amazon. I can not defend GRB that the individuals that rated 5 stars are bogus, but I have to agree with GRB this application software does lack greatly. My son looked at it once and that was it. He uses another biology software, which include videos, graphs, excellent 3D pictures and so on.

PS- Too bad there is no such thing as a ""no"" no star in this place.

I have to admit to have something like BioTutor on the market today reminds me of my days when I worked at a company that used command line operating system.....It's like a DOS application. (You know those screen that have blue background and white text).

I think the intention behind this program was quick profit...the only thing that is of quality is the box that it comes in. I can not speak the same of their ChemistryTutor, but if GRB states that it has a similar interface than I would not recommened that one either. Buttom Line: Do not purchase this product unless you want to verfiy that what I have stated is correct."
"Quicken 2013 is a disaster... Ended up with corrupted file due to quality of Q13 conversion process during installation.  Lost all the confidence (and basically 14 years of data) after being loyal Quicken user for 14 years. Sad story...

"Good for those looking for a vector collection.  Not so good for those looking for photo clip art, as photos are ""high-res"" at 200 DPI.  I suppose the photos are useful to an extent, but the usefulness is limited by size.  I was looking for vector art, so I am satisfied."
Worksas expected.
"I had McAfee before trying Trend Micro, and I found Trend Micro kept my systems (a laptop running Windows XP Pro and a virtual desktop running Vista Ultimate) performing faster.  The user interface was clear and easy to use. Not having viruses, and not being willing to look for some, I can't say how well it handles them, but I assume it does at least a fair job."
"VirusBarrier X6 is an ultimately useless product. It found none of the viruses indicated by the FREE Sophos Anti-Virus software, most of which have to be cleaned up manually. Which is why I bought VirusBarrier X6. I didn't want to have to clean these malware issues on my own. Not only that, but VirusBarrier X6 has bogged down my system (a 24-inch iMac) to a crawl, with startups taking well over a minute. Don't waste your money. Use Sophos and go through the manual process to clean up viruses. I wish I could sent this back with an immediate refund. Alas, I'm stuck with a CD and some software that I wouldn't pass on to anyone."
"So now I get a email offering me $25 Amazon credit if I subscribe to CC, and $25 off the Photoshop/Lightroom package - also on the CC.  NO.  I will not pander to their greed and will never buy their products again.

Then I see that the offer is only open to those living in the US.  As I live in the UK I couldn't take advantage of this measly bribe - sorry 'offer' even if I wanted to.

BTW - In the UK, the version with the blue 'PS' on the box costs 205.78 per year (around $329.24), and there is another version in a different box which costs 548.78 for year - that's about $878.  PER YEAR.  The specs appear to be the same, so not sure what's going on.  Also 'only available to those living in the UK'  like anybody else would want to pay that price.  Not that I care as I wouldn't touch it with a barge pole."
"Older Ghost very functional on older WinXP PCs, I didn't use the older Norton antivirus 2008 program because it's obsolete."
"I have been using an assortment of Norton & Symantec products for years and while I have had some issues with them at times, overall I prefer their software over all others.  There is a reason Norton (aka Symantec) is the industry leader - they are more consistent, more robust, and more stable than most other products on the market today.

That being said, I would not recommend this specific product for the average user. It provides antivirus only and no additional protecion, e.g. firewall, etc.  I recommend Norton 360 instead, as it covers all aspects of security for an individual home-based computer possible for a piece of software.

I do like how Symantec has started providing multiple licenses (sometimes for devices, sometimes for users) to help lower the overall total cost of ownership.

If you already have a firewall (software or hardware based) and are precautious with the sites you browse, etc. then the antivirus functionality of this product will work great for you. I have a 2 layer firewall system in my house and security software on a server which protects my network from most malicious sites.  As such, I only want to run a single-purpose program for my antivirus and this product fits the bill perfectly."

"Im not sure where I would be with our physics tutor, I am a senior in high school and was practically failing physics and needed help!!! and I found it in the form of a software. With out this program I doubt that I would have been able to learn anything let alone pass the course. I am just thankful that I found this program in time to get my grade up."
"All forms are back as they were for 2013 - if Intuit hadn't restored this capability to TurboTax Deluxe, I would have abandoned TurboTax and switched to a competitive product.  I was angry in 2014 when forced to upgrade to TurboTax Premier, but calmed down when Intuit realized their mistake and offered the $25 rebate.  I respect that Intuit acknowledged their screw up last year and made things right through both the 2014 Rebate and restoration of capability for 2015."
"I had a computer problem and when I went to Intuit to get a new starter edition 2013 did not have. Plus, the 2014 edition did not read or transfer the older ones per there web site. This was a great saver of a frustrated person."
"I shopped around and no one could come close to this price. I have used HR Block several years in a row now. I previously used TurboTax, but it is much more expensive. Very little difference in those two products - except price."

"Not sure what the problem is but having had poser in the past ( as a reseller ) I can say that install problems have not been uncommon for Poser products.  In this case the Libraries that include all the figures ( kinda necessary, right? ) simply don't work.

While waiting on a reply from Smith Micro I have tried all of their published ""solutions"" to this problem but none of them work.  Not sure an upgrade will fix the problem because several forums indicate that even the top of the line version has problems with the library not loading.

A wiser publisher would not tie themselves to the whims of Adobe to make their product function.

Since update to Win 10 this will not even load. Crashes on start.

If you can install and it works...be thankful.  But I suspect that these are common problems that Smith Micro has never really resolved in any of their releases.

Just make sure a refund is possible then consider Blender and MakeHuman which are totally free, more powerful...but much harder to learn.

--

UPDATE

Smith Micro sent me a link to download the newer version. Problem is it is a ""download manager"" and not the actual program. All that wants to do is keep installing the same download manager and never downloads the actual program.  I have asked for a direct link to the actual program files or an ISO.  If they cannot fix their own program I cannot see upgrading to a more expensive problem.  Poser has been less than stellar since it was purchased by Smith Micro."
Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So Im short about 19 0r so words for your review.
"I have been running Star Office 6.0 since the beta program began, and I love this software.  I found the word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation package to be so compelling, I uninstalled Microsoft's product.  In other words, Sun has a Microsoft killer on it's hands.
There are a handful of MS-Office features that Star Office lacks (most importantly: the ability to handle embedded OLE objects such as VISIO).  But there is also a bundle of nice touches that StarOffice adds that do MS one better.  The user interface is fast, slick, and powerful.  After using it for a few months, I found the UI to be preferable it to MS Office -- though this is a matter of personal taste.
I have found Star Office to be fast, reliable, and compatible.  I love the fact that I can start a document at work, on UNIX, and finish it up at home on Windows, without a hiccup.  StarOffice is so cheap, IT managers ought to be fired if they don't at least consider StarOffice for their corporate desktops.  The licensing policy that allows a single user to run StarOffice on a variety of machines (home, work, and laptop, anyone?) is like a breath of fresh air compared to Microsoft's End User Agreement.
I haven't played much with the integrated database, or with the photo editting application that was not part of the beta program.  I do like the integrating drawing package, which I now use instead of VISIO for all of my diagramming.
It will take more than just excellent software for StarOffice to steal market segment away from MS -- but it's at least nice to know that Sun got the ""excellent software"" part of the equation right this time."
"Now that I have everything set up and am using QB regularly, I really like it. It is an integrated system, not just a glorified checkbook register. Estimates, invoices, purchase orders, client contact info, A/P, A/R, etc.--they're all interlinked, and QB comes loaded with all the reports, forms, etc. that I need to see my business's status from any perspective at any time, almost instantly. Customizing the forms to fit my needs was not difficult. And you have options for turning on or off automatic help features to fit your level of accounting knowledge, so you're not interrupted by ""help"" if you don't need it. My existing Quicken files were converted and integrated into the new QB setup flawlessly, so there was no time spent on repeat data entry, either.

But I have to say, getting to this point was a bit of a trial.

First, the installation instructions are at times misleading. The most extreme example is this, from the FAQs: ""To use QuickBooks, you must have Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 installed. If you do not have any version of Microsoft Internet Explorer on you system, you can download...."" I was irritated to read this because the system and software requirements list provided before you buy does NOT mention IE. I am a Firefox convert and removed IE long ago but decided to attempt installation anyway. Turns out QB works just fine without IE. I can't fathom why that is in the FAQs.

Second, it takes a while before you're just allowed to use the software unaccosted. The first bunch of times QB is opened, it pops up a sales window for other related products. And you're not given the choice to opt out of email marketing until *after* you've received the first few emails. Thankfully, the up-sell appears to be a temporary annoyance. I haven't seen one of those ad windows for a while now, and ""unsubscribe"" was effective. QB also pressures you repeatedly in the beginning to join the online user forum. While it's great to know the forum is there if I should run into trouble, the vast majority of the time I don't want to be invited to hang around a forum just because I have a transaction to record. Thankfully again, those repeated invitations also ceased after maybe half a dozen times opening QB.

Long story short: now that I'm past the built-in annoyances, I'm very happy with this software."
"Just like promised delivery was fast and on the day promised, install was quick and easy and took me less than 30 minutes to get it up and running. I recommend Pokki for a good start menu not entirely in love with the new version on that sense. I agree with Onuora from Windows news about the start menu in his letter to the new windows 8 chief Julie Larson-Green"
Great deal
"This is my first time using the Turbo Tax line of tax preparation software in over a decade.  I have been a loyal H&R Block software user for many years.  I thought I would give Turbo Tax a try after being away from it for a number of years.

There is nothing really extra ordinary in the taxes I prepare.  My taxes mainly consist of work income, interest, dividend, and investment sales.  I have a mortgage and pay property taxes on several parcels of land.  I have a relative that lives in Alaska that I help with their taxes, so I do deal with the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend payout and retirement income there.

Loading the software onto a PC was quite easy, though it did seem to take a bit of time to load.  I imported my H&R Block tax return into Turbo Tax without any issues at all.

Updating last years information and entering new information into Turbo Tax was easy and for the most part uneventful. The only thing I really did not like with the Turbo Tax software was that it was not obvious where to enter the Alaskan Permanent Fund Dividend information for federal taxes where in the H&R Block software it was much more obvious.

Comparing my experiences between H&R Block and Turbo Tax, I found both programs to be very similar and both to be very easy to use.  Personally, if I have to choose between the two, it would 100% come down to price.  For the 2014 software, I would need Turbo Tax Premium to deal with investment income or H&R Block Deluxe.  At the time of this review, H&R Block Deluxe is about half the price of Turbo Tax Premium.  While the Turbo Tax software does the job just fine, it really seems to be a poor value for the money.  H&R Block Deluxe is a very similar product, does just as good of a job, and the cost is half as much.

Unless you have a strong attachment to Turbo Tax for some reason, I would recommend passing on this product and picking up H&R Block software."
"I have been wonderfully supprised at how Eset Smart Security V.4.0 program works. I am hoping that it will continue to function like it has worked so far. I now have piece of mind that I will be much better protected from so many viruses, etx. I highly recommend this product to everyone wanting this security. The computer store that had to reformat my hard drive due to many viruses said that they use this particular program thenselves and recommend it to businesses."
McAfee does the job. Had problems getting the product working had to call support. As long as it keeps my computer virus free it's worth the money.
Works great
I always use Norton and like it
This is a handy dandy software package and is a real time save when we need to have long legal descriptions for property prepared for cases. We scan a copy of description into a PDF and then have that loaded into a Microsoft Word document for correcting as needed. The conversion will never be perfect but the results are a lot better than typing legal descriptions from scratch.
"Allot of recipes to try here. Those I've tried, a great convenience for cooking."

I love amazon music. Not a fan of streaming music so I like the fact that I can buy and own my music through Amazon. Downloading to iTunes and putting music on my prehistoric iPod is truly great. Thank you Amazon for keeping me in music.
I've never tried Webroot before so I thought I'd give it a go. I've had it for a little over 1 month now and I can say that I'm happy with it. It's not as obtrusive as I've found other antivirus softwares to be. The scans are quicker. It works silently in the background and notifications only pops-up occasionally. And I can use it on my android phone which is a nice plus.
"Have this installed on a small HTPC machine running an i3 processor. W8 runs better on this processor than W7 on an older laptop. You have to adapt to the new interface but it's definitely growing on me. If yuo can't deal with the new start screen, then just go directly to the deasktop and you have basically the same experience as W7. Don't be afraid, everything seem to run faster and no crashes"
"I always used Microsoft Money but after buying and using this product, I am glad I switched. I love the easy to use interface and the easy account setup."
Item was not as advertised.  It was not able to record from Xbox.  Item no. in box was not same as stated on the box. I have lost well over $100 having to return the items & not getting a refund of the postage I had paid

"Missing Sync is touted as being a better replacement to HotSync.  Trust me it isn't.  I wish the company had offered a trial before you buy as many compnies do.  Now I know why.  I was syncing successfully before I installed this program.  Now my information will not sync with either Personal Organizer or Entourage, two programs they state they support.  After several uninstalls and reinstalls, I have decided to uninstall and not purchase anymore software without a try before you buy."
"I will hear someone on a tech show talk about how wonderful Numbers is, or how valuable Pages is, and I will instantly forget I already bought it once and never used it, and resold it, and I'll have hope in my heart a newer version is different and all I've heard is true, and it will change my life. So I buy it again, and I never use it."
"This was easy to download and install, I was using MSOffice Professional about an hour after I received the key card.

The download was easy, installation was rather simple, though it does take some time.  I have had similar MS items which required being reinstalled on a new computer, this does require a phone call and explanation that the previous computer is no longer operational and then they will allow it to be reinstalled.  If you just try to install it again without calling their support line, it will not allow you to reinstall the software."
"I've reached the point where I wish I didn't make this purchase. It tooks days just for the Intuit site to be working properly so that I could verify my product and license codes. Now I can't even log in. I've set and re-set my email and password on the site to no avail. So now, I guess what's another 24 hours till they respond to me?"
"I had used Corel Paint for years, so when this paint shop prox5 came out I had to try it!
Blown away, I love the ease of use and the backgrounds (as extras) are all ROYALTY FREE...BONUS!
The only problem I had was because my xp was older, and I am a bit lax with updates, I had to update my service packs for it to work. SO, make sure you have the most current service packs if you have an old computer and MAKE SURE YOU HAVE at LEAST 4GB available for this program, it is a program HOG but is well worth it!
YAY corel, I love you."

"With all the commercials and buzz you would think this would be a wonderful product but alas after 6+ hours of repeating Lessons 1 and 2 over and over again I don't think I've learned much other than the words for boy and girl. Learning like a child? Immersion? I suppose that would work if I was a child. As the lessons progress, they introduce too many variables all at once...new objects combined with concepts like masculine and feminine along with singular versus plural. If you want someone to learn the word for boy, show a picture of a boy. Then, show a picture of two boys with the plural for boys. Etc. Don't jump from one boy, to a girl giving a boy a pen. What? Rosetta Stone's learning methodology seems to involve a great deal of randomness with no context to what you are seeing and multiple variables at a time. I have *never* been so frustrated trying to learn something as with this product. I could see *some* value if you already knew some basics, and needed practice or wanted to polish pronunciation. As a rank beginner though, find another product. You will find nothing here but weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Watch out!  My experience with this product was filled with issues after attempting to repartition my hard drive.  Acronis support tried to assist me without success.
"Overall, Turbotax Premier is still a very useful program, but it has lost some of its luster. On the plus side, it has the following going for it:

-It is still easy to use and simplifies your taxes.  Turbotax Premier guides you through even complex returns, including joint returns with multiple Schedule Cs.

-It now includes ItsDeductible, which sold separately last year,  for free. This nifty little program stores all of your charitable donation information and provides valuations for your non-cash donations. It will save you a bundle if you donate clothing.

-Although somewhat hidden, (why, I don't know) ItsDeductible now gives you the option of storing your 2006 charitable donations online on its web site throughout the year for free. Presumably, when you get around to doing you '06 taxes you will then automatically download this info into you ItsDeductible 2006 program.

-It includes a free state download. Last year you had to buy the state program separately and send in a refund coupon. Intuit has (thankfully) decided to just go ahead and bundle the state program.

-The 2005 version is better at deciding which sections to skip. Previous versions were not very good at deciding what to skip and what to go over, in my experience.

On the downside, this year's Turbotax Premier has several drawbacks that make is somewhat less user-friendly than last year's version:

-Navigation, as other reviewers have noted, is too linear and makes the program a drag to use if you need to update specific items. ***There is a work-around, however.*** Go to the ""Tools"" menu and select ""See Topic List."" You will then see the old navigation window from last year, which allows you to jump to specific areas of your return.  Why Intuit hid this feature away, I don't know.

-The one-click updates feature is buggy. I had problems with it on two computers.  On one of them, it would hang after downloading 12% of ANY update, including the free state product. I had to disable Zone Alarm, NAV, and the Windows firewall, then click over to a part of the return that would trigger a download to get it to work (even then, it wouldn't work by selecting the menu item directly).

-The IRA section doesn't tell you up front if you are eligible for a Roth or traditional IRA. It first asks you if you have made or plan to make any IRA contributions, and only later in the filing process does it tell you that (surprise!) you can't make contributions to an IRA. You then have to manually go back and erase your IRA contributions (if you haven't already made them, that is!) to set things right. This is poor planning on Intuit's part. The program should first crunch the numbers to see if you are eligible, and only then ask if you want to fund an IRA.

-There is no coupon for one free federal e-filing. The price has not gone up, but you won't get it for free. TaxCut still has free e-filing, by the way.

Out of morbid curiosity (or a love of pain, I don't know) I also used a free version of TaxCut basic to prepare the same return (a relatively ""simple"" full 1040 with itemized deductions). While it's not fair to compare the basic version of TaxCut to the high-end, expensive Turbotax Premier, I do think that Turbotax is still somewhat easier to use and uses more approachable language to explain tax issues.  In addition, Turbotax has a much wider selection of downloadable 1099s and W-2s than TaxCut.

I know some reviewers have experienced calculation errors with Turbotax. All I can say is that both Turbotax and TaxCut gave the exact same results for the return I prepared.

As for the state version, I used Turbotax to prepare my VA return but then used Virginia's very good (and free) Web filing site to submit my return. Both Turbotax and the Virginia e-filing site churned out very similar figures. The differences between the two resulted from Turbotax's rounding off all numbers to the nearest dollar, while Virginia's site kept track of every penny. If you want to save yourself the state e-filing fee, you may want to check with your state tax agency to see if it offers free e-filing on its own. It's a bit more work, but you can use the state return prepared by Turbotax as a cheat sheet."
Liked it when I bought it several years ago.
Love the updated version.
"My quad 64 got turned into a 32 bit by the free upgrade, which I had no warning it was going to do.  I had hopes this would fix it but the disk had a corrupt .dll file and would not boot so I returned it.  if I had a prayer of winning I'd sue to replace my computer. the only thing worse would be a mac."
"This was surprisingly easy to put on my Garmin Nuvi. And it really does sound like Yoda giving you directions. My only minor gripe is that the phrases that Yoda says get a little repetitive after a couple months or one really long car ride. I let my friend use my GPS for trip and the voice got on his nerves, but I still love it. Also, Yoda (obviously) doesn't pronounce names of roads or anything like that. He just tells you when to turn and stuff."
"This is the first time I have prepared my own income tax.  After paying, what was becoming excessive preparer's fees every year, I decided to take a chance on my own.

The directions on the product were clear, concise, and I was pleased with the professional looking hardcopies.  If this goes well and a problem doesn't arise with IRS, I'll certainly continue preparing taxes on my own."
Still the best for the do it yourself preparer. Carries data forward from year to year. Usually helpful. Recommend not using password protect. No way to access data or carry forwards if user forgets or problem arises.
When I needed to amend my taxes the program was difficult to work and gave me different results that i couldn't submit.
"great product, fast delivery. Exactly what was expected and advertised for a common software product. It actually contained a few more features than expected, although I will likely not use the extras."
"For years I have been addicted to the Mac Computer in its various forms.  Apple Works, Microsoft Works was my choice of word processors.  Then I tried Microsoft Word beginning with 1998.  When Microsoft Word 2004 came out, I considered upgrading.  Finally with MacBook Pro, I took the refreshing plunge! What a joy to click on the blue M and know I will have a document that IS quickly and easily professional and accurate.  Communication has never been easier!"
"Use has always been easy, informative, secure, and above all accurate.  Catches the little errors and ensures that you get them corrected."
"Works great and love the Deduction Pro module. However, they incorporated it into the program which is not a great as when it was separate program. Before I could use it throughout the year when making donations of clothing and items to charitable organization and provide a list of items with donation value. This way the organization sign and dated the itemized list with the value of the donation so I can retain this copy with my filed taxes.

Also more detail and helpful information around 529 programs was very lacking. I had to dig through many tax publications before I could find the answer I needed to just enter a value during the interview process. Come on H&R Block, many states have 529s, this section needs to improve.."
Use this all time when I am in gym working out. Great choice to listen to
Turbotax did not meet expectations. Difficult to return to sections.  No help evident for pay back to social security. Had to engage accountant. Hope with his help to amend previous returns.
"It secured my computer, woohoo!"
Much less intrusive than most antivirus.
"New version did not meet my expectation for upgrade!  For example very difficult to find a simple command ""Reconcile.""  Hidden!  Not like Version 2007 to reconcile you must take several steps to do and then I found there was no way found to command and produce a reconcile report."
"Very accurate even while not pronouncing precisely, contains additional tools to edit while dictating."
"If you have used any of the previous PrintShop or PrintMaster products, you will be disappointed in this product!  I can't even believe that they think this product is acceptable to sell.  It is crap!  And customer service is non-existent.  I am outside of the 30 day guarantee so I am out $90.  I have a worthless product that I can't even use.  Please, listen to the reviews, Do Not Purchase This Product!"
"After reading a lot of comments, pros and cons, I decided to give it a try. It did not work very well at first and then I downloaded all of the latest drivers for my MB and then it worked very well!! A good product for the money. I have used it quite extensively since installing it. Highly recommended!!"
My grandchildren love this software. It is challenging enough to keep them interested and easy to navigate. Keeps them busy on a rainy day.
"This Norton Security package is simply the key code card one can use to pay for the download of the security software from Symantec.  Although I think Symantec overcharges for their security software upgrades in general, this key code was competitively priced (at Amazon) and does protect up to 5 devices including desktops, laptops, tablets, etc.  It arrived promptly, undamaged and was as advertised.  Applying it to one's devices could prove a little tricky depending on whether you already have Norton software on your system and whether or not you already have an on-line account with Symantec.  Space does not permit a more detailed explanation but most people can work through the problems if they have a little experience with downloading software.  One difficulty I encountered was that the 33 days I had remaining on my installed old Norton Internet Security software was not automatically added to the new Norton Security software when it was downloaded and installed.  I used a chat room call to Symantec and got this properly added to my new Norton Security software.  Good luck!"
"My computer came with Nortons when it was new.  It worked fine for about a month, then it started to tell me it was expired.  Every time I try to open a Word or Excel doc, I get an error message from Nortons ""does not support the repair feature""?  When I start up it literally takes over 10 minutes to load.  The disk never stops running.  The internet is almost as slow as dial up was.  Nortons wants $40 a year to keep up to date and if you don't pay then it will start to cause all kinds of problems including connecting to liveupdate every day (slow) and popping up while you are trying to do other things on the internet.  I am not a big computer person, but all the computer geeks at work say to get rid of it and use one of the freeware antivirus like avast. Guess what, Norton's is very hard to get rid of they tell me.  Do yourself a favor when you buy a new computer pay someone to set it up right.  All the junk and trial stuff on there will destroy your computer within a few months if it is not removed properly before you start using it."
"It was easy to setup and it works great. Had some issues getting my Retina display and Windows Graphics to play fairly with each other, but not a big deal."
"WORST customer service experience I have ever had in my life. Not only did installation of their supposed upgrade (to NSW 2005 from 2004) severely damage my operating system (MS-xp_pro), but Norton refused responsibility and tried to palm me off on Microsoft Fee-Based Tech Support. After countless hours on the phone with Microsoft, we identified the problem squarely at Norton. I then had to fight for 3 days with Norton Fee-based Customer Service even to get a troubleshooter on the phone, who then led me through a wild goose chase of useless fixes. (This after being lied to for three days about the reasons for the delays -- that they were supposedly researching my issue.) If you already made the mistake of dealing with this despicable company, demand your money back!"
"This product does the trick for us; my husband is self-employed and I am a teacher. It takes us through all of the steps for deductions. I used the free State file for us as well, but found that our state also has a free state filing system this year, which I used for my son, since his taxes were not complicated."
So glad I didn't read any reviews before buying this product.  Within 5 minutes of installing the program onto my computer I was copying my first video onto a DVD.  Amazingly simple and quality of DVD was outstanding.  LOVE THIS!!!!
I like this but it does have problems.... cant save more than 3 files at once and can never remember to register it.
It makes different reports in different formats that are really useful.  It was very user friendly.
I rarely write review. I am computer engineer. My computer first got hack by using this product. I replaced Norton and save the PC. I try cancel the subscription and it is so difficult to cancel.
should be upgrade to play better at newer windows versions.
"I had trouble with older DVD players not recognizing ""chapters"". I just pull each chapter video into their software and when it is exported, it works!!"
Worked as it should allowing transfer of older formats to load into the computer and transfer to later media
"Santa Claus brought this at Christmas time and it is a lot of fun and very educational, particularly for someone who's learning the basics of reading and math.  It's a little challenging if your little one does not yet recognize all the letters, which is good."
Lots of fun stuff to do
"Have used it fro years. Just wish that Turbo Tax would develop MAC based tax software for business returns - 1102, 1065, etc."
i like it
"Kaspersky is the best Internet Security for the money.
Easy for the consumer to use, doesn't get in the way of the computer and does the job.
For the past four years it has blown away the competition!"
"I bought the original version of this product (Picture Rescue) a few years ago (and it worked great).... I hadn't needed until a few days ago when my computer corrupted some images and I had already erased them from this memory card. So my husband reminded me that we had this old program and it might work. Well it did but it would shut down in the middle of recovery (This program was intended for OS 10.3 or 4, and I am on 10.6). So I emailed the folks @ Prosoft and explained my issue. They said, ""Just download Klix, your old serial number will work."" Yay, luckily I contacted them before shelling out more money for a new program (which I would not have at the moment). Recovered the lost images.

Thanks Prosoft!"
I love it! Its small enough to bring with me when I travel but still has lots of memory and good screen clarity and the convienience of touch screen .
having the ability to access my data anywhere from any device makes all the difference.
Didn't work.
"Buyer beware.  I tried to convert from quicken for windows (2013 edition).  very non-intuitive overly complex process.  Have to download a separate converter, etc.  It's pretty pathetic that intuit can't make a more user friendly process to move data from the PC to the mac version of it's own software.

Once moved 2/3 of my bank accounts could not connect.  Hours of time with chat support and many ""Workarounds"" later the banks connected without error.  Next day noticed although no connection errors, no transactions were being downloaded, although there were new posted transactions when I checked my bank online.  Looks like it doesn't have the capability to auto reconcile when you download transactions similar to the windows version.  To reconcile you have to have a start date, end date, start balance, end balance and then select transactions etc.  In the windows version it did this automatically every time you downloaded transactions.  You matched your transactions and it reconciled to the online balance.

I am searching vigorously for a replacement for quicken (continue to use windows version until then).  My needs are simple,  enter transactions manually, download transactions from bank to match to what I've entered, reconcile with online balance.  That's it.  Hard to find anything else that really does that.  I guess that is why intuit can release such garbage without fear of going out of business."
"If I could have given it 0 stars I would.  I have a virus on my computer that deletes my printer files - NAV didn't even pick it up.  When I contacted customer service I got the run around - these guys were telling me stuff I had already thought of.  After paying an additional 39.95 for service, and wasting 1 1/2 days of my life I got nothing.  I ended up having to re-install windows and they won't refund my money.  All I ended up doing was chatting with a bunch of what I guess by their names to be Indians.  They kept wanting me to spend more money to upgrade my service to their premium level.  What a joke."
"I'm torn as to whether to give AIDA 64 Extreme 3 or 4 stars.  Ultimately, based on my intended use and the software's functionality, I go with 3 stars.  Whether I would recommend you purchase this product depends on your desired uses.  I purchased AIDA 64 with the intent to monitor various aspects of my computer (temps, clock speeds, fan speeds, etc.).  I particularly wanted something that had on OSD (on screen display) option.

Pros:
- Copious info on your computer from temps (CPU, CPU package, individual CPU cores, motherboard, GPU, etc.) to memory usage.  If there's info that you want on your computer, you can probably find and/or monitor it with AIDA 64 extreme.
- Fairly good user interface, with one exception (in my opinion).

Cons:
- The OSD cannot be displayed in-game, severely limiting it's usefulness to check temps, etc. when you're gaming.
- The software's use of the sensors conflicts with my Asus software's use of the sensors.  This led to erroneous readings in my Asus software, including an erroneous voltage reading that led to a hard shutdown of my computer due to the Asus anti-surge protection.  I would just get rid of the Asus software, but I use it to control my fans.  AIDA64 doesn't control fans.
- The OSD and desktop displays are buried under ""file"" --> ""preferences"".  It's odd that they don't get their own drop-down in the main screen like the benchmarking tools do.

The first 2 cons listed seriously limit the usefulness of this software for me. I'll still get some use out of the great depth of info it provides and perhaps will try out the benchmarking/stress test tools.  This software might be more useful for others, such as if they want to use it mostly for the benchmarking tools included (which I haven't explored yet since that wasn't my main focus in purchasing this software), aren't using other software that reads the same sensors, and/or don't care about in-game OSD."
"Hi, I'm the Gingerbread Man, I gave Avast Antivirus protection a 5 star rating.

The Avast antivirus application informs me daily of upgrades to protect against the ever expanding viral threats that our PCs are exposed to. So I know that this company's layers run deep.  The one time in five years of turning it off and forgetting to turn it back on in a 12 hour period my hard drive became infected and nonresponsive.  I was able to start my PC in safe mode and bring Avast back on line.  I was back up and surfing the internet in no time after that. Now my motto is: ""Don't go On Line Without It.""

There is literally no one I wouldn't recommend Avast Antivirus software to."
It was very helpful
"I installed this product and registered it with no problem.  However, it would not connect to the internet to update the software components, such as antivirus definitions.  I am not a tech wizard, but it seems a poor design to be able to access the internet to register the product, but not be able to do so to update it.  I made two calls to tech support, who took me through numeropus machinations and restarts, which resulted in nothing but a commitment that a higher level tech rep would get back to me.  12 hours later, no one has.  So much for vaunted customer service.  After wasting several hours and $40, I went back to Norton.  Maybe it isn't as sleek as PC-cillin, but it works."
What? Old version? Nobody said anything to me about this being the old version.
"I find the walk-through of all the questions very easy to complete my taxes. The questions aid me in claiming all my deductions.
The section dealing with valuating items donated to charities is invaluable in estimating my charitable donations."
It is by far the easiest way to go and I did not loose any functionality or programs. After install and then running tuneup I got the performance improvement that takes the boring out of web surfing.
"Here's the thing, I still haven't gotten to all the tutorials, and it's just a little overwhelming particularly while I'm up to my ears in novel writing. But the extremely good news is that software is SUPER EASY TO START, and little by little I'm learning different features. And I've promised myself that after the first draft is really, truly done, I'm going to take some time and learn the cool and groovy features.

But just having the simple stuff, such as the binder, the index cards and various labels and categories, along with the very awesome and comes-in-handy search feature has made this process so much better and more fluid than working with a simple word processor. I also just adore the ""compile"" feature, which allows you to export all of your work into a single document and really get a feel for how its looking and flowing.

My one gripe is that they don't yet have an app for mobile devices. If it's out and I just haven't seen it, someone please tell me! But this software really delivers on its promises. Makes the technical parts easy so you can focus on creativity."
"I would not recommend Quickbooks to anyone for several reasons.

I -- On the technical side

1) the Quickbooks 2014 for Mac is often very slow in its process. I had to turn on and off my computer several times, and I just got extra Ram memory on my laptop.
2) There is not a clear explanation on how to download bank transactions, how to add online banking, and then make sure that when the qbo files are downloaded, they will connect to the correct bank. The last time I tried, I had to go into the qbo file and delete the last digit of the account ID, and it was really inconvenient. That whole setup needs more explanation to someone who is non-technical.

II -- On the customer service side, I am extremely dissatisfied with the amount of time it took to resolve my issue (1 hrs and 30 minutes). The representative did not want to help me because I had to PAY to get help. Why would I have to pay when it is YOUR software that is the problem? When I have already paid over $250 for a piece of software, I expect it to work seamlessly without too much issue. I even hired a professional bookkeeper, and both of us could not figure out how to connect the downloaded transaction to the right bank account. It was extremely frustrating. So, the representative simply sent me the online instructions, and I made sure that he was on the phone with me. He was just leaving me, hanging there on phone, without assisting me at all.

You guys just wasted 1 hr and 30 minutes of MY time AND 1 hr of 30 minutes of your company time. This problem could have been explained to me in less than 10 minutes, and that would've been the end of the call. INSTEAD, he had to go FIND the article, email it to me, and wait for me to open it, read it, and process it in my brain.  Then, he was sitting there and waiting for me to figure it out on my own, without doing anything proactive on his part. I am glad that I had some technical background and figured this out quickly. Otherwise, it would've not been resolved.

So, overall, I give the software and the customer very low regard. The representative's name was Bobby. Obviously, I have no idea which country he is from, and I had a very hard time understanding his accent. He even questioned ME by saying, ""Are you on a speaker phone?"" No, I was on the line with my ear right next to the phone, trying my best to listen to what he had to tell me in resolving the problem. At the end, I had to basically read the instructions while I made him stay there.

Very poor level of customer service from Intuit. Even the supervisor had a low level of competency and tried to explain to me that it was not their problem. This was somehow MY problem.  How is it MY problem that your software could not connect the correct qbo files to the right bank account?  Is that how you guys are trying rip extra money off of your customers?  By having a piece of poor quality software so that I have to call and pay EXTRA to get support?"
Easy to use and catches my errors
Loved it thank you !!
"After working on a Dell for so long, I grew accustomed to Windows, but desperately felt the need to take a bite of the ""Apple"" so I upgraded to my wonderful Macbook Pro that I love!  Parallels allowed me to upgrade without losing Windows capability, which was crucial because I didn't want to give that up either since I had been using Windows for my small business.  Now I feel like I have the very best of both worlds! Thanks, Parallels!! You're awesome!"
"I don't have a Kindle yet, so I am happy to have this Kindle for PC so I can read books that I don't have in hard copy."
Good product for constructing/designing flowcharts.  As with all Microsoft programs it could be more user friendly.  Lacks a true password protection for files...anyone can remove the protection.
"I've used TurboTax several times before without any issues, but I had a frustrating problem this time.  I wasn't able to submit my state tax return online.  I didn't find anything applicable in the user community, and I waited on the phone for 45 minutes with no one picking up.  I finally ended up mailing my state return, and I'm hoping that it doesn't go astray to a thief who steals my refund.  I'm very frustrated.  I may give TurboTax one more opportunity to keep my business, but if I have any issues with my 2015 returns, I'll be done with them."
Mr. Jensen provides some important information and tips regarding the operation of the Sony PXW-FS7. Every owner/operator of this camera should have a copy of this guide.
"What can you say about a product that has allways been very easy to use and provides the best
system protection one can find. However, the vendor was a little slow with shipping, it could
have been faster."
OK
"If you're reading these reviews and wondering if you should risk it with this software don't.  While the product itself might be okay if it worked, it doesn't work.  I downloaded it today from amazon, spent 2 hours entering data and setting up accounts and loans and after I closed it it would not open again.  I spent over an hour chatting with someone in India trying to resolve the issue.  (She would take at least 5-10 minutes to respond each time and then kept giving me the same instructions over and over, even when I told her I had already done as instructed).  I finally uninstalled and reinstalled quicken.  It worked once and then the exact same error message, ""Quicken launcher has stopped working.""

Also, though you will never know this before you purchase this unless you read it in a review, downloaded software from amazon is not returnable.  One reviewer said just install Quicken not the updates, but in the downloaded version there is no option not to install updates.

Save your time and your money.  Don't use Quicken, especially don't purchase it from Amazon, where neither Quicken nor Amazon will refund your money."
"My child LOVES this game. He is advanced for his grade in Math and we searched all over for a game to keep him entertained over the summer months. It is a little slow moving (could be our computer), but otherwise, he is working on adding, subtracting, fractions, division, and multiplication."
"This CD-ROM provides an interactive format in which to begin to learn Norwegian with the help of your computer.  The instruction is pitched at the absolute beginners level and covers some basic vocabulary and useful phases.  The instruction typically links a Norwegian word or phrase with its pronounciation in Norwegian and with an English translation.  Pictures and graphics are provided to reinforce the word or phrase.  The various segments of instruction include quizes to test comprehension.  The format is likely to be very user-friendly for children; adults may outrun the instruction fairly quickly.

This product is likely to be most useful for those with no background at all in the Norwegian language."
"If you want to purchase My Memories Suite Scrapbook software and get $10 off AND a $10 coupon for the MyMemories.com store (a $20 value!) just go to [...] and use the code STMMMS26826. This code does not expire so you can use it whenever you want.

When I first recieved the my memories digital scrapbooking software I was excited to use it. However once I started playing around with it, it became a bit confusing. It takes awhile to get used to if you are not familiar with programs like this.
It is easy if you just want to use a premade template and upload your photos, and they do turn out well. However, if you are trying to find/make something specific it can be a bit more challenging. Another downside is that after you buy the kit (a $40 value) if you want more papers/backgrounds you have to buy them. Although (on the plus side) there is a selection of free kits depending if you like that style or not. Personally though, I feel like if you spend that money on a scrapbooking program, it should include everything you need.
What is good about it is that you can make hardbound calanders, photobooks, etc. if you send it out to get printed. I do wish that they would let you just print it out also, but I still haven't been able to figure out how.
Overall, I think it would be a good program for those who are used to digital scrapbooking or who have the patience and time to figure out how to work this."
"I was one of probably millions offended by the apparent greed of Turbotax, a product I had used for about twenty years.  Luckily, I read Amazon reviews before buying TT, then read reviews on H&R Block's software.  Based on those overwhelmingly positive reviews, I decided to make the switch and was very satisfied.  HRB Deluxe was intuitive and easy to use, and I will continue to use it from now on unless they make a TT-like blunder in years to come.  My only complaint is that I could not get it to transfer my data from last year's TT file (I use Windows 7); not a huge deal, just a time-saver."
Easy to use and plenty of options
"Mac's have had bluetooth for ever, yet Dragon for Mac doesn't recognize bluetooth headsets or microphones connected thru the Mac's bluetooth port. It only recognizes headsets and microphones connect via USB. This is according to Nuance's support. If there were 0 stars that is what I would rate the product. I will be looking for an alternate product."
I was disappointed. Quicken works okay... there are still some quirks on automatic account downloads from my bank but I have a work around so I live with that. My main reason for updating was because of the advertised new Mobile / iPad app functionality that I thought would give me a chance to check quickly on all my accounts... but it doesn't do investments -- only bank and credit cards and budgets... So I'm not impressed. The free Mint app from Mint.com (which is also owned by Intuit) has all the similar features... my (grown up) kids think I wasted my money on upgrading to Quicken 13. I should have checked this out further.
"I, also have been a computer user for 30+ years and find this product simply inadequate and unable to deliver.  I wasted an entire holiday weekend trying to create lasting memories for my family.  Instead, I created a lasting memory to never buy Corel products again.  After struggling with ""Trial and Terror"" tactics, and suffering many unexpected aborts and many hours of annoying thumb twiddling, I simply gave up.  My time had value.  It has beeb lost forever and I have zilch to show for it."
"This is my third version of NEW MAC Quicken software. I have been trying to transfer Quicken Windows 2014 over to my MAC since last year. After purchasing the third version MAC 2015 I encountered duplicate transfers when transferring the data files. This version is completely useless if you are trying to move data over from Windows. Do not purchase 2015 as the developers and sales and marketing folks are just trying to cover expenses for a virtual flop. The support staff acts naive and when you point to blogs that reference the problem, the only thing they are good at is a quick refund.
As a result of this fake launch, I am very disappointed in the Intuit instruction of launching this POS without notifying anyone that this problem is prevalent among our community. I would hope Quicken senior leadership carefully looks at who and what stuff is not customer focused and forthcoming about their product. Consider other options IMHO."
the cd i got from this seller didn't work. I emailed him about it and he just gave me a different code for xp.  it didn't resolve my problem at all and now i have to buy another cd.
"I love the Jumpstart games! I agree they are a little pricey, especially if you buy the full subscription up front, but I think if you can afford it, it is a great buy. I bought the whole adventure pack last year for my 3 kids. My 10-year-old is in an MD class and functioning at a kindergarden level, my 8-year-old was repeating kindergarden at the time and my 5-year-old (age 4 then) was advanced and couldn't wait to start school. All three of them enjoy it and my 5-year-old got through the whole 12 adventures by playing while the other two were in school. My 5-year-old is now in kindergarden and is at a first grade reading level and my 8-year-old, now in first grade, is at a second grade reading level. Definitely recommend all jumpstart software."
"Returned unopened after realizing the product was not what I thought it was. My problem was with Amazon, they only returned a small part of the purchase price. Other online retailers return 100% and try to keep their customers."
"It's ok. It burns data disks. But windows burns data disks. It burns images. Just google ""iso recorder powertoy"" and you'll find a great free iso burner (works in 8 great even though it only mentions through windows 7). It lets you copy disks (which you can do with the free iso recorder). It lets you burn music cds--doesn't media player do that as part of windows? So the first half of the program does stuff with disks, but who needs more than free to do this? It does fine doing all these things, but it's not amazing. It's kinda clunky.

Then it lets you edit movies and edit movie dvds. It is easier than Premier Elements, but I prefer Premier still because I have more options. It does this ok, but you can't burn Bluray disks in this version. To be honest, again there isn't much more that this does than the free Windows Movie Maker does... And if you really need more than Movie Maker, you probably need Premier Elements for the real next step up.

And I guess the biggest problem is that the whole program is a relic from the past. I burn probably 10 disks a year. I don't remember the last time I made a music CD. I do make a dvd a year for grandma, but I already have Adobe Premier Elements for that. And most people just upload to youtube! There has to be a smaller and smaller market for this. I mean most ultrabooks don't even come with disk drives! I'm sure there's not enough money to make a better and better program here--just enough money to churn out a new version every year with slight improvements.

And it definitely is a better program than the version I used a few years back and crashed all the time. But now that Creator has arrived to the party in good condition, the party's winding down...

Additional info 1/24/2014: So I needed to burn a .img disk image that I downloaded from the Microsoft Office site. It's a disk download of Microsoft Office for my friend with really slow internet. I've seen .img files before so I know that extension is not unheard of, and I assume that since Microsoft is using it that it's a normal image type. Well, Roxio doesn't recognize it as a disk image format. But the free iso recorder powertoy does. Since Roxio fails me the one time I actually needed it, I'm reducing the rating to one star and uninstalling the software."
"I ordered this product before leaving my country to spent a two weeks vacation in San Antonio, Texas.  Seller assured me that such shipment would be for May 10, 2010 because it was sent via UPS from California.  Tracking this shipment it was in Arizona by May 5....................but now, May 31, hasn't arrived to my brother's apartment, while I'm back in Costa Rica, Central America.  At least, an AMAZON.COM customer service representative sent me an e-mail telling me that payment was reversed so at the end of the month I would find a credit of amount payed. This product came from a third party seller.
All others orders were received on time."
Great Product and good Price. Quick Shipping.
"Norton is the best, no doubt about it.  Google dumps us but Norton makes us strong.  Go Norton !!"
Great product
"This software is so easy to use.  Intuitive, and extensive help will almost make doing your taxes a pleasure.  I have been using this software for years.  You not only get the software, included with the software you also get to file 5 federal returns free of charge.  Using the H & R block software odds the only way to do your taxes, because it is like having a tax expert right in your own home.  You can file electronically or print out your friends and mail them, the option is yours."
Still trying to learn how to use it.
It's OK at best. You learn some stuff but there are FREE phone apps that do a much better job than this.
so good
"My 6 year old daughter really enjoyed playing this game.  It's actually very well made and captivated her attention.  She liked all the ""fun"" activities, decorating her virtual cabin, teaching tricks to her virtual pet cat, planting virtual flowers, sliding down virtual slides, and just walking her character around and looking at the 3D world, as well as the more properly educational activities.  I think it's the right mix of fun and challenges.  The graphics and sound are great too.  My daughter was also quite tickled that the scenery changed depending on the time of the year: halloween, winter, etc...

Where I have a big problem with this company is their marketing strategy.  What you're buying in this package is only a DEMO.  Your child can do the first 2 levels of the game, gets hooked into collecting badges, and then gets a stern message that her parents must go to Jumpstart's website to buy a membership.  It costs $8/month or $75/year.  My big complaint is that nowhere on the box does it say that this product is only a DEMO.  You don't even realize that the software contains only 2 of the 12 levels until your child completes the second level and begs you to buy the rest.  This is deceptive and unethical marketing, and I will not do business with a company that tries to fool people this way.  It's too bad because this would be a great educational tool.  I suppose this is what we get when ""for-profit"" motivations take precedence over ethical, educational and pedagogical considerations.

By the way, the other 3 CDs in the box are just scrap, to make it look like you're buying a lot more than you're really getting."
Excellent
Upgraded from Windows 7 Home and it worked seamlessly.  I really like Windows 7 Professional because you can get additional downloads to run any old XP programs in an XP Mode.
The only improvement I would like to see is more local landmarks on the maps and altitudes appearing on the maps too.
"It's easy for those who are used to the levels of complexity involved with Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to proclaim them to be superior to any and all other similar products. However, for those who are not as tech savvy as your more current webcomic artists, graphic designers, or other aspiring digital artists, there comes another product that is far more approachable than the Adobe line of products, yet still has the potential to equal the power of the likes of Illustrator.

Corel products, in the past, have been very hit or miss. Sometimes you would be landed with a solid piece of software; other times you were left in an anticlimactic state of disdain over what was nothing more than a lackluster piling of clunky and poorly thought out features. X5 has managed to avoid this, focusing on everything from a better system of color management (proper grayscaling is now a possibility) to something that easily rivals a program I've fought with many times in the past; Adobe Bridge.

Indeed, Corel Connect is possibly the best new feature. While it lacks much of the customization that was permitted with coding in Adobe Bridge, Corel Connect has simplified the process. Often, the computer layman would beat on his or her keys in frustration trying to use Bridge, whereas Connect offers much the same end result on a simplified scale, allowing the quick transfer from CorelDraw to Photo-Paint (Corel's PhotoShop equivalent) simply and without extensive knowledge of file formats and coding.

Resizing and reshaping images in previous versions of CorelDraw was never fun, and the constant warping and unwanted glitches that would occur (especially when rounding the corners of rectangles) made the prospect of toying with any images not an option if you wanted to conserve your image. Colors, too, have gained an enormous degree of flexibility; the ability to play with shades and brightness has gone from overly simplistic to being simple to do, but with all the depth you would ever expect out of Illustrator.

The problems converting PNG are also gone and exporting to older formats in CorelDraw is now an actual option. It seems with this iteration, a lot of work was put into something that should be an obvious option.

But just scratching the surface of their big features, CorelDraw has started to catch up with Illustrator; newer brushes, better docking options, photo effects, tool tips that actually make sense, streamlined and logical hot keys, and image sprayer options that are absolutely delightful. CorelDraw is starting to come into its own, and one can only hope that future releases continue to refine a product that has long been sitting on the sideline watching Adobe take all the glory.

If you're looking for something without the learning curve of Illustrator and others, stop at CorelDraw. They might be finally finding their way.

"Not sure why some folks are having problems with restorals in this application.  Maybe it's because I'm a systems manager...maybe not.  I built a brand new tower this summer and loaded it with a Seagate 750GB SATA Drive as the primary OS drive.  The drive failed within 2 months (I should have stayed with Maxtor.)  Although the drive was under warranty and a replacement is on the way, I didn't feel like waiting for the drive to show up.  I got a 300GB Maxtor drive and popped it in.  My image is stored on an external 500GB drive.  Fired up Acronis and went to work.  It prompted me that the drive I wanted to use wasn't the same size and all it asked was if I wanted to use the 300GB drive and how much of it I wanted to use (all of it, of course.)  It asked me if I wanted to verify before restoring the image (I said yes, but be warned it can take 6 hours or more to verify before restoring) and I went to bed.  In the morning, it was all done and I rebooted the PC and all was right with the world.  Lost a couple of files because my last backup was 5 days before, but these things happen.  Say what you will, but Acronis did its job.

My only complaint is that the Try and Decide feature doesn't work with Vista Ultimate 64 Bit.  Acronis tech support said to uninstall/reinstall, but it still freezes up when I activate it.  If anyone knows how to get it working, I'd like to hear about it.  Not having that feature is not a deal breaker.  I wanted backup/recovery/imaging and this does it very well.  As far as I'm concerned, it has already paid for itself.  It has excellent compression and my 500+GB of data across 3 drives imaged at less than 80GB.  Weekly differential backups take up little space as well.

When the new 750GB drive arrives, I'll do a quick image, swap the drive and restore the image back onto the big drive, then repartition the 300GB drive for the kids' PC...they need more storage anyway!  I have no doubts that it will be just as seamless as it was the last time."
"This would probably be a pretty good piece of software if it actually worked.  I installed EMC7 on my new computer, but almost all of the applications (such as DVD builder and VideoWave) fail to even launch.  I've spent many hours with Roxio's (feeble) technical support and on their discussion groups and tried many of their suggested fixes (including their new updates) but nothing helped.  I could understand this software not working on an old computer with inadequate specs, but it should work on a new computer that far exceeds the minimum specs.  This has been a complete waste of time and money.  I think I'll try Nero instead."
"Had it before, and had to update it but still won't work. It freezes my computer and won't play. PITA!"
"Haven't used the editing software, but the device itself works great. Super easy to use."
Easy purchase and excellent value.
have been using the program for several years ~ happy with results
"I like Office 2008 a lot more than Office 2004, which was a crippled software that had remained stagnant in the face of the evolution of it's PC counterpart. I am glad to see the updates made to usability and navigation. Yet, most of its functionality I continue to not need: Entourage still is still horrible when compared to Outlook and, overall, I hope for a decent version of OpenOffice (the current one is less than optimal) to be made available for the Mac platform in the near future.

As for Office, I prefer Keynote hands down over PowerPoint and normally don't need most of the functionality Excel bundles so Numbers tends to do the trick for me. But, as contributor to various web sites, I regularly exchange versions of my articles with editors and need to have access to version tracking, which makes me still go back to Word.

I considered buying a license of Fusion or Parallels to run OpenOffice on the ""PC side,"" but it felt like a convoluted solution to a problem that I still believe will find itself solved completely on the Mac side, either through iWork or OpenOffice. That will certainly be the last time I purchase an Office license."

"Really enjoying my Corel Office products.  Easy to use, compatible with what I need, and offers more than my old product."
"Cheaper way, detailed questions to keep you from missing an item on your return.  Just don't forget to send/mail it!"
"I wasn't good at downloading ...I believe I sent it back
but I here it is a good product to do your taxes"
"I just installed it, easy! I couldn't see paying for Microsoft office when all I use is excell and Word. It is compatible with my files and everything works! Save yourself some money!"
"Kaspersky more than met my expectations, I just wish I had known about it long ago. it is great to now have it in my pc."
I bought this software as a gift for my family member and I really wasn't sure what to expect. I had tried other software titles in the past but this one was definitely worth it. The lessons actually seemed to hold her attention and I did see an improvement. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs some extra help
"I love Norton security
Easy to download and great value for the product"
"I have used Outlook for years, and therin lay the problem. As Operating systems changed, it became harder and harder to install my 2003 version, so I needed a new version that wasn't an online application. This fit the bill perfectly and after installation was able to access my saved emails from a backup. I wish that applications could remain backward compatible and that when MS comes out with new versions that they would allow you to continue installing older versions without limiting the number of times you can install it. I mean what is the big deal if someone installs an outdated version more than three times?"
Avast is still the best but I want to download just Avast and not have to watch out for add on search programs. Otherwise it's well worth it.
"Never, never, never go through Amazon for this.  Go to Adobe and get the subscription directly.  Amazon just cancelled my subscription because, they said, they decided not to support subscriptions with Adobe.  Before that, I spent cumulative tens of hours trying to get my subscriptions untangled.
Adobe was cancelling my software, saying it was about to expire.  Odd.  All my payments to Amazon were on time and current.  I called, and Amazon swore their paperwork was correct, which seemed to give them solace.  Adobe swore they didn't have any record of every being paid, and they were cancelling my subscription.  The conversation with Amazon went like this:

""I don't have my software.""
""But our paperwork is complete.  We've done what we can.  Amazon is done.""
""No, Amazon isn't done, because the deal isn't complete.  I paid you for stuff, but you haven't delivered it.""
""But we did our part.  The rest is Adobe's fault.""
""No, the problem is yours, because you took the money.""
""But our paperwork is complete!""

It didn't get better.

I only got my individual subscription working again through heroic work by the Amazon telephone help guy, but he went way beyond what anyone can expect.  Besides, nobody should have to spend 10 hours on the phone to get a simple subscription working.

And then today, Amazon notified me that my subscription expired.  Today.  The payments were going through, but Amazon decided they weren't taking new orders for subscriptions.  I could keep my subscription through Adobe, although if my subscription was ever cancelled for any reason (they were notifying me that I was being cancelled), Adobe wasn't renewing them.

Have a nice day!

I haven't a clue why Amazon is so miserable at software subscriptions.  They felt that it was my job to work out why Adobe was so unhappy.  The whole ""took money for stuff they didn't deliver"" just left them perplexed.  I went through layers of supervisors and managers, and none of them took responsibility for Amazon's contract with me.

To be fair, I have to no reason to believe that Adobe isn't equally at fault.  But.  The combination of both of them made a confusing business deal impossible.

Run away as quickly as you can.  Really."
"I read the commits over and over again but then I have to update my computer at home to do school work so I brought it and it worked very, very well and very easy. Also in the past Amazon always gave me my money back or credit when I have any problems.... I does work."
"Thank you for this app!!!!!!!!  I have it on both my pc and laptop.....I mainly use them for the exercise, cooking, baking, and diy kindle books!!!!!!  I love it!"
"I can't get this Office program to install.  Once you get through the username and password screens, there is a three-step process:  (1) Click save file.  (2) Click Yes to start installing.  (3) Stay online.

I clicked Save file (step 1).  However, it never gave me a chance to say Yes (step 2), so I was stymied.  Terrible.  $140 down the drain.  Thanks for nothing, Microsoft.

OK.  Let me be fair.  I finally found the Contact Us link.  I tried phone support, but they were closed.  I got chat help.  The tech person got the program installed.  IT TOOK HIM (A PROFESSIONAL IN THIS BUSINESS) 30 MINUTES TO DO THE JOB.  It required his remoting in and taking control of my computer.

This makes Open Office look wonderful by comparison.

Why does Microsoft have to make it so difficult?  I suspect it's because I didn't go their preferred route, which is to rent their software instead of owning it.  Thuggish behavior in my opinion."
I am disappointed because I can not use it. It can not be loaded on Windows XP.
"Worried by all the negative reviews but urged on by the repeated warnings from Quicken that my bank, credit card and investments would not be accessible after April 30, 2010, I waited till the very last minute to do the conversion from Quicken H&B 2007 to Quicken H&B 2010.

On April 30, the last day Quicken 2007 said it would do online updates, I first made sure that all my bills were paid. I did a final update of all my bank, credit card and investment accounts just before midnight on April 30. I then carefully backed up all my Quicken 2007 files to a folder that the new program would not find.

Just after midnight on May 1, 2010, I tried another update. As promised, it did not work. That part of the program was cut off at midnight on April 30, probably by an update to Quicken 2007 that arrived earlier in the day.

I said a little prayer, and inserted the Quicken H&B 2010 CD into my computer. It gently removed QW2007, installed QW2010, found my files, offered to store a copy of the original in case I wanted to go back to QW2007 and offered me a choice of which files to convert to the new format. By 12:30 am I was doing an update on all my files with the bank, credit cards, and investments.

The basics of doing the day to day work with the program remain the same but there are some interesting changes in appearance, information offered, and how different parts of the program are presented. I can see that there is a lot to learn, if I am interested.

Since I first discovered Quicken 4, at the suggestion of my accountant, I have updated every few years and been happy with the changes. While I plan to experiment with GnuCash to see how that is developing and how it compares to Quicken, I will probably stay with Quicken H&B 2010 as my main financial program.

My thanks to all previous reviewers for their shared experience.

"I adore Word Perfect, been using it since the Monmons came out with the first version.

This is faster, cleaner, lots more settings, and the high point as always is its ""Reveal Code"" button so when one wishes you can see exactly what is controlling your text format.

"I started trying Powerdirctor from its 5th version. PowerDirector has some nice features. But at every video task my kids and I tried to do, it has never been a smooth process.  It crashed so many times during the process that I had to save for each step. After you finally passed editing and authoring part, it started its very slow and long producing (generate MPEG file) part. You just pray it would not stop in the middle, and unfortunately it often did. And in the final burning stage (write to DVD), it can also stuck some where, which means you have to repeat the painful process again.  That night, my daughter's little video project was due the following day, so she just needed to get it done, But 2 minutes of small video project turned into a 6-hour of nightmare. We burned DVD 3 times, and still could not get that to play on two of our DVD players.

  The reason I still tried to use PowerDirector is that it is one of the few to allow me to drop my DVD Video Camera's file directly into the program. I don't know why other software do not allow me to do that?  Like I said, this program has some nice features, but if it cannot make  basic functions running smoothly, it is worthless.

  After wasting $100 for this one, I'm in the process of finding another video editing tool again. Adobe Premier is too complicated and too expensive, all the others have all kind of problems. Maybe it's time to switch to MAC again."
"Really nice job walking you through the process.  I have not used any before so I can't compare,  but for me being a newbie I thought this was great.  I would recommend it."
Es muy buena
"Save your money and don't upgrade.  I bought windows 8, went through the whole install and at the end was told that the install could not be completed, I did everything that was indicated by the Windows 8 installer.  I was given any reason as to why, I decided not to mess w/it and just returned windows 8.  After it failed to install I got an uneasy feeling about it.

Update:  Due to this failed install I forced to restore my system completely.  Absolutely everything stopped working, even though my laptop is less then a year old and so far hasn't experienced a single problem until Windows 8 hit.  When I called tech support I was rudely accused of doing something wrong and was told that I shouldn't be installing these things unless I have good knowledge about the operating systems.  Well I know it doesn't take a genius to install an operating system that is designed for easy install.  I was also told that they could repair mys system for a fee (this is before I reset it), why should I pay money for damage caused by your faulty operating system.  I was not a happy camper.  Now my computer is back to normal and I'm sticking to Windows 8.

New update:  I am writing to say w/the restore I haven't had any problems w/my pc, Windows 8 just created time consuming problems, I'm thankful I got my money back.  I paid a low price for it and now I would install this even if this version was free.  Buyer beware!"
Easy to use and navigate

"I recently upgraded to QB 2014 from QB 2011, not because I wanted to or because it was any better, it's not, but since I use QB payroll, I had no choice.  Then to add salt to the wound I had to renew my QB payroll, for an additional $483.24, which I was unable to do payroll because there was a glitch in the software, finally fixed.  Thanks for the gun to my head Intuit.  I understand Sage has a decent product.  If I did not have 2 company files on QB, I would find another accounting software package.  Now for the good part.  I have nothing but praise for Amazon, unfortunately I did not purchase it from them I purchased from TigerDirect, big mistake!  The software was ordered on the morning of 4/2/14,  that afternoon I found it locally for a better price.  Immediately called TigerDirect to cancel the order and was told they did not think it would be possible as the supplier was probably arranging to ship it.  The product was shipped 1 week later.  After receiving the software and promptly returning it, i had return authorization, the charge was finally credited to my card on 5/2/14.  Will never again purchase from TigerDirect.  Amazon you have my business."
"I liked all the options in this software. There were a lot of filters you could use. You could transfer objects in and out and change things you don't like. You can work in layers.

I thought this was very user friendly. Of course I needed some instruction and had to get used to it but overall it was not as difficult as some of the other photo editing programs I have used. I really enjoyed testing out the different features. It's amazing how much you can improve your photographs."
great image program at reasonable price
"After loading Adobe Reader XI, it worked for what I needed it to, but a video pops up on startup that has a tiny close box on it that was difficult to find. Now videos seem to Pop-a-Top up everywhere & at all times. It even changed the resolution on my homepage"
"Don't Buy Microsoft Windows 10 Pro.

My first negative try at this review at Amazon was pulled because I recommend an alternative operating system. People need to be educated why Windows 10 Pro is a bad product. One -- the updates are data mining the user. Two --  if you have a hardware failure, buy replacement hardware and even if you have the original Windows branding code you will not be able to activate your system. One upgrade will shut it down! I build computers and have spent thousands of dollars on Amazon buying parts.

Last point -- Your operating system should protect you! And not the other way around were the operating system feeds constant information about you to Microsoft for sale. There also the AMT report.. And it also advertise products on your computer! Who needs Facebook when your running Microsoft?"
Doing it's job!
"First off, I am not real computer savvy. I started experiencing a lot of pop up adds, and it seemed like I was being misdirected on my web programs. I played around with all of the Microsoft settings for the web security and thought I had it fixed. Started happening again so I did some reading on Antivirus software. Webroot got good ratings from PC Magazine so I went with it. $20 seemed reasonable so I installed and started using it. It immediately found a half dozen problems like Adware(?) and cleaned everything up. I occasionally will run a manual scan but it hasn't found anything since. I don't know if its catching viruses before they infect or what. Like I say, so far, so good."
"Wilson Software, Inc:  Tournament Texas Hold'em
  For anyone who wants to practice before going into a live game, this program is excellent!  It is fast moving, clear and easy to use.  The ""zip"" feature allows you to rapidly progress to the end of the hand after folding.  The sound is fine, but I prefer to play without it so as not to disturb my wife, as we share our ""office"" space.  I really feel that I am becoming more prepared to take on live players at a poker table."
"No one said that learning a second language is easy or that it doesn't take conscientious effort to learn. So far I am about halfway through Spanish I, and I am amazed how much I have learned by doing one or two lessons a night. But each lesson requires about a half hour, and there are 100 lessons in Spanish 1, so you will get some idea of the commitment required. I can't wait to see how much I will know once I've completed more of the program."
"Few bugs, but works well"
"I have been running this on 3 PCs, a Win XP desktop that is 9 years old, a Win Vista laptop and a Win 7 laptop and so far I have not had any problems. I have not used the online backup and i am not sure what i can save in 20GB worth of space and I already have a backup plan with redundant external drives. I have not had any performance problems and so far everything seems to be working fine."
"This review is on the word processing, PDF, and eBook features, all of which are fabulous.

I.  WordPerfect is superior to Word for word processing.  After a small learning curve, if you are going from Work to WordPerfect, then WordPerfect is actually easier to use.  First, WordPerfect, (""WP"") is more intuitive than Word. Second, WP has better features, such a better dictionary and grammar and thesaurus capabilities.  Third, WP does not clog up your screen space on small devices with a ribbon user interface of things you don't want to do and don't need to do but allows you to create a smaller, customized ribbon of shortcuts to things you actually use.

II.  The PDF editor function is a great feature as you can use it to not merely create but also edit PDF documents from third parties.  This is not only convenient, it allows you to forego buying a separate Adobe Acrobat program.

III.  The eBook Publisher function is so easy to use it is incredible!  You basically just select ""eBook Publisher"" from the menu, go to ""Create"" and it pretty much creates the book for you, step by step, except for that tricky part where you write the book itself.  This is especially useful if you want to create a MOBI eBook for Amazon Kindle.

Finally, the entire program, i.e., WordPerfect Standard Office X8, is a great value because you can download it to three computers.  The only catch is that only one of the three computers is supposed to be using the program at a time.  (I haven't tested this limitation.  Nor do I suggest anyone else tempt fate.  I don't think any of the computers, or the program, would crash.  Using the program on one computer might simply lock it up while in use so that the other computers cannot access the program.  [I'm not a techie, so don't laugh if this is unrealistic.] Or you just might get a gentle inquiry from Corel on when they will receive your payment for your purchase of another Office X8 program.)"
Does your taxes easily.  No extra fluff is needed here.  Taxcut standard and money software for free.  How could you go wrong.
Works Great as always
I am using it for last 2 years. Happy with it. Only thing want to mention did not see much change in 2014 n 2013.
"I've been using Malwarebytes for a while now. The software has a minimal footprint, doesn't create conflicts with the antivirus and, most importantly, catches and blocks nearly every malware link that comes my way off the Internet. No regrets buying this product!"
"I am not using this program. It interfered too much with system operation and insisted I use all parts of the program when I tried to customize. I do not like the ""Zen"" feature at all. PC tuneup was much better, but it had to be uninstalled."
"I use this software to edit movies shot with a SONY HDRXR550V. It does it's job without crashing or noticeable slow-downs and it can render to a variety of file formats. There are still problems with a lot of MP4 flavored files (import or render to) but there are viable alternatives and workarounds for this problem. This is a good value for the money, but the real thing (Vegas Pro 10) is what every serious Hi-Def video enthusiast should have. That's what I would have bought if it didn't cost ~$500. Anyway, at least anyone can enjoy a free 30 day trial of the Pro version if they want a taste of it..."
"MS actually did a decent job with this release of the operating system. They brought back a lot of the things that they removed from 8 that made it almost unusable especially in a business environment. I've had few if any software compatibility or driver installation issues across dozens of Win 10 installations.
One thing to note is that if you buy it through MS online you will not be furnished a product code, and if you have any issues with your installation be prepared to spend literally hours fighting their customer service to get the problem resolved. Because of this I've taken to buying the boxed product at local retailers or through Amazon's digital services so I'll get a product key.

Yes you will be given a product key along with instructions to download after you complete the purchase - at least we have been.  We weren't sure before purchasing and almost decided against it."
I've been using for 10+ years and it is efficient. Only thing that irks me is having  to pay the $19.99 for filing the state portion.
"Great software, and excellent price!"
"Spysweeper went to the dark side with version 5, avoid it. It slows your machine down. It also had conflicts with Thunderbird email on my machine.

Uninstalling Spysweeper speeded up my computer.

PLUS --> Try and turn Spysweeper off. If you uncheck the load at start-up option and restart your computer Spysweeper is still running -- check it out in the task manager. So Spysweeper makes your computer run slower, and runs in the background even if you don't want it to -- isn't that the kind of software behavior it supposed to be preventing??

Once Spysweeper was uninstalled my email ports showed a lot less weird port activity too. Hmm."
"not excel, but close, have to work around it to figure out."
"All the advantages of WordPerfect that I adore, but without the hefty price."
"I think this toy is great.  My son is only 3 and a half and got this for Christmas this year.  I was a little concerned he wouldn't be successful playing the game.  I was happy to see that the game has multiple levels of difficulty and that he could even play some sections at level 3 already.  He loves it, and it has helped him learn the names of the tools and to problem solve so that he has the right tool for the job!!"
This was my 5th consecutive year using TaxCut. It sure makes it simple to have the data carry forward from year to year.
"very good software, and very simple to use."
No complaints.
"Easy to use, but all the self-prepatory software programs are pretty easy these days.

I find the software to be on the expensive side, slightly, compared with others but I am very upset at the expense of $30 to have my refund check deposited into my checking account - for my federal refund and an additional $20 for the state refund to be deposited into my account.

That means that I spent over $50 for the purchase of the software disc, plus another $50 for automatic deposits for my refunds.  Too much money.

Lastly, I tried submitting my state refund and because of a computer glitch or some other lame excuse for international scamming, I was sent an email apologizing for the inconvenience and was offered a $25 rebate on my TurboTax purchase.  I found this to be an absolute joke as I entered my info and ID number of my product and was informed that my purchase wasn't eligible for the rebate/payment for inconvenience.  What a friggin' joke.

This has PO'd me to the point that this will be my last Intuit purchase and I will not recommend your products to anyone from this point forward.

BTW - I have used TurboTax for probably 20 years now and as I said - NO MORE."
"I'm not sure what planet some of these other ""reviewers"" are on.. but the H&R block product is SUPERB. I am also a ""Software Engineer""... and I can tell you that this software is better designed and executed than some of the comparable TurboTax products.

TurboTax has been getting the proverbial ""run for their money"" this year with the competing H&R Block products so it's understandable that they are trying to preserve market share against a competitor they view as moving in on their ""turf"" so to speak. I feel honestly quite certain that some of the reviews are reflective of that issue. That is, be wary of negative reviews of this product as they may be unfairly biased in favor of TurboTax.

1. I had NO (ZERO) installation problems on my machine.

2. The program does EXACTLY what it is supposed to do for LESS money than the comparable TurboTax product

I heartily reccomend this product over the competing TurboTax product."
Unusable and crude.
"I have had this software for a while, but I prefer other imaging software on my computer.
PS Pro X4 is very slow to open, and it is not an intuitive program for me. It takes a lot of fiddling to get it to do what I am trying to do. My photography is pretty basic, mostly snapshots on a point and shoot camera, and sometimes on my phone. The other software that I have is easier to use and gives very similar results.
I do not like the filing system used in PS Pro, it is clumsy to use, and I find it cumbersome to edit series of photos.
It may work very well for a professional photographer or graphic artist, but it is not for me, since it frustrates me."
Horrible the progrsm came fast and everything but the cd key don't work don't order this is bot worth it
Like every year I wait for the Black Friday deals to renew my trusted AntiMalware provider subscription.
"I have to totally agree with that last gentlemen, this software is junk!!! First it wouldn't download correctly then after 2 hours playing with that part the program error: error code 046C. After many attempts of installation, I simple gave up and requested a refund. Do yourself a huge favor, don't buy this software. Sad.......and no phone number to call to ask for help. They did provide a ""live chat"" that too was a waste."
"This product does what it advertises. It does take a while to download
the information, so expect to start the process and leave for a while."
"I purchased this software on a deal, planning to import my previous year HandR block data into it. Previously I have filed in H and R block offices, and last year I filed on H and R blocks website.

It turns out you can only import your previous returns if you did them via H and R block or Turbotax software. I contacted H and R block customer support, and was told you can import data from the software to online version, but not from the online to software version. H&R BLOCK PRODUCTS ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ONE ANOTHER.

The H&R Block rep offered to refund my software purchase, but was not able to do so since I purchased the software through Amazon. I can't find a way to get a refund for the software from Amazon. I have sent a message to Amazon. I hope they will help.

It is not worth any deal to buy this software from Amazon if it can't be returned."
"It slows down system to a complete crawl. Even though it claims on the McAfee website that it is compatible with Windows Vista, it isn't!! There are issues during the installation process, and if you do get it installed there are further problems, it actually crashed my system and I had to start up in safe mode and restore to before I installed the software. I have it on a Dell with Windows XP and a Sony with Windows Vista, it has successfully crashed my Dell and I need to completely wipe the computer and reinstall the operating system, and my Sony has trouble accessing websites. DON'T BUY THIS SOFTWARE FOR ANY REASON!!! It may seem like a great deal, and there are some people who have good reviews, but I'm here to tell you, the software works for about 2 weeks before completely destroying your computer."
"If you are on the internet, you are a target.  Of course there are those that will tell you that Apple computers can't get a virus.  I only say....yet.  Some hacker is working on just that right now, and soon he will succeed, then listen to the Apple-ites cry!

If you have a PC, and you are looking for a quick and user friendly Security System, the Trend Internet Security software is for you.  It has features not available on higher priced models.  You can use it to protect or police your teen or youngster from finding ""those"" websites that nobody knows about.  It can prevent any damaging file from entering your computer through a USB port.  That is worth the price of the software.

But wait, there's more.  The system uses about 20% less space than the high priced brands.

The interface is user friendly.  There is even a ""quick scan"" option when you don't have the time for a deep scan of your system.

It not only detects viruses, spyware, and other malicious threats from your computer, email, instant messages, and downloads it REMOVES them!  You can also use it to keep SPAM (text and images) out of your email.  And it is pro-active.  It searches for trouble BEFORE it becomes trouble.  You can also trust it to block troublesome links in instant messages!

How much would you pay to feel secure when surfing the internet?  For under $40, you can breathe a sigh of relief. Thanks, Trend!"
Didn't solve problem.
So far I have no problem!!!
Product key will let you install it but didn't register w Microsoft.. said I had to call them
"Ehh.  I bought Office Home and Student 2016 edition to replace my Office Home and Student 2007 edition.  The 2007 edition allowed you to load office on up to 3 computers.  The 2016 edition only allows you to load office on 1 computer.  If you replace your computer, you have to buy MS Office again.

Excel and Word 2016 crashed when I opened the program.  I had a Abbey Fine Reader add-on.  The add-on crashed excel and word.  I had to open excel and word in safe-mode and uncheck Abbey Fine Reader in the options screen.

Excel charts on the 2007 were notoriously slow.  If I had a half dozen complex charts on a worksheet, it took some time for Excel to display the charts.  Excel 2016 displays the charts almost instantly.  I am not sure if this is because of an excel improvement or because I am using 64-bit excel instead of 32-bit excel.

My computer has a wide screen monitor, yet I still can't view charts in a widescreen mode.  I use a work around of setting the chart size to 11x17, but this still does not fill up the screen.

Excel 2016 has the chart options located in the right panel of the screen, which is good, as it uses part of the wasted space of the widescreen.  But then they placed some of the chart options in the right panel tabs.  So it is still a little pain in the neck to make changes to changes to the chart options."
"Why would you even need a manual. The company has free how to tutorials that show you, step by step, how to do everything. It's like having your own private teacher."
This is the quickest and easiest way to upgrade your version of Windows 7 Premium to Professional and you are saving money compared to buying directly from Microsoft.
This is an excellent product and Amazon provided it at an extremely reasonable price.  for this I am grateful.
I have to return this because it is not at all helping me out
"I've used Dragon NaturallySpeaking since version 2 through version 10. MacSpeech is a real pain compared to  Dragon NaturallySpeaking. Its versatility, accuracy, correction, all need a lot of improvement. Frankly, two stars is a gift  Santa Fe Bob"
"I am with the other reviewers who are outraged by the devaluation of Turbo Tax. When I first started using it years ago, even Basic would let you handle uncomplicated capital gains. At some point I switched to Deluxe, but in 2014 found I would need to pay $30 more just to report about $200 in capital gains. Fortunately I was using the online version, so could stop without paying. I found another online program that was slightly clunkier, but could handle both federal and state returns for about $20. No more Turbo Tax for me."
"By far, this is the easiest Quickbooks to date.  Have used Quickbooks for years and each new version is a great improvement over the last. Easy to understand and allows for quick entries. Would recommend it to anyone in business."
Its really good. I am using kaspersky internet security from last 10 yrs and I just love this. It is really good. This version has extra protection like pasword key. But not sure is it really works or not.
Excellent as always!
ordered  sound pool 14 4 months ago have not seen it yet  BAD DEAL
I am not messing with T-Tax any more....just bought H &R Block instead....
"This is the best picture editing software I have ever used, and I have used a bunch.  The only issue here is that it is a very large and powerfull program and there is a lot to learn.  Fortunately it has a tutoring portion, and a good ""how to"" book included."
I do think TurboTax is the best way to do taxes.  It's just that I can't give anything higher than a 3 to anything that has to do with taxes!
Just a warning to anyone who is using a previous version of Peachtree and are using user defined payroll formulas instead of subscribing to a payroll service. YOU CAN NO LONGER ENTER USER DEFINED PAYROLL FORMULAS WITHOUT SUBSCRIBING TO ONE OF SAGE'S PAYROLL SERVICES! I think this is B.S. This adds a minimum of 299.95 per year to process payroll. You now have to manually calculate the amounts and fill them in for each payroll check.
"We received used software.  Unable to use it at all.  We were unable to get a hold of both Sony and the ""store"" that sold it to us.  Great disappointment and complete waste of money."
Good
"I was loathe to upgrade from Paperport 9 to Paperport 12 because of all the bad reviews I had read about Paperport 11 (sorry for all the numbers). However, I had to when I bought a new computer and could not find my original disc to load Paperport 9.

I was very pleasantly surprised by the outcome. Purchasing the product was simple and at a discounted price. The software loaded and installed very easily on my new computer. When I opened Paperport 12, it was already synched with my scanner and printer. Importing old data was a simple one-step drag-and-drop process from my flash drive.

Nuance has delivered on it's promises regarding the new look of Paperport 12 and it's speed. The new look is very attractive, user-friendly,and has many new options. One of my complaints about my older version of Paperport is that it seemed to take forever to load my data. As advertised, the new version is much, much faster at this. Of course, that can also have to do with having a newer, faster computer.

In all, my experience with Paperport 12 has been very positive. I would recommend this product."
"I have recently purchased this product 2/09 and cannot get it to update virus definitions. Calling the support line is a joke. I have requested help no less than 3 times online and have yet to get 1 reply. It gets worse too, I have to disable the antivirus to open web pages as it just locks up everything from email to reading the sports page. I re-enable the software after browsing, and then have it do a 2 hour clean so I can browse again the next day. Save yourself the headaches, get something else!"
Corel has improved on an already great product.  Possibilities are unlimited!!  Easy to use and learn.
"This package of Miku V3 comes complete with 6 voices, piapro studio vocal editor, studio one 2.0, and presonus digital instruments. I have to say that the packaging and quality of this Vocaloid is top notch which is to be expected from Crypton Future Media, but it's nice to know Saki Fujita took recording in English very seriously. I know some people have mixed feelings about Miku V3 English, but I am one of those that say you have to use her yourself before casting a bias opinion. I am currently working on learning the new voices since I only owned Miku V2 Original up to this point. Now onto the voicebanks in this package.

- Hatsune Miku V3 Original is the exact same voice library as Miku V2, but has much more clarity and definition to her voice than before.
- Hatsune Miku V3 Soft has a softer and more gentle tone than original, but still retains much power and clarity.
- Hatsune Miku V3 Dark has a more mature voice and a deep vocal tone almost like an opera singer.
- Hatsune Miku V3 Sweet has a really cute child like voice with a soft tone similar to Kaito V3 Whisper.
- Hatsune Miku V3 Solid has a powerful piercing vocal range easily able to drive strong through rock and alternative songs.
- Hatsune Miku V3 English has a tone similar to Miku original, but a more mature sound to her voice. She can sing English rather clearly considering she still has the cute character voice tone.

If you have any further questions feel free to leave a comment! ^ ^"
Lets me run window XP and MAC X on the same machine.  Runs MS software on the MAC than on the PC
"A good, necessary tool!"
"This was even easier than I had hoped.  It was simple to download, then just plug in the adapter to the VCR player.  I especially love that I don't have to record all the previews/commercials, etc. that go before the movie.  I'm a teacher and have been collecting great videos for years, but when our school was modernized they did away with TVs and VCR/DVD combos - we show everything through our laptop and projectors.  I was so happy that this worked.  The only thing is that I wish there was some sort of speed recording thing, you just have to let the video play on your laptop while it's burning the DVD.  It's not a big deal - I recorded movies on the laptop while watching another movie on my TV or doing chores around the house.  Simple and easy!!!"
"The software itself is ok. I'm very disappointed with the fact that I bought a product that needs another product, ie..turbo tax to finish doing what I need to to. Not surprised that intuit also sells turbo tax. It's like buying a car, and having to buy a steering wheel to drive it. Very dissapointed in this product. I wish I had been better informed before my purchase. I won't buy a product made by this company ever again.

BILL GATES...PLEASE BRING BACK MICROSOFT MONEY FOR BUSINESS. IT BLOWS THIS PRODUCT AWAY."
If you call Apple's 800 retail number (800 MYAPPLE) you can order this upgrade for $20. It is a complete rip off on amazon. Over the phone is the only way Apple sells it anymore--you can't order it online or by going to an apple store.
"I work with a LOT of machines and this software has saved a number of people's behinds when their drives got corrupted or began to fail. (It makes me look good too)
There's now a downloadable update to version 4.4 to make the program run properly in Lion.
If you work with a lot of macs, GET THIS. It works on disk images, will help even when a file system check won't, and I've also used it to recover files from drives that were failing and badly clicking."
Good
Did not work in the computer..... or dvd player
I ordered this product because the description of the Premium package did not indicate that it was good for 5 devices. I was lead to believe that I had to order this product in order to install the Premium product on more than one device!
Good Software
"Bought because i already have act data based set up using 2009. We do not need any new features and already have 10,"
No problem.  Turbo-tax always reliable.
"I have had the 2 previous versions of Pyro, and like the other uses here stated, they were intuitive and great.  I actually did a lot of WAVE editing for a few fashion shows, and the result is not any different from projects done on ProTools.

I have VISTA 32bit with Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2.8GHz and 3G of RAM.  This was a complete waste of $40.  It did not load right initially, and it turned out it was having issues with my external USB interface.  I tired to load it with he built in sound card that came with the PC and it loaded and worked fine.  It let me switch over to the external USB interface after it was loaded.

Now I would give it a 3 star instead of one.  The panel is more detailed but not as intuitive, so some playing around with it is a must.  There are new features such as markers which makes light WAVE editing easier.

If it loads easily with an outboard interface initially, I would have given it 5 stars..."
A very large selection of instruments and many are customizable to make your own unique sounds.  I bit overwhelming at first but after reading the manual and watching a few video tutorials it becomes easy to learn.
Love it....
"Installed no problem, runs great and glad I bought it. Same experience with Norton Internet Security 2004 - I see all these folks who are having massive problems and headaches with both these programs, so I don't know what I'm doing right (or wrong?). Only glitch is the additinal GoBack personal edition that came bundled with Systemworks - after installing it the computer wouldn't get past the XP bootup screen. Had to disable GoBack to get past that then finally uninstall it. Symantic supposedly has a fix for this on their website, and I might try it sometime. Doesn't really matter - I don't really need GoBack. Windows system restore is sufficient for my purposes. Other than that Systemworks runs great."
"I've owned two previous versions of Studio, including version 9. All of them have been unstable and have crashed either while editing or when rendering. This version 11 seems to have solved the problems. I have produced a 35 minute video including rendering to DVD without a single crash. A confusion factor is that when installed, it indicates you have  Studio Plus rather than Studio Ultimate. Blu-ray projects work great!"
"If you are like me and want to closely track your income and spending (checks, bills, credit cards, insurance, etc.) then Quicken is for you.  I have used Quicken for several years after Microsoft Money suddenly stopped supporting their product.  Quicken has proven to be a step ahead, better money management software tool for me than Money.  In addition, Quicken works seamlessly with my credit union, credit card companies, and investment house.  I highly recommend that every family / couple manage their money and wealth using Quicken from your home PC.  It does take a bit of time to initially set up and learn, but it is time well spent."
My son uses this. Works great.
"Good product, I would recommend!"
"I have always used Microsoft Office products and when they switched over to the subscription based approach, I wasn't sure if I would like that.  Well it turns out that it's not so bad as you always stay up to date.  If you like the idea of just buying it once then this isn't for you.  They still sell it so that you can install it on one PC (or tablet) so you would have to buy it for every device.  The subscription based version has a one PC/Tablet or 5 PC/Tablet option.

As far as the products included, they have thus far worked just as expected."
"My main objection to this bundle is that the Norton Utilities DOES NOT WORK with Macintosh computers. The anti-virus program is not great but OK, however I was very displeased to learn half the bundle was inoperative with the computer operating system it advertised as being compatible. Beware of this software bundle if you are a MacUser."
Love ND games so what else can I say!!!
I don't know if the above reviews were paid for.  This software would not work from the box from the moment I installed it.  I have a computer BS degree and still couldn't get the software to recognize the vidbox was plugged in.  I then tried using Golden VHS software and couldn't get it to recognize the audio output.  It recorded the video just fine.  I could hear the audio yet the box didn't capture it.  Don't waste your money.
This software is designed so friendly that I can easily make my own manga-style comic...this tool is truly a godsend. Thank you.
Fails to install under Windows 8.1 OS
I've played a demo and it's the coolest it's worth the wait and money
"Product works great on my Apple Computer.  I am now able to not only view my Excel Worksheets, but edit them as well."
I use this product (Actually Version 10 now) extensively. Works great and does what I want it to do. The quality of my videos are stellar after conversions or capture.
"This is an awesome product that I would highly recommend, and do so, to any and all.  It has everything in one convenient package - Word, Excel, Power Point, and One Note.  It is easy to download, easy to use, and easy to find templates and how to's online.  I especially like the ease of Word and One Note.  With One Note, if my printer is not working, that is ok - I can simply ""print"" to One Note, where I can easily file it and find it later to print out."
I haven't figured out how to do things that were simple with the 3.0 edition.  But the 3.0 doesn't work with my new windows 7.
"I purchased Jump Start Preschool and Kinderkarten along with Dora the Explorer: Lost and Found Adventure. I loaded both programs, each on a seperate computer in my home office, and allowed my 7 year old and 3 year old to have unlimited access to both programs. The kids played with both programs, sometimes sharing and sometimes one each. After a half hour, the winner became clear. Dora was abandoned for the Jump Start program. Both the kids are sitting around the same computer sharing the Preschool and Kindergarten program. The 7 year old is showing the 3 year old how to handle the environment and they've been glued to it for over three hours now. I asked my 7 year old what's wrong with Dora and she said bluntly, ""it's boring."" She then screamed ""I got a pet!"" and turned back to Jump Start. The three year old is obviously following the 7 year old so I checked out Dora myself and quickly realised it's over-complicated and, yes, boring.

P.S. I signed up with the monthly $8 for the online expansion for Jump Start. Good work to the people at Jump Start!

Thanks,

"I wasted my money on this. I am nowhere near being able to talk Afrikaans. But this is due to lazyness, lack of displine and the fact I, here in Norway, have no one around me I can talk Afrikaans to, let alone get a hand in teaching it to me.

I got this because my best friend lives in RSA. He's a white person, but one of the English speaking ones, so he doesn't understand why I bother with this.

I guess I just find the Afrikaaner culture and people fascinating. Everyone mostly go on about the black culture in South Africa, but I think it's the rest that are itneresting, as it is unique to Africa. So I thought I could learn a language not everyone else speaks!

But like I said...

Still, this is a fun way to learn. I really like it. I get it out from time to time and try and get started, but, well, there's distractions and I'm not that good and self tuition.

But, maybe somoene reading this is, so I say, yeah, this IS a good way to help you get started, to learn Afrikaans.

Tot siens!"
"Give Amazon a negative 10 for recommending and selling Vista software.  The software is complete junk.  I know that Amazon didn't design this software, but Amazon should have at least checked out Vista before they sold it.  If they would have checked out the software first they would have known that Vista is a complete failure.  It will be a long time before I can trust Amazon again."
Don't purchase this disk. I was told by my IT guy that this type of software should be free and that it is illegal to purchase. I would like to return it if the company sees this message.
"From the FAQ:
  ""Can I upgrade from a 32-bit version of Windows to a 64-bit version of Windows 8?

  If your PC has a 64 bit-capable processor (CPU) but is currently running a 32-bit version of Windows, you can install a 64-bit version of Windows 8. You also won't be able to keep any files,  settings, or software programs when you upgrade from a 32-bit to a 64-bit version.""

^^ this is not actually correct.  I tried it, installer told me I needed to use the 32 bit version.  Google'd, seems that in the past MS would allow cross architecture and apparently now they do not.  If there is a workaround or I missed something please let me know and I'll edit or delete, but as of now I think amazon needs to take that bit down from the faq.  I returned this version and bought a full version instead."
"I am not finished with it by a long shot.  But it is better than other Spanish DVDs or books I have ever used.  It starts with subject and verbs and the difference between the English version and the Spanish version.  I would definitely recommend this course for anyone -- adult or child alike.

Purchased product through Amazon without problem. Tried loading Print Shop 23 on my HP Vista 64 bit system with 6 GB RAM and 500 GB Hard Drive. Couldn't do it as I kept getting error messages. Tried calling Encore per instruction booklet. Electronic message for Print Shop 23 said to go on line for tech support. Encore's web site indicates that most of their products are not approved for 64 bit Windows XP or Vista systems unless it specifies 64 bit on the box. Print Shop 23 just indicates Windows XP and Vista with no bit amount specified. Seems it would save everyone trouble if they specified bit amount on the outside of the box or in their specs. Very unprofessional in my opinion.
"I believe TurboTax to be the best tax completion program on the market ... bar none!  By having used it I am fully confident that my taxes are done correctly and that I did not miss a single deduction.

Downloaded but wouldn't run . Just messed up everything can't even open my emails! waste of my money! Know what you are doing before you buy something like this.
"Bought the new Microsoft Word for Mac to do a monthly volunteer newsletter and found that it runs like molasses on a G4 Powerbook. So, I bought IWork for the 'Pages' program. This program is easy to use and easy to learn. It's very much like the old PageMaker for Macs. Converts easily to PDF for sharing. Would have given it 5 starts, but I think that anything can be improved. Otherwise, there would never be new versions. Only negative - I would have liked to buy 'Pages' as a stand alone application. I have no need for the other apps."
I'm very happy.
"I like the program and needed to purchase it, but would like to get the price you offered it to me for when you sent me a sale induced ad for $100 off, seriously."
Best game we have bought so far .  She did need some initial help on the adventure on getting from plavce to place.  After 30 minutes she was moving right along!
its help my son with math alot. he enjoyed it it like playing a game but very educational for the to learn math
"This item was easy to to downlown and install. Its good for three users. Not sure if it acutally working, but I can say I haven't experienced a virus on my laptop."
"Easy to install, and even easier to use.  Now I can keep an eye on my home from my office. Just what I needed and at a great price!!"
Works great! Love it!
"Trend makes an antivirus product that is effective, easy to use and stops email attacks before they can gain access to your computer. While some antivirus software brings things to a crawl PC-Cillin 2000 uses the smallest amount of system resources of any antivirus progarm I have found. You can completely control everything the software does, using one of the best interfaces on the market. It has several scans you can select, the product popups and warnings can be even be determined by the user. The system scans are very fast and automatic. More than twice as fast as Norton. It works well on any Windows Operating System, and Trend allows XP and other Window users to evaluate the software for a month for free which includes virus updates. Finally...you get the CD at a very good price if you have a hard drive problem or change computers it is there for you to use. The technical support using email is excellent if you need to send a virus package for evaluation."
Great software.
"Quicken is a top notch product, allowing you to manage your finances completely  from budgets to bills. They keep improving the product every year as well, so it's definitely a worthwhile investment."
Getting the 'Administrator error' and from my internet searches I am not the only one. They have pages on their website dedicated to how to fix this (why don't they just fix the software?) and none of it worked. This is a fly by night hack software solution that is not supported fully and would be fine if they presented it that way and charged a nominal fee. This is not a real software solution and I whole heartedly discourage anyone from risking their computer with it or supporting a company that is falsely portraying itself like this.
"Great Product, easy to use."
"As other reviewers have stated even 1 star is too good.  Total scam.  Please don't buy, you will regret it.  I purchased this from H H Gregg, a very poor decision."
"The addictive nature of this program has been referred to by another reviewer - but it's true! My wife sees little of me in the evenings as I add yet another branch to my family tree. I have been using family historian since its original inception, and each version does the imopossible - improves on an already brilliant product. I've actually tried a number of family tree software programs over the years and this one outshines them all by far. If I were to name all the benefits of this program, this review would be too long, but just a sampling are as follows:

1) ease of use for a relatively computer illiterate person like myself
2) diagrams and reports are fantastic - trees and reports have made wonderful family gifts over the years
3) importing and exporting as gedcoms couln't be easier
4) great range of file formats for saving diagrams and reports
5) new media page with version 4 provides a great snapshot of family linkages, particualrly with photographs
6) help information and ""getting the most from family historian"" are excellent resources

There's much more I could add, and as I continue to explore the options with FH4, no doubt I'll find additional enticing ways to portray my family data. The authors of this software have done a terrific job and I have no problem providing my strongest recommendation possible for this software."
"My computer would not accept it, therefore I had to return it."
I received the product and have yet been able to use it. It will not install properly on Windows 7. I became so frustrated installing and removing and reinstalling. It was an older version but do indicate would work with Windows 7. It does not!!
"Santa brought this for Christmas for our 7 year old and not only does he play it, his 4 year old sister, mom and dad are all avid players.  Fun game, fun shopping, and fun creating aquariums.  Would highly recommend the game."

"To tell you the truth, I don't know why I bought the 2015 update, I had the 2014 premier and used 2015 now for a few months and cannot see any difference. There might have been some fixes that I didn't notice. It works fine. I do like the cloud feature, no trouble there. Knowing your credit score is useless to me unless you plan to buy a house, car, or plan to finance a major purchase. I have been using Quicken for years and I was duked in buying this. ""upgrade""."

To lay the foundations of your language learning they use short, useless help files (a one-page list of the letters of the alphabet and a very sparse introduction to the different parts of speech) and nothing else. What they're selling individually for $90 was originally all bundled together for $10 on the ""101 Languages of the World"" CD, but as you can imagine they're making quite the killing doing things this way. There are a few reviewers who seem to actually -believe- the product deserves 5 stars but I seriously doubt they've ever used any other language software in their life. I'm convinced you'd learn more Spanish from Dora the Explorer's Happytime Funland."
"I haven't seen it in action yet that I can recall, but I will have the latest"
"Recently switched from PC to Mac and was a Quicken for Windows user for over 15 years. Extremely disappointed with the Quicken Essentials for Mac. Bought this product and found it to be a much better product than Quicken Essentials. I now have all of the functionality I used to have in Quicken including including investment transactions, plus newer features and easier downloading. I like the format for reconciling bank accounts as well."
"I wanted something simple for writing lists, letters and address labels.  Nothing appeared to be simple
and I could not find a way to print labels.  It might be fine for those who want something more
complicated but it is not for me."
"Makes taxes seem more complex than they actually are. The cloying ""let us help you with that"" interface is as infuriating as almost anything the IRS does. There is a (non-obvious) way to just to get to the forms, but it's clearly designed with a paternalism reminiscent of the days when geeks controlled access to computers. Here we seem to have geeks controlling access to your tax filing. I also think it downloads a lot more stuff from the network than it needs to. Perhaps this is some kind of IP protection on their part.  It seems to have done the taxes correctly but one is left feeling ""I hope they're right because I'm not sure what they did"". Yes, you may have that feeling with an accountant, but at least you're aware of his/her professional qualifications wrt taxes.  I didn't like some of the approaches they took in itemizing some deductions;  for example the charitable deductions were needlessly complicated. The premier version is overkill unless you have an ongoing business that is more involved than simple real property and rental income. We ended up doing out state taxes the old fashioned way as we got fed up with the interface. I give it three stars because the taxes appeared to not have any errors; very unlikely to use it again, though."
as expected

"I have been working on purchasing language software, and have found that the Learn Now series does not work with Windows 2000.  I noticed in another comment that they had the same issue.  The program itself looked like it would have been pretty good, but I did not get a good opportunity to use it since it locked my system up.  I worked with the technical support people at Transparent Language, but they could not figure out why it was happening."
This is a Windows only program. I wish there were a Mac version. But it works as advertised and s useful if the user does not have a complicated estate. Nolo really does a nice job and the software is well organized.
"I'm really enjoying using this software!  98 pages in on my first feature length script.  It helps that formatting doesn't get in the way of the storytelling.  Really easy to use as well, I have my high school students writing on my laptop and it clicked for them right away."

"I upgraded from Windows 8 due to being deeply dissatisfied with the Calculator app. You could no longer have it open and usable while working in another program. Instead, the Calculator always ran full screen, with gigantic buttons not particularly useful for a non-touch monitor. Maybe there was a way to get it to run as a sidekick to another program that was full screen, but my computer techs didn't know how, and I certainly didn't either. So I upgraded, and Windows 10 seems OK except for the sales pitches. It sounds a tinkly unmusical phrase and then pushes out a slip of text, lower right, telling me to take advantage of the latest iteration of Office. I really dislike Word and would never use it except under duress, and I really hate my own computer trying to sell me stuff I don't want. I've never had cable TV for exactly that reason -- I'm sensitive (OIK, overly sensitive) to advertiser intrusions. Go hawk your junk somewhere else. I've never had an operating system turn on me like that. So, way to go Microsoft. You rectify some of the faults of the much maligned Windows 8, but you can't help yourself, you have to go and find new ways to annoy people."
Received the product very fast and installed easy.  Was a big boost to my old MacBook and now I am able to run newer apps.
"Win 7 Home Premium was installed on my Toshiba Satellite when I bought it.
What they failed to tell me is that you can not stop Microsoft auto-updates from running.
So without any warning the PC will shutdown and reboot.  As it's rebooting there is a notice that an update is being pushed through.
This means I lose time waiting for the reboot and lose anything that was not saved prior to the update!

This is insane. No other systems shut me down without permission or warning.

Why can't Microsoft allow a short warning to allow me to save my work or bookmark my site?  It's so frustrating after spending time identifying a good site to just watch my screen go black.

Home premium has no off switch for this and no delay feature (it's only on Professional).
As a teacher I can't afford to drop another $170 for another operating system when I just bought this one.

I feel that Toshiba and Microsoft has hidden this issue pretty well.

All the reviews on Amazon are just for Windows 7 and do not address issues with Home Premium.

I guess Microsoft figures the only people using Home Premium are housewives surfing for recipes and whatever work they are doing is of no consequence.  I wanted to be a PC but Microsoft treats me like dirt.
Do not buy this product if you are doing anything of any consequence other than surfing for recipes.  You risk losing key work and having to spend time re-doing work that you've spent time on."
"If you wish to pay Microsoft for misery, buy this product."

"I'm pretty floored that National Geographic would put their name on a product of such poor quality.  I have struggled to get this software to work reliably under both Windows XP and MacOS X.  While it does launch sometimes, it frequently crashes.  It is slow and full of bugs.  Map quality is ok.  There are much better products out there.  If you're a Mac user, check out MacGPS Pro.  Night and day difference in terms of application and map quality.

What really blows me away, though, is National Geographic's unwillingness to help paying customers.  Calls to the mapping software division simply go into a voicemail black hole.  It doesn't matter if you select customer service or tech support.  No one ever answers and calls are never returned.  If you're lucky enough to get an email response, you'll wait days, maybe weeks and then it's usually just a boilerplate support message with no real help.  Today, out of sheer frustration, I called the National Geographic Magazine customer service department and spoke with a very nice representative who informed me that he has received multiple calls from frustrated TOPO customers like me and that calls are never returned by the mapping division.  He told me that he himself has tried calling them numerous times and has never received a call back, much less had a person answer the phone.  He told me that there was, essentially, nothing I can do, that the mapping division is known for being indifferent to customer issues, and that I would simply have to wait for an email response if they felt like responding.  Wow.  He then he gave me the main National Geographic Society number in DC to call.  So I called them and explained my situation to the receptionist.  She hung up the phone.

Furthermore, National Geographic's support site is woefully out of date.  The MapXchange service is supposed to update your TOPO maps.  Despite being referenced repeatedly throughout support documents and FAQs, the service is no longer offered.  Instead, National Geographic says that by signing up for AllTrails.com one can receive TOPO updates.  So I did that.  But there are no updates.  It's a joke.

BUYER BEWARE: If you buy any software with the National Geographic name on it, you will receive software that does NOT work reliably, and you will receive NO support and NO assistance from the manufacturer.  This entire experience has so soiled my opinion of National Geographic as an organization that I will NEVER buy anything with their name on it again."
not as good as the past years.  Plus to many versions to chose and still didn't purchase the version I ended up needing.  Not happy  this year.  good chance I move to H & R next year
"Limited in some ways, but at the price it does a good job.  Very good spell checker and dictionary.  Spreadsheet limited in some ways, leaves me wanting."
Im happy that this actually converts text to an mp3 that I can listen to. Its pretty easy to use and does what it says it will do.
Great product.  I have been using it since 1998 and it has not let me down yet.
"In the desktop products, if you are e-filing a state return, there is a $19.99 fee to efile a state return (except free for NY).

If you choose to pay the $19.99 fee out of your Federal refund, then there is an additional $34.99 service fee (for non-California filers) or $39.99 for California filers (In California the optional refund processing service is bundled with Audit Defense and called ""Premium Service"" for $39.99)

If you pay the $19.99 e-file fee upfront with credit card or debit card, however, there is no service fee.

If you want to remove the Premium Service and it's service fee, you need to go through the FILE section again, and remove the refund processing and premium service option, and then choose to pay the TT fees upfront with a credit card or debit card.

I spent almost an hour on the phone to try to get the $40 service charge taken away. TurboTax / Intuit attempted to claim that that the charge was mandatory for the state of California, and that the only way out was if I opted to print and mail the CA Taxes. This was a lie.

The way out is to pay by credit card instead of out of your refund - you avoid the $39.99 service charge and it only charges you $19.99 to e-file the State return.

Intuit / TurboTax is deceitful and untrustworthy. They have lost a lifelong customer."
"Lots of bugs; not much more than a glorified beta release.  Buy now if you must (sync with iPhone app is pretty good), but buy later if you can."
Good  tutoring.  I have version 3 and this 5 is better.
I didn't realize when I bought this that I was actually getting a license for 4 installations. I may have to buy more MACs.
Awesome
"I bought this product to protect an older Windows XP PC (5 years old), and a new 64-bit Windows XP (2002 SP2) laptop.  Installation was flawless on both machines.  I expected to have to download a 64-bit update of BitDefender ""by hand"" from the author's web site, but the software on the CD that I received worked w/o any problems, and without any manual work on my part.  An initial scan ran fine on both machines found a few infected files which I quarantined as directed by BitDefender.  I did not need to invest my time to figure-out how to deal with the errant files.  BitDefender did a nice job.
The only downside I've noticed is that the overall performance of both machines is slower due to BitDefender's monitoring of reading and writing files on the disk.  I like having an easy way to turn this monitoring on and off, but I'd rather get the benefit w/o any slowdown (but this may be just an unreasonable wish)."
makes doing taxes easy... I've tried variable scenarios and the results seem accurate. I'll keep using it. I like it a lot.
"Every 3 years I have to update my Quicken software!  Every 3 years, the software gets a little worse & a lot more expensive. Intuit pretty much has the corner on the home accounting software which is probably part of the problem ... no competition. 2013 did not offer anything so new that it made the upgrade worthwhile.  The ONLY reason I upgrade every 3 years is that you lose the ability to download from your online accounts."
"on the cover it may say that the ages are 5-9 but my kids are 12, 18 and 23 and they all still play it.

"You have to be a little more tech-savvy to use this... some of the menus can take some digging into to figure out how to configure it properly (presuming you wish to do so) but if you just want a standard product, it's extremely easy. Also, it failed to uninstall 360safe so I had to manually do it (that's just another antivirus product)"
"The nice people at Cyberlink sure have it made, you know that? They have us as a captive audience for taking care of our BluRay playback needs, and they do a pretty much bang-up job at it when you analyze this software for content, but they do NOT make it easy on the user when it comes to updating things to the current version, ""Mark II"" with a long post title ""10.1.68.xx. xx. xx"" and on and on and on. First off you have to figure out that there IS an update for the software, and that takes some figuring, trust me it does!

There is so much confusion surrounding what and how to update this software, so many versions of their Cyberlink ""Power DVD"" suite that you really have to have your senses about you when querying the software OR their web site proper on doing an update for this software, Hell's Bells, for any of their software for that matter. I am no neophyte when it comes to updating software but it really is difficult to go about the update process with ANY PowerDVD update, any version, you name it, it's confusing!

There are ""OEM"" versions, there are ""bundled"" versions, there are multiple versions of every single thing that these people make and that is just the start of it, because once you install their software it becomes impossible to figure out which version you actually have, so that is the 1st difficulty. And then/IF you have figured out what version you actually have installed there is a series of hoops that you have to jump through to get to the ""Update"" pages and correctly identify the version that you need to update to...THAT is what I am alluding to in my title of this ""review"" of PowerDVD10 Ultra, which is now called ""PowerDVD 10 Ultra Mark II"" with a 3D thrown in there for good measure, with a long postscript and numerical sequence that follows, depending on what you update it to, that is!

It becomes doubly difficult to navigate on their web site when you figure in that you can become a member of their ""elite clubs"" in various capacities, which involves checking in, signing in, and then that changes the update process that you are going to go through further...so go figure what path you should take I guess, that's the question?! Are you beginning to get my contention in full, because I don't want to confuse anybody about the software as it does work fantastic once you get it installed and updated to the latest version, at least in principle it does, but paleeze Cyberlink, couldn't you make it easier to update, identify the version, and figure out which path you need to be taking when you buy a Retail Copy of the software from Amazon.com!?

I wish it was easy to do any of the above, but it's not, unless you are a telepath, and/or have an inside line to the correct version ""updater"" that you should be using for PowerDVD 10 Ultra ""Mark II"", but it isn't or I wouldn't be writing this confusing review about it, which is really meant to clarify the situation and I am probably doing a lousy job at communicating my frustration with the Cyberlink web site, updating process, and navigation there in general...because it IS miserable at best!

As to the software itself, it seems to work great! I have played ""Avatar"" in BluRay on my PC's screen via my LG Super Multi-Blue HG-GW20L internal BluRay burner/reader/writer without any big difficulty, and I've used PowerDVD 10 Ultra ""Mark II"" software to navigate through the extensive menus on the DVD itself to good measure, digging out the hidden treasures there in terms of content on the BluRay disc, which is danged fantastic once you get going on it and are able to enjoy the BluRay for what it is...which is the best content available in any medium for movies, bar none. I also watched ""Step into Liquid"" which is a surfing BluRay adventure, and it was spectacular, so the software *does work*!

I don't have any problem recommending this package for content and features, because it's darned great at that, it's just the Cyberlink web site, the updating process itself, ie the confusing nature of that process that is soooooo unnecessary that you wonder why in the world they do things the way that they do!? I haven't tried out the ""3D"" feature of this software yet although I intend to do just that soon, and maybe I'll come back here and re-do my review after that is done, who knows?

Two other things about this software that also bothers the heck out of me:

1) It's EXPENSIVE beyond compare at about $100 a copy for the retail version with box and DVD installer

2) There is no alternative, save for Roxio's software and we all know what a nightmare that stuff is!

I guess you could say that I'm a tolerant user of this software, and I have it because there is no other choice, that is probably accurate as all get-out when I self-analyze my purchase and use of Cyberlink's PowerDVD 10 Ultra ""Mark II"" 3D. I wish they had some competition to make the playing field level, but they don't and we're all in the same boat so I can only begrudge my purchase, say it's tainted and somewhat difficult to justify , but then again what else is there? NOTHING, that is what!

Find a hole and fill it, that's what this stuff is, unfortunately, and we all need BluRay playback software if we have a BluRay burner/reader/writer and a good LCD display in our computers, or notebooks... Believe me I am using this software in my high-end Asus G51JX-A1 notebook also, why not? There's nothing else to choose from, so I spread this software around my studio, in my notebook, it's in my PC desktop, it's everywhere I use BluRay content, UNFORTUNATELY!

If there was a word or two I could use to describe the necessity and purchase of Cyberlink's PowerDVD 10 Ultra ""Mark II"" 3D BluRay playback software it's this phrase: ""I bought it because I had to, there was nothing else to consider.""

"Product advertises Blu-Ray support but then after you buy it there is no Blu-Ray support.  You can however buy a $20 plugin for Blu-Ray support but that is an additional cost and the way the product description reads there is no mention the need to buy this extra plugin.

Also there appears to be no telephone support.  If you have any issues with getting it to work or issues with anything including billing, etc. you have to go through there web page support which doesn't appear to have anyone on the other end and no one returns my inquiries.

Product does work on the Mac however.  Not as good as Nero but only solution for the Mac.  I did buy the plugin and Blu-rays burn fine though I was billed twice for the plugin.

I wish there was an alternative seeing as how it's so difficult to contact someone if you need support."
"Then the kindle app is for you. I enjoy having the Kindle app, as it broadens my ability to read and/or own books. I am a constant reader and enjoy many genres of books. Many books are free and many very inexpensive.  My book buying budget is small and as my interests are many the Kindle app is great for me. I am sure you will love it as well."
"That was a great experience to buy the software. It was quickly processed, shipped and with perfect quality. I gave it 5 stars!"

"If you are a cloud user and create files to upload such as important documents this PC app is for you.

"So far, I like this application. I'm new to art programs, and so it's been  slow start learning to use this, I've watched some YouTube vids to get an idea of some of the things I wanted to try out. I like the watercolor brush the best so far. The complaints I've had thus far is that although there are some stencils, there isn't one for a straight up normal circle, and there isn't a way to copy-paste in a basic circle (something I wanted for creating a logo). Again, I'm new at this, but this is something I've also read in online blogs. Even the most simple kids programs allow you to plug in shapes!"
"Terrible on Nexus 5.  It drops out continuously,  whether I am on WiFi or 4g.  Better performance un an Asus TF300t but not by much.  Unusable on an HP Omni 5620.  Does not detect touches to the screen correctly so I can't navigate in the app.  No other app I use behaves this way.  Amazon goes out of it's way to make using the web based player difficult to find, but at least it works adequately.  I am disappointed in the quality of the latest builds of the cloud players."

"DOSN'T WORK, DO NOT BUY"
"My husband and I have been studying various sources in order to learn Spanish for an upcoming trip to Mexico.  Yet, it was not all coming together in a functional way.  So we purchased&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Learn-to-Speak-Spanish-Deluxe-10/dp/B0017NWWUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Learn to Speak Spanish Deluxe 10</a>&nbsp;from Amazon.com.

  This is so much better than the other sources that we could not believe the price.  It has a DVD for computer installation, which also contains a number of movies so that one can get immersed in the language.

  It comes with 3 additional CDs for improving pronunciation.  Each word can be heard, imitated and recorded on the computer with instant feedback as to how one's pronunciation is coming.  Not only is one able to hear pronunciation for sounds and words, but also for the vowels, one can see a moving animation of how the tongue and lips are shaped to make the sounds.

  There are lessons set by the program or one can build her/his own lessons based on need.  A pre-test tells one where he/she needs to start.  There is a Spanish-English /English-Spanish dictionary with all of the Spanish words pronounced with the simple click of the mouse.

  In addition to the 144 page quick reference guide book which comes with the program, there is a 170 page workbook in PDF format with exercises and answers. The workbook is excellent and gives the conjugation of a number of verbs.  There are 40 interactive scenarios in which you speak to the person on the screen in an appropriate conversational way.  The computer picks up your voice and the program gives you immediate feedback.

  Even the games, which are fun, stress pronunciation and record your voice to see if you are saying the words and phrases properly.  (I paid over $100 for a voice recognition program which types.)  This program has a cute little gauge which registers how close you are getting to the proper pronunciation.  It goes from tourist to native.  Of course it has sound that that lets you know how well you are doing in addition to the gauge.

  I could go on but . . . Why?  Well, I will just a little.  The words are listed in such a way that they are related.  You can click on a button and have a drill in which a list of words is said in Spanish with the English meaning on the screen.  You can if you wish, repeat and record to get immediate feedback for accuracy.

  You can download to an MP3 or play the CDs when not at your computer. There is even an internet connection from the site which links you to travel information and time, weather conditions in various countries etc.

  No, I do not work for the company but as an educator myself, I think every subject should have a program similar to this, then the USA would rank in the top five in education again.  This is so much fun that kids could learn without pain and the reward would not only be in high scores earned on the computer but good grades in school as well.  With the added benefit of usable knowledge.

  This is the best $17.95 we have ever spent.  Language courses in high school and college did not make language come alive like this.  Our hats are off to the educators and program designers who developed this excellent learning program at such an affordable price.  Muchas gracias!"
"Today I had my first experience with Windows 8. My uncle purchased a brand new Windows 8 laptop, pretty good quality, a good processor and lots of RAM. Well beyond the minimum specs to run the OS. Here's a rundown of what happened.

1. It runs like crap. Despite the fact that it was a brand new system with solid specs, and barely any software installed or running, the laptop choked and limped along just trying to browse through the files on an external device.

2. The interface is nonsense. Rest in pieces, familiar, logical Windows interface. I couldn't find anything easily or intuitively. Let's put it like this, I'm 21 years old, I grew up with a keyboard under one hand in a mouse under the other, I've used PCs, Macs, Amigas, and Linux machines. I can logic my way around a new program/OS very easily. I couldn't figure out what the heck I was supposed to be doing. I couldn't find anything. I was completely and utterly lost and frustrated.

3. To some extent, this kind of GUI ISN'T MEANT to be used on a computer. It's designed for tablet/phone use, not a laptop or a desktop computer. Microsoft, why would you do this? If you want a tablet/phone OS, sure, develop one. But it feels ridiculous holding my cursor at the edge of the home screen and waiting for the menu to, with great uncertainty, jerk around for a moment and slooooowly scroll to the left or right, an action OBVIOUSLY meant to be performed by swiping my finger across a touch screen. Why, Microsoft? Why can't my computer be a computer?

4. It's glitchy, picky and unintuitive. It just kind of does things, and sometimes, when it doesn't want to do something, it just plain stops without explanation. All I was trying to do was copy some files off an external drive. It kept dumping folders, eating files, randomly switching back to the home screen, and eventually I discovered, after I FINALLY got it to copy all the files correctly, that it had corrupted the first file in each folder. I didn't know what to tell my poor uncle. I still can't figure out what was wrong.

5. It's missing a lot of function, from what I can tell. I couldn't get it to do basic things like use the arrow keys or even page up and page down to scroll. There was a point at which I literally could not delete a file-- it didn't delete when I dragged it to recycle bin, I couldn't use the delete key, there was no delete function in the right-click menu. It was like being in one of those dreams where nothing quite works how it should and you can't walk straight or open doors. Tragically, it was not a dream.

This is a rant-review brought on after spending approximately 45 minutes with this OS today. The thought of having to use this thing on a daily basis is stomach-turning; I'm incredibly lucky to have bought my laptop before Windows 8 took over. Needless to say, I won't ever be using Windows 8 on a machine of my own. Save yourself the trouble, get Windows 7, or literally anything else.

P.S.: It's also ugly as sin. No, Microsoft. Just... no."

"I run a triple boot system...Linux, Windows 7 Ultimate, and now Windows 8 (for over 6 mos).  Windows 8 takes up less space than 7, is faster, at least as stable, and with the price increase is too expensive...however, Microsoft did field an upgrade with this one (but only because they had to or stagnate).  The truth?  I hate it!  But only until I  drop the Metro UI and now boot straight to Desktop.  Then it shines.  IObit, Stardock and others to come have programs that totally skip Metro on the boot for free.  I use IObit ""StartMenu8"", and it's flawless.  Your Start button is back, your old desktop is right there, you can turn off the sidebar/corner activities (or not), and voila, you're looking at the newer/better/faster Windows 7.  And if you haven't yet tried the Metro UI on a Surface Pro tablet, then don't dog Microsoft.  That's what Metro is for, just doesn't belong on MY DESKTOP.  I have an iPad and that will change soon.  I don't like what Windows 8 doesn't have that '95, '98, XP, Vista and 7 DID have, either.  But what it does have and how it does it is better than any Windows yet.  And I'll not get into thoughts on corporate greed. Leave the Mac/Win debates to those dedicated forums...but do think about this:  with Windows if you don't like it, you can mod it..try that on a Mac OS.  I've used both for decades.  I just bought Windows 7 here at Amazon for a new build customer because he hated the Windows 8 Metro UI...don't make that same mistake!  Just use one of the above mentioned programs (or another) and actually upgrade/update your system with Win 8.  Just keep in mind that this system builder software is for a FULL NEW install only, it won't just upgrade and keep files/settings."
"Corel VideoStudio X3 doesn't offer much that you can't already download for free. Its conversion and compression features are terrible (I won't be uninstalling Any Video convertor any time soon). I expected to be able to clean up / sharpen / enhance colours etc. like in Paint Shop Pro X3 but these features are virtually non-existant. (I have since found that the freeware version of vReveal offers all these features). If I could ""un"" purchase this product I would.

I am a big fan of Paint Shop Pro X3, I was expecting VideoStudio to be similar with the same level of features for editing video files but this is not the case."

"I bought this for my son to practice typing. It works great on system 10.9.2. We tried to install it on an older machine (10.3), but it says it needs at least system 10.4 to run.

My seven-year-old son has spent quite a lot of time practicing typing since we've bought this software. He loves it! There is a large variety of games and learning activities. They are well done.

One issue that you may care about but we do not is that this program does not fill the whole screen: the background is blacked out and the program uses a small window in the center of the screen. I personally think this is good, as it's easier to focus on a small area when you're learning."
"I have childhood memories of digging through library archives for genealogy records.  Then I remember my grandmother using early versions of Family Tree Maker to create computerized charts.  Over the years, this product has improved graphics and functionality and has even added access to ancestry.com, but it is the same reliable software that has aided genealogy enthusiasts for years.  This software is your blank slate, and you can turn it into your own family tree."

My company also does an automatic contribution to a 401(a) in addition to the 401(k) match so I'm stuck using work-arounds."
Didn't work on Windows 10
Two in college at the same time made this money saver a no brain er . Easy to install and easy to use .
It's good
Not as good as the original PaintShop Pro
"The product does what it claims,I had no problems installing and confiquring, the ad blocker works like a charm. I have had time to evaluate this firewall since I purchased it in October 2003, and it caused a shutdown issue that forced me to uninstall it. Everything worked great for the first few weeks, the live updates worked perfect, and I thought I had a winner here, but then problems. I mailed Symantec and they explained that my shutdown issue was not known to them, and directed me to downloads.microsoft.com to look for a download to resolve my computer hanging up at the shutdown command. Finally I just uninstalled the firewall, and reinstalled, then everything was fine for several weeks, and then back to problems. I'm running Windows 98SE, and this software won't work on my machine."
not quite sure - computer seems slower when using internet with this on
"A quick look at the first several tutorials had me up and running.  I've been able to do most of the things I've wanted to do with this program and it's delivered on most of its promises.  My wife loves it too.

I have to remind myself that I'm not an architect and this isn't a professional program, though.  It does most things really well but it has some short comings.

I'm trying to draw my house right not which is a 4 level and haven't had any luck yet.  Although I've net seen all tutorials, I'm doubtful the program can do it at all.  Foundations have been difficult to manipulate at best.

My planned home addition includes a home theater and I've had to use work-arounds to get risers and sound insulated walls.  (Which messes up my already difficult to use cost estimator.)  But it has let me put in chairs, speakers, and a projector screen which makes the 3D views very close to what the finished product may look like.

The framing view is a dud as it appears to serve no practicle purpose.

So as long as you have realistic expectations from the program it should make you very happy.  Basic functions are easy to learn and my wife and I've had a blast planning our addition.  I can't imagine designing our addition/remodel without it.

I would buy it again."
did all the updates but would not automatically connect to my financial instituitings.  used it in manual mode for awhile but don't use it anymore..  not piratical and to much time to deal with.
Returned software.  Could not get live help with installation because of problem.
This has always been a useful product for my work as a site analysis consultant.  I supplement it with a number of other sources as it sometimes omits businesses.
"It is missing a few important items. The pictures should be about to be cropped and should be able to change shape such as heart or star shapes.  Second it should have the ability to be exported to other programs to be saved in jpg, png for example.

It does have nice cards, could use more verses and picture frames. For the price not bad.
Love the address book. Couldn't be better. Almost like CreataCard's old one. Love it"
"I received my Norton Internet Security disc a day before expected delivery date.  When I installed it on my first PC, no problems, very user friendly install.  I then proceeded to install it on my 2nd PC, all OK.  Finally, installed it on my laptop, and, once again, it was all good.  So far, all 3 computers are operating smoothly, & I know they're all performing their functions faster than before.  Highly recommend NIS 2012!"
"McAfee is one of the best protection that I have ever used, I bought other protection programs before, but they did not match McAfee. without mention other brand, I bought one of them, in a few minutes form install their program I was hit with serious Virus that forced me to format my computer form scratch."
"I was looking for a payroll solution, after getting this and finding it was good for 1 employee I returned it."
"Worked very well, I had problems initially downloading...... But I got past that and it worked well."
"Every time I try to use the program it wants me to register it, and I have already done so 3 times and still cant use it. Also, you only get a certain amt of activations, so I'm using them up.  It is impossible to get any help from the company.  There is no email option, and the phone line is either not working or just disconnects you.  Useless."
I took full advantage of the refund plus with the amazon gift cards.  that added $400 to my refund!
"I am a Buzz agent and received this product to try out. At first I was reluctant, since my hard drive crashed last year (with a supposedly great product on it) and I lost everything. I must say, I am pleasantly surprised at how well Trend Micro Titanium protects my computer, without slowing things down. Other internet security products that I've tried slowed everything down when it did scans, which became very annoying. Trend Micro doesn't do that. I love the interface (very to use) and seeing the reports. I also love that I can set parental controls. This provides great protection at an affordable price."
Quicken is an easy program to use even for old people like me (80).  It's wonderful for tracking my expenditures.  This way I don't  spend beyond my income.  The new changes in 2016 were good.  I need to have multiple checking accounts.  I wish I could use a color code system for the bill reminder for each account.  Otherwise its great....
I ORDERED THIS SOFTWARE AFTER I HAD ORDERED ANOTHER BRAND OF SOFTWARE THAT PROVED TO BE WAY TOO CONFUSING AND I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT A SIMPLE WAY TO MAKE A CARD!  HOWEVER- THE HALLMARK CARD STUDIO 2011 DELUXE PROGRAM IS EXCELLENT!!!  MAKING A CARD TAKES 3 EASY STEPS!  THE GREAT THING ABOUT THE PROGRAM IS THE FACT THAT YOU CAN ADD SOUND AND CUSTOMIZE IT MANY DIFFERENT WAYS.  YOU CAN EVEN EMAIL THE CARD AS A VIDEO FILE AND SEND AN E-CARD!  I HAVE A LOT OF FUN EVERY TIME I MAKE A CARD AND IT OFFERS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST THE RUN OF THE MILL GREETING CARD PROGRAMS. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PROGRAM.  WELL WORTH THE PRICE!  THANK YOU HALLMARK.  JOB WELL DONE!!!
supposed to be good
"While the package says it is for Win 95/98, it does install and run under NT 4.0 (saying its NT 3.0 and I might have problems with NT) on my Dell 7500 laptop.  The installer does want you to change to 256 color mode, but runs okay in 65,536 (16-bit) color mode.
My 8 year old son loves this program."
We used Autoroute in Amsterdam for 3 days. Using the Microsoft GPS Antenna supplied with Streets and Trips 2008. AutoRoute Europe was the worst package I have ever worked with and was continuously slow to warn about turns and frequently planned turns the wrong way on one way streets. It was enough to convince me to by a TomTom GPS for the car and what a difference. The TomTom is an excellent product and will certainly leave you much less frustrated.
"Lots of false positives for items as mundane and frequently used as updates to Firefox and updates to Google Chrome. Updating programs that you use everyday still requires disabling Avast. Avast will prompt a popup box that says it will add an exception, but however many times you add an exception by using the popup or by manually entering the path, Avast finds something to worry about.

On the plus side, Avast is decent at automatically updating itself."
Good software can download data from my banks.  Tracking all my expenditure and banking transactions.  Automatically prompt of any issue comes up like account payable or exist the amount.
OK software
"I read the reviews and saw the difficulties that folks were having with the install, so I was prepared for a battle. ;-)
First sure make sure you're logged in as admin
Turn off Anti Virus as much as possible
You will need to know if you have a 32 bit or a 64 bit machine
You will need to have and Adobe user account - Go to Adobe.com and create one, they are free. Do it before you start.
Be able to get to your product keys, you will need them
All file locations given are the default locations the applications use
Here we go...
Download installer; at the end of download select open folder;
find Adobe_Photoshop_Elements_Premiere_Elements_14_Downloader right click and select run as administrator (this will create a file on your desktop named Adobe Photoshop Elements & Premiere Elements 14 (Download).
After the download completes the installer will run - IT DOESN'T WORK,  don't bother, just close it (I believe this is were the problem lies)
Open the Adobe Photoshop Elements & Premiere Elements 14 (Download).on your desktop and then select the folder inside of that named
PhotoshopElementsAndPremierElements14.
I have a 64 bit machine so, I right clicked the named PhotoshopElements_14_LS28_win64.exe and selected run as administrator Select open file once it finished. (This will extract the files to C:\Users\blah\Desktop\Adobe Photoshop Elements 14)
Inside Adobe Photoshop Elements 14 folder there are two folders, PSE14 and Readme,
Select PSE14, inside the folder right click on Set-up and choose run as administrator.  (the installer gave me a message to restart my PC at this point. I don't know if that was just specific to my machine), now you just follow the prompts on the install.)
I would restart after each app finished installing.  The premiere install is the same as photoshop.
I hope this helps someone.
Good luck
I'll have to come back and rate the software as I haven't used it yet.  I just wanted to help people get it installed."
"I have Magix Movie Edit Pro 17 and PowerDirector 10, so I will make some comparisons.  Powerdirector is obviously designed to make things easy.  In the process it sacrifices a lot of flexibility.  I am interested in 3D so I looked mainly at the 3D features.  Various other reviewers have commented that it can edit Fuji 3D AVI files which contain interleaved L & R images.  But when I tried to load a 3D AVI, it did not recognize it.  This seems to be a mysterious problem unique to my computer and may not bother others.  I found that PD10 allows the video to be loaded, but it does not recognize it as a 3D video.  Magix by contrast loaded virtually any video I threw at it with correct decoding.

It has crashed several times in the first 2 days I tried it.  But Magix is also known to crash frequently, and I have had other video programs also be unstable.

It does seem to to support MP4 interleaved 3D just fine while Magix did not.  But it does not have any way to decode over/under vertically squashed 3D, or 2X horizontally squashed side by side 3D.  Curiously it allows the user to output 2X horizontally compressed 3D.  When 3D is enabled you can not output an AVI which means that it can not output a Fuji compatible 3D avi.

There is no option to output 3D to an active monitor, but it does support passive monitors and anaglyph.  If you view a 3D picture or video on an FPR passive monitor PD does not properly sync the output with the physical lines.  If you move the viewing window up or down one scan line the L and R images are reversed.  This swaps the image from true stereo to pseudoscopic stereo.  Pseudoscopic 3D images reverses the depth of the background and foregroud which makes them look strange, sort of like an indented bass relief.

The printed manual lacks an index which makes it fairly useless.  Again Magix has an index.  Ok, so there is a pdf of the manual, but when I searched on codec I came up with nothing.  Also why do the manufacturers have to be cagy about which codecs are supported?  PD does not seem to recognize installed codecs for output, but does recognize them for input.  So it is possible to input a file in a lossless compressed format such as Huffy, but not possible to output it in the same format.  Indeed the manufacturers also do not give much in the way of details about what has been fixed and what features are actually available.  So when you try to load a file when the codec is missing PD tells you to get another file, rather than helping you by suggesting there is a missing codec and directing you to where you might find it.

WARNING: The 64 bit version is automatically installed on 64 bit systems and you do not have the option of installing the 32bit version.  This means you may have get new codecs for various video files you already have.  During this transitional period it would be best if you could select both versions.  That way you can use the speed of 64bit or the existing codecs for the 32bit.

After some more work with PD 10, I found that it had a problem with producing good resolution DVDs.  If you select HD it maintains the 720x480 NTSC resolution, but Standard or LP cut it to 352x480.  In HD mode you can only burn up to 1 hour on a standard DVD.  The newer version PD 11 fixes this problem by having a separate check box to tailor the bitrate to the disc size so PD can burn good resolution 2hr discs just like the professional discs.  Also the old version ignores the current resolution and bitrate of your source even if it is MPGII, and always re-encodes the video.  The new version seems to directly copy MPG videos which makes PD faster and preserves the full resolution of the original.  Of course it won't do this if you have filtered the video in any fashion.  This is a feature which has long been available on the Magix product so they are catching up with version 11.  But Magix does not have the closed captioning subtitle feature which is available in PD.

In all fairness Magix is trying to attract the semi-pro with their product while PD is aiming it squarely at the average consumer.  But overall Magix has much better 3D support and PD should have supported the Fuji format because it is a major format from the only decent 3D consumer digital camera.  So far their support dept. can not figure out why my computer has problems with 3D input.  Most 3D cameras have the lenses too close together or output anaglyph which makes them toys rather than real 3D cameras.  Also part of the problem is that PD has gone to 64bit while a lot of the existing codecs are only 32bit."
"As echoed by the most critical reviewer.  I too, continue to be plagued by missing media files, incomplete syncs, trees continually having to be removed and re-added to the ancestry.com site. I am running with the most current updates: 21.2.6.

The sync feature is a GREAT idea in theory, however, it rarely ever works correctly. Instead, you are left with missing media files that you must now manually re-link, missing data etc. I have spent more time doing repair and data entry than I care to count. I've resorted to searching for documents through my online ancestry account and saving the images in files on my desktop, since I can no longer trust that once ""synced"" the image will be available for future reference.

Mind you, I've been a FTM user since it's inception.  This program is definetly money and time wasted and continues to be a huge disappointment."
"Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac was purchased as an upgrade. I work as an editor and publisher of niche publications and it is necessary for me to have recent versions of software to serve my clients.

That said, this is the slowest, most memory-sucking MS Office yet. The performance on a G5 2.0 Dual GHz Mac running Mac OS 10.5.5 is abysmal. On my Intel Mac Dual Core 2.0 GHz MacBook Pro, the performance is only slightly better.

I suspect the primary reason for the slow boot-up time is that (as a publishing professional) each machine has more than 100 fonts open at any given time. MS Word does not handle large font libraries very well.

My recommendation is to avoid this program if you can. The Text Editor that is part of Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard) is far more nimble and allows documents to be saved as any number of MS Word version documents. It is a better bet for casual Mac users.

PowerPoint is only useful to view PowerPoint documents. I seldom need this function. I do not use MS Messaging or Ms Entourage (Mac Mail is better integrated with my iPhone).

I use MS Excel from time to time. Again, it is slow starting up, but functions well beyond that.

The bottom line is that I own MS Office 2008 for Mac because I have to, not because I want to."
"Have used the Deluxe for years and no problems.
However, this year forms I use such as Schedule F and depreciation are not available in this version.
No mention of this major change in any of the descriptions or capabilities.
Called TurboTax and they setup a download to get the home & business version.
So all is well on the farm."
Does not work on Windows Phones.
"Loading the program never got any farther than entering your name to start playing. As soon as we entered a name and clicked ""Start"" it went back to desktop screen. We tried various ways to make it work but it always quit and went back to the desktop screen. We returned the software."
"Works for our 5 computers!  Never had a computer hacked since 2009, and I travel the world on business (my fellow workers lost 8 different computers to hackers in Europe, Asia, Middle East and Canada).  My 90-year-old father-in-law at home wanders onto all kinds of different websites and tries things he shouldn't, with a very old desktop computer.  He's had no hacks in 6 years with ESET on board."
"I really like the speed with which Windows 7 starts up, shuts down, and does everything in between. This is the best Windows OS I've used so far. Installed on a laptop that used to run Vista. What can I say? The differences are so great, there is no comparison. If anyone is still using Vista, I strongly urge them to switch to Windows 7. Go ahead, give it a try. You will not regret it. Like so many people said before: ""Windows 7 is what Vista should have been!"""
"Love this, plays the music and in a lot of cases shows the lyrics of the song, fun."
"I've been using Kaspersky Internet Security for over five years.  The price is reasonable and the program has done an excellent job of keeping my system free of infectious problems.  Keep up the good work, Kaspersky!"
The new 2016 for Mac I've found to be much faster and user-friendly than previous versions. They've fixed many little irritants in previous versions and added several time-saving steps. Reconciling is now much faster.
"The old version with no ""Numbers"" but the Pages and Keynote are fine and these do incorporate some of the functions of numbers. Had to transfer the disc to flash drive using a windows machine to load it on some old non CD G4s. Have not used this version much at all. I do like the templates for these Macs better than the ones provide with MS office or even Publisher."
Thank you for making this easy.
"It seems apple has launched their own office software,
but I'm still a big fan of microsoft office,and I feel great it has mac version.
hopefully,microsoft can make mac version of project and visio as well, that'll be very helpful."
Scam! Tried to renew my License on a new computer and they tried charging me $250 to clear 'bugs' in my PC. A complete scam.
"Every version of Nero I have ever used does this unbelievably stupid thing:
If  you use multisession (this allows you to burn additional files onto a CD or DVD many times until you fill it.), the second time and thereafter that you burn additional files onto it, Nero will again in addition reburn every previously burned file as another copy. That is about the DUMBEST F'ING THING I HAVE EVER SEEN. HAD I WANTED TO BURN A SECOND COPY OF EVERY DAMN FILE ALREADY THERE, I WOULD HAVE SELECTED IT MYSELF. WHAT IN HELL IS THE MATTER WITH THESE MORONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Works fine
"So far, we don't need an accountant.  TurboTax asks every question you can imagine, and then some.  If you have the numbers, TurboTax does the rest.  If your financial life is not very involved, this is right for you.  Plus, e-filing is great when you are receiving a refund."
A better price than from the Turbo.  Thanks.  Worked perfectly well.
"ok, I was expecting it to work better, but it's free..."
This is a good solid replacment case. It works and fits exactly. FYI you need special tools to put this on your phone you could buy them at your local Fry's Electronics or specialty shop or on this site.

"Office 2001 is a great product. You can do anything with Office 2001 that you can do with v. X, just on the much more elegant Classic Mac OS. In fact, the Office 2004 interface that everyone loves is based on this version, just with an Aqua appearance update and some subtle refinements.

Office 2001 may be somewhat annoying as regards the Office Assistant, but Office 98 featured it too and it wasn't compatible with G4 Macs with 9.1 and later from the factory, of which I'm using it on a Quicksilver Power Mac G4 as the Office version for 9, where it's the only Office version that will work.

I do love Office 2001, but then again that's because Office 2008 made Excel unusable-and I'm not just talking about Visual Basic for Applications, I'm talking about the default half-toolbar, half-ribbon UI that Microsoft pasted onto Excel 2008.

If I am going to use a ribbon, I will use a Windows 7 PC with a ribbon-bearing version of Office. If I want traditional toolbars, I want traditional toolbars-and both Office 2001 for Mac OS 9.1 and Office 2004 for Mac OS X 10.3.9 (both loaded on the same computer) provide that. That's really nice, at least compared to forced Office 2011 ribbon and activation hassles.

I love Office 2001, although that love comes from a very uncommon person who wanted last generation Classic Mac OS hardware."

"This is a very good program. You can set it to go from any city to another city. You get update for construction often, so it very up-to-date. I would recommend this program for anyone who likes to travel in the United States."
"I tried this product at work for a while. Fortunately I didn't have to pay for it. I found the open source PDFCreator to be superior. You can download PDFCreator for free from SourceForge. PDFCreator just installs like a printer, so you can create PDFs from any application that supports printing. I've never had a problem with it."
"A picture tells a thousand words! This is especially true if you're learning about some photo management software like Photoshop Lightroom. If you are new to Photoshop Lightroom 3 (and even if you've been using Lightroom 2), you will find that the authors thoroughly cover all the features of Lightroom 3.

This tutorial literally holds your hand as you learn to use Lightroom 3. The videos are HD-quality and crystal clear. You can maximize or watch it full-screen, or you can watch it in a smaller window so you practice what you're learning at the same time.

No wonder this is ""Adobe-approved"" training by experienced Adobe-certified instructors. Highly recommended for anyone who wants sit back, relax and let the instructors teach them Photoshop Lightroom 3 as opposed to reading a book that can get boring after a few chapters."
"I like the product. But Norton Antivirus, Symantec did not except my rebate offer and indicated my original receipt which was an Amazon receipt was not valid. I will not purchase from Symantec again."
Product was new in box as advertised. Shipping was prompt and price was the best around. I would shop with Amazon again.
I've used QuickBooks since their first edition came out. Have always been please with them. Very smart design.
"Finally, there is another Zoombinis game.  It took about five years, but I was so excited that I immediately rushed out and bought it.  I was a little disappointed to see that the graphics had changed, so that all of the Zoombinis looked different.  As soon as I started to play it, however, I changed my mind.  Though it only has nine puzzles and three difficulty levels for each, the game is still challenging.  The Zoombinis are living in Zoombiniville happily, until a storm makes some Zoombinis get trapped in a cave.  They venture out to rescue the others, and find that the friendly Boolies have lost their mayor.  Now, the Zoombinis decide to help the Boolies get back to Booliewood so that their mayor will return.  Instead of the difficulty level rising for an entire leg, each level can now have its own setting.  Once a group of 16 Zoombinis gets through a level any three times without losing any Zoombinis, the difficulty level rises.  Math and logic are slyly disguised and placed in each level, without using numbers.  Some of the new concepts include dimension labeling and binary addition.  This long-awaited sequel to the first Zoombinis game is almost as good as Logical Journey, though I would rather have the first if I had to choose.  If you like this game, try the original, Zoombinis Logical Journey, and the third, Zoombinis Island Odyssey."
This game is a very challenging game but very fun nd thrilling. Everything from ziplining to agent high tech stuff. Highly interactive!

"First off, I would comment that if your computer is not current you may be more frustrated than anything else.  I am running an AMD Athlon 1600+, 512MB of 266DDR RAM, and just bought a new 3D video card (MSI GeForce 440MX 128MB DDR) specifically for this application.  I am amazed at how fast the 3D rendering is processed and how easily I can build a basic house.
 The one point I am having some trouble with is in using the landscape elevation tool. (I haven't looked at the manual yet other than for the initial installation.)  I have tried other 3D CAD programs on an older system with a basic video card and the experience was dreadful!  I believe that with a little more practice and even looking to the manual I will be able to do most anything within the products limits..."
"I am a first-time buyer of Quicken. I find the user interface extremely counterintuitive. The first thing I tried was entering a mortgage I've had for a several years (i.e. made payments on in the past). I tried for about 2 hours to get Quicken to generate the past payment transaction history based on the standard loan inputs (i.e. origination date, loan amount, interest rate, etc.) - to no avail. Finally I gave up on figuring it out myself and went online to use the Intuit Chat help. They responded to my chat request immediately, but it took another 3 hours to have them work me through the steps! What a nightmare, half a day wasted just to create one simple mortgage account! Bye-bye Intuit, I already downloaded the trial version of MS Money..."
"I swear, nothing in my life has upset me as much as this software. It take 20 minutes to install, and then it slows down your computer tremendously! It makes my computer work like a MS-DOS PC. It doesn't protect you at all! Worst of all, it won't update. It did the same update about 37 times for me before I uninstalled. It had a pop-up every 20 seconds and the software is the ugliest thing in the world. If you buy this, I would say you will be miserable for at least a week. I am..."

"Like many other reviewers, I have used many project making software packages over the years. With how expensive greeting cards are these days, it normally pays for its self very quickly plus allows you to really make it personal to the person receiving the card--plus you get to make flyers, banners, etc for free.

No brand seems to ever really stack up against the PrintMaster package. The quality of the software, clip art, fonts, etc are the best you will find. I have used 5-6 versions of PrintMaster and loved them all UNTIL this ""upgrade"". I am not sure if they sold themselves to another company or just fired everyone responsible for making the good parts of the software but this has been redesigned from the ground up to be just plain crappy. It is slow, buggy, hard to use and full of disappointment. Honestly I wish I could find something I like better than PrintMaster Platinum 18 but there is nothing better and a LOT that is much, much worse.

Comparing the two products, this PrintMaster Platinum 2.0 has an average review rating of about 1.5 stars and this is with a ton of Vine reviews--where Amazon & the software company provides free software in exchange for reviews. The Vine reviews tend to be more positive since the person didn't pay anything for the product and because the reviewer feels guilty leaving poor reviews since they were asked by the company to do them. In this case, 7 out of the 9 four star reviews were from vine users and 8 out of the 9 three star reviews were from vine users as well. Removing those ""purchased"" ratings, the overall user rating would easily drop to 1 star--the lowest possible rating on Amazon.

Whereas, PrintMaster Platinum 18 is currently ranked at 3.5 stars by customers. It is faster, has better templates, better clip art and is better in every way. It is currently even cheaper than this version, but it has been discontinued so you need to grab it before it disappears leaving you with this crappy program as your only option.

"I gave this program to my friend for Christmas. Both of us have enjoyed giving readings for friends and family members. It allows you to save names, reading histories, and reports for future reference, or in case anyone wants to see their reading again later. The cards are beautifully illustrated, and the meaning of the card placement in the spread and the card itself is well-explained. It has options for shuffling the deck with or without reversed cards. I prefer the Ryder-Waite deck over the Cyber deck, although the Cyber one was interesting for a change. (i.e. Adolf Hitler was the Devil card.) All in all, a great piece of software. You won't regret it if you decide to get it."
Everything as expected.
"Absolutely terrible performance on Windows 8.1.  I have used Quicken for years and had to update from Quicken 2012, but although Quicken 2015 appears similar, it has two major flaws. First, it requires that you get an intuit online account (why?), but it's not clear why this is required or beneficial to me. I want my finances on my own computer, which I why I'm using Quicken desktop and not Mint or whatever  Second, the performance of the bank updates is constantly crashing my version of Quicken. I don't even see a menu option for downloading Quicken updates (bug fixes), but the issues I'm seeing are causing me to almost abandon the platform. I used standard banks and can log into the websites and passwords and connections which have long worked now do not, and the system just spins and spins until I use the task manager to force quit the application. It's a huge pain."
"First: Product is pricey. Avoid it unless you absolutely need it.

Second: Bad interoperability between Mac and Windows versions. If you use the grab utility to copy/paste screenshots into Word, etc. and expect the document you created to open on a PC, better have Quicktime and TIFF decompressor. (Who had that bright idea?)

Third: Virtual PC DOES NOT WORK on Intel Macs. Best platform is PPC G4/G5. It's a CPU hog on G3, even if you max out your RAM.

Fourth: Here's the kicker. Better get a hold of software like Font Doctor and make sure you're running OS X 10.4+. Corrupt fonts will cause Office apps to crash and burn. Recommend removing all fonts except OS-provided fonts, run font doctor and repair all fixable fonts, then use the Font Book supplied by OS X Tiger (10.4) to bring them back in. Don't forget to reboot between removing fonts and re-adding them. You'll save a world of trouble in doing this."
"This product has serious problems.  I was able to back up my whole hard drive but not just the data on the drive.  In attempting to do so, the program consistently shut down.  It also caused Internet Explorer to shut down intermittently.

Technical support is only via e-mail (unless you want to pay)and there is a long delay in obtaining a response.  When I was finally able to contact technical support, they provided out-dated hyperlinks to various ""solutions.""  Further contact with technical support resulted in the suggestion that I uninstall all Symantec products.

I'm a relatively experienced computer user, but I have never encountered a product that was so entirely defective right out of the box and that has such poor technical suport.

Beware of this product."
"I have used Norton's Antivirus and firewall products before with great success.  However, installing this product broke socket connections within Windows XP leaving me without network connections.  Norton's support line offered no assistance with the problem and they sent me to Comcast, who also offered no assistance.  After working on this problem for 7 hours, I found a utility on a bulletin board which restored the sockets.  The problem resulted from removing older versions of anti-spyware and antivirus products.

Because of the support experience, I will never buy another Norton product."
"have been using kaspersky for 3 year, no complaisant, actually have saved me a couple of time.
i love the save money and virtual keyboard features"
Norton is Highly ranked for protecting the security of your computer system. With this particular choice you can use it for multiple computers
"UPDATE 1/24/09:

I am still very satisfied with this product.  So far I've entered all my data, and it's been pretty painless, both for Fed & State taxes.

I have to qualify this by saying that my taxes are pretty simple this year, with no AMT, no sch C, no sch K, etc.  So I'm not really running into some areas that are often not handled well in tax software.

One thing I liked better than turbo tax was the simpler handling of tax-exempt income, splitting the in-state vs. out-of-state portions.  Also, similarly, the handling of US Treasury interest (tax-exempt for state tax).  Turbo Tax makes you enter separate 1099s for each part, instead of just capturing the information within one form dialog.

On the other side, I have some additional critiques:
(1) no ability to import/download W2 & 1099 data (not that I found, anyway)
(2) form 1116 has to be filled out manually, even if it's pretty straightforward -- they could have and should have provided an interview for this
(3) no way provided to simply delete a line in a form (minor point, turbo tax has this, and I find it very useful) -- you can of course delete the data in the line

INITIAL REPORT:

Obviously, it's a bit too early to provide a thorough review of the program, because it's essentially incomplete (as is TurboTax): many tax forms are still not available in their final form.  There will be a Dec 11 update, and I expect several others over the next couple of months.  (I've learned from past experience not to submit final returns until late March, since the bug fixes and form corrections are often not final until then.  This is true for either TurboTax or TaxCut.)

However, here's my current take: this is a fine program, and certainly more than adequate for the necessary help preparing a tax return.  I've used TaxCut in the past, but have used TurboTax for the past few years.  I decided to use TaxCut this year because of the price difference, and because the new licensing policy for TT is annoying.  So far I'm finding it easy to use, and trouble-free in importing data from the previous year TurboTax file and current year TXF files.

One minor weakness compared to TurboTax: I remember that in the 07 TT you could remove a specific set of imported data; I haven't found anything like that in this program.  Not a biggie for me, since I always save ""checkpoints"" in separate files so I can revert to a previous version if I need to, but it's the kind of little thing that makes TT a bit better in my opinion. Just not sufficiently better that I will pay anything Intuit wants to charge (just a matter of principle for me).

Some general comments, based on experience over many years of doing my own (often very complicated) returns:  Neither program is perfect by any means.  For many complicated situations you have to do your own calculations externally (I use Excel), or enter data manually.  Be aware that dealing with AMT, AMT credits, and stuff like that remains mind-bendingly difficult, just not as nightmarish as doing them without a program to help.  And you should always sanity check your results, because odd calculation bugs can persist for a long time.  (I found a very stupid, but hard to find, calculation bug in TurboTax a few years ago, having to do with AMT.)

I will post an update in a few weeks when I've had the chance to make more progress with my return.  Will be able to review the state program as well at that point, perhaps."
"This product did what I needed.  My new computer came with Windows 8 but no MS Office. Most MS Office packages that include Outlook are quite expensive so this key card took care of that problem.  The only complaint I have is that MS Outlook is slow at first when I open it.  It will say ""not responding"", and I know that's b/c it's trying to download all the emails I received since I last opened it (or last pulled my computer out of hibernation mode).  I just don't recall having that issue with my previous MS Outlook, so I'm a little disappointed. On the other hand, it was very easy to import all my contacts and emails from my previous Outlook and the Office did not crash with the new operating system."
I have had it for four years and never had a virus!!!
"This has been a favorite game of the little Leep Pad user in my home. Its got several different Disney stories to interact with, and my daughter has been learning so much from it without even realizing it. I only wish there was more content and more badges for her to earn within the game. Shes completely finished every game on this cartridge and earned all of the accolades possible."
AVAST.....
I recently got a mac and was distraught because all my files are in word or excel from my pc. Then I bought this product and can open and use all my files on the mac. The learning of the new software is not that bad either. I will never go back to pc.
Easy to dowmload
"Streets and Trips with the GPS gives much more information than small portable GPS units but the complexity requires it be turned over to a passanger use it safely. To reward the passanger/navagator they can watch a DVD during those long interstate streches, while streets and trips runs in the background."
"BOught this to add onto my Garmin hand held GPS, and it goes into detail as a true street navigator. You can look up and mark any address you want now and put it in your GPS to help you along the way."
I love H&R Block software.  I do get the disc in case there is a problem with the download.  It covers my personal taxes and also is enough for a small business I own.  I would highly recommend this software if you do your own taxes
"The program can appear somewhat obtuse at first with all the accountant's jargon. However, with patience and a willingness to learn a little the program provides an easy to follow process to completion. There is great error checking so the final return that goes to the IRS is complete. With regard to contacting H&R Block via online chat or telephone the wait is so long it does not seem worth the effort.  Doing a Google search for answers is generally better especially since you learn a lot. For next year H&R Block could benefit in having a sample of ordinary tax payers use the program and identify the areas that they might find confusing. Armed with this information H&R Block could provide a more comprehensive Help Section."
My son loves to draw and this is the software that goes with his sketchbook. He uses it often and allows him to get very intricate with his sketches on his computer.
Having used paint shop pro since version 2 I have always had it at the top of my list for working with photos and graphics. It is great for someone that does have the dollars for photoshop but want a comp program.
"Avast!! I love it!!! I have used many of the popular antivirus', both the ""have to pay for versions"" as well as the top free ones. They all let something through. I have never had anything get through Avast!! I have never felt more secure. And the cost is half of what I used to pay for the big names. I have it on both my computers. Both my desktop at the office and my laptop. This is my second year virus free. Finally we have the protection we need at a great price. You want protection? You need Avast!!"
I have this on my phone and my tablet. Both work great for me.
Open office is what it is. It functions if you do not have access to anything else.
"I just received this product yesterday and spent last evening trying to get it to work properly.  My purpose for using this software is primarily to create slide shows of JPEG images that are self-running on CD-Rom.  Creating music CDs is secondary to me at this point.  Before I purchased the software, I read a good number of the reviews posted here, so I was forewarned.
Well, the other reviewers weren't lying.  I had a lot of difficulty trying to get my images burned on a CD and then to create a slide show with Photo Relay.  My PC crashed 3 times in the process. There were not any step-by-step instructions on how create the photo album and slide show in the documentation.  I was referred to the Roxio website - which kept freezing up on me. There also did not seem to be a way to specify that I wanted to create the album/slide show on the CD rather than on one of my hard drives.
In the end, I was able to jury-rig a way to do what I wanted by using DirectCD (included in the software). Once I treated my CD burner as another drive, I was able to transfer the files and create the album/slide show.
I tested the resulting CD on my office computer to see if the slide show would run on its own and it worked fine.
I am now trying to figure out how to do this the ""correct"" way using PhotoRelay without Direct CD.
Since this is the only software I have been able to find that allows me to create the kind of slide shows I want, it looks like I am stuck with it.
Good luck future buyers!"
Family Tree Maker 2011 Essentials was very helpful.  I have been keeping track of my family tree for years and I never fail to update my programs and this one is very good.
"Have used TurboTax for years and have always been very happy--until this year.  I do taxes for several family members and have always used the Deluxe version.  This year, after purchasing Deluxe and installing it, I learned that I would need Premier in order to do my mother-in-law's taxes.  I have not had to do her taxes before.  I was told I could get a $25 refund if I had used Deluxe version last year, but needed Premier this year.  I paid $20 more just to get a couple of schdules that have always been included on Deluxe.  I didn't qualify for the $25 refund because I didn't file our own taxes, even though I still purchased and used both versions.  Our personal taxes involved special circumstances I didn't feel qualified to tackle.  Very unhappy with TurboTax this year!!!"
could not get it to work with our computer and it doesn't come with instructions. so disappointed especially since it was a birthday present for my daughter. we are out $100 and she is short a present!!!!
"NIS 2007 is vista compatible, & it works good-as-ever, just like the 1 that came before it (2006 nis). I would definitely recommend it."
awesome
"Install fails to complete, as well as other users cannot even download.  Frustrating."
"I got this for a friend, I would never buy Bitcoin, he thinks it's okay I guess."
"If Microsoft and Apple are going to force us to buy Word, can't they at least make the program work without being so damn buggy? Word's persistently bossy auto-formating and general kloodgy bugginess has been going on for years and years -- why is this still the case?? These people are making gazillions of dollars off this stuff, so why can't they get the basics right and stop driving customers batty?

Also, this version has too many bells and whistles. If you just want a simple word processing program, the rest of Word's shiny goo-gaws can be really irritating. It should be much easier for users to turn off any unwanted features -- software engineers may be in love with their own designs, but that doesn't mean the average user will be, too."
Just awesome!!
"This year I purchased both Turbo Tax Deluxe and H&R Tax Deluxe as I wanted to see if I would get a better return with one vs another.  I ensured both had the same values.  1040 with a Sch C (thus personal and small business)

Found a big gap...
H & R Block 2013 (version 5801)
Any entries from a 1099-DIV Item 6 - Foreign Tax Paid will not make it to the Sch A form.  Because of this I would pay more taxes as I didn't get to deduct this amount - You can manually add the entry on your Sch A.  TurboTax did move this amount into Sch A line 8 as ""Foreign Taxes Int Div"".  H & R for years made me go through the process of filling out and additional form which seems to be unnecessary. I manual created an entry in the Sch A to create a match.

Found a small gap...
H&R will round every entry.  I believe this is the reason for a difference of $5 in the amounts between TurboTax and H&R Block, with TurboTax providing the better result.

Since I wanted to see which provided the best return (or less due) it appeared H&R may be impacted on all returns due to aggressive rounding and possibly major impacts."
What a way to play the music of your life.
"I have been using this program for many years.  Always satisfied.
I have never had an audit using Turbo Tax.
Highly recommended."
Would not work
"Not the friendliest program to use for someone who has never used Quickbooks before.  I bought this because it said that I would have a help anytime I needed it for one year.  But when I called, I was told that that was not true and I needed to purchase something else in order to get the help I needed.  Sad to think that people would advertise something they didn't offer."
"i have used quicken since 1996. Changing software now would be a pain with all the history i have. But, as with ALL other upgrades i have issues that i have spent hours fixing. One of which i cannot get fixed even after spending 3 hours, in 2 sessions, with ""chat"" support. All i got from support was someone in India that really did not understand my issue. The issue i cannot fix is that my primary credit card we use for virtually all purchases to get rewards will not auto sync any longer. Now i have to manually go to bank website each time and get the download.

Also, i tried the mobile app, again this year, and it has failed miserably, again.

Someone at Intuit needs to get to moving fixing old versions, and getting new versions fully functional before launching.

As mentioned, i have been using quicken a long time and changing will be a pain, but i am looking........."
"I have used the business program for years with no problems, but this years version is terrible!!
I had the same out-of- sync display problem discussed by others. In my case, customer support had me lower the display font size to small and lower the resolution. It worked, but it means everytime I need to use this program, I have to reconfigure my computer, and when finished- change it back so I can run everything else!!
I am not a computer programmer, but this seems an elementary programming mistake that should have been fixed immediately."
This product is easy to install and easy to use. I have been using TurboTax for over ten year and found this to be the easiest yet.
"easy to install, affordable"
It wasn't what I thought I needed
"OK, third try here. It worked -- at the right price with the Amazon Prime Discount and the Intuit refund. I've always preferred TurboTax to the other offerings. We will see how it works out next year."
"Funny movie, don't get why people rate it lower. If you've seen the original you'd realize the original was bad. This one they just remade it and made fun of it and did a great job!"
"The response time from running via the CD is incredible slow. To fix it follow these instructions received from the manufacturer.  Worked GREAT for me:

On Macintosh, you can easily create disk images (.dmg files)

out of the CDs using the ""Disk Utility"" program found in the ""Utilities""

folder inside the ""Applications"" folder. Using disk images, the game

will run entirely off the computer hard disk.

Below are the steps to create a disk image on Macintosh. Note that if

you need help with this procedure, we can assist you over the phone.

1. Insert the game CD in your Macintosh.

A CD icon appears on your Desktop.

2. Double-click on the ""Disk Utility"" icon found inside the ""Utilities""

folder under ""Applications"".

The Disk Utility window appears on the screen.

3. Click on ""Session 1"" item on the left-side pane.

The Session 1 of the game CD is highlighted.

4. Click on the ""New Image"" icon in the toolbar at the top of the

application window.

A dialogue window appears on the screen.

5. Set the ""Image Format"" to ""Read only"" for optimal performance and

save the image on your Desktop or any convenient location of your choosing.

The Disk Utility program writes the .dmg file. When the process is

complete, you can close the Disk Utility program. If the process fails,

then it probably means that your copy of the disk is not fully readable.

You can now double-click on the .dmg file to fake the insertion of the CD."
It was easy to download and install. Did not have any difficulty to read books from my library.
"very powerful tool that will do just about anything you need to develop a great website. I looked at multiple other products and decided on this one as it had 98% of what I was looking for but was priced at a fraction of other tools on the market.  I was up and running in about 24 hours using it, do take the time to review instructions and tutorials vs just launching it though. Its important to understand the big picture of your site and not just start developing pages first.  Its probably one of the easiest tools to learn without having to take a course somewhere too."
This app works perfectly and coordinates quite well with my other devices. I am very pleased with it.
My granddaughters love it
"My parent is a long time ACT! 2000 user, the upgrade to the ACT! 2009 Premium Edition seems to be a nightmare, in terms of program startup/running speed and stability.

Let me give you cuple example after just a few minutes of using and testing.

He have about 3000 contacts and thousands of groups in his old ACT! 2000 program database, and couple thousand to-do lists.

After conversion of the old 2000 database to the new 2009, the database size has increased about 10 times from 15MB to about 60MB with no new contents added.

The program with the Microsoft SQL express server is running hell slow on a Duo Core 2.0 GHZ machine with 2 GB of memory.

Changing a layout of the program (back and forth from only 2 option available, whcih is 800x600 or 1024x768, none is optimized for today's widescreen LCD monitors.) takes about 5 minutes.  During the layout change, the program simply would just freeze untill 5 minutes later the layout change is finished.

Starting the ACT! 2009 Premium Edition takes at least 1 min and 30 seconds for it to load only 3000 contacts and 3000 to-dos.  The original ACT! 2000? it takes it 0.5 seconds.  Wow, what a difference.  I don't understand how could they make a great program so S***ty garbage in just 9 years.

Open anything with over 1000 entries (Contacts, Groups, Tasks/To-do) takes over 30 seconds on the initial click, and 5 secons thereafter.

Selecting 2000 entries takes over 1 minutes, and completeing them by clearing them takes about 2-3 minutes......

This is nightmare, I'm suggesting my parent to switch back to ACT! 2000 till he finds a better CRM software."
I was advised to get this product by a computer tech.  It is very user friendly and have been very satisfied
"used this program for 10 years before disk failed, surprised it was the same cost. The streching feature allows you to ptint words with a much largwer font than any other program I've tried."
"I did not read any reviews and I ordered the TurboTax 2012 Premier CD-ROM. I am sorry that I am putting this review on the ""download page."" I could not find the separate CD-ROM page to post a review. But you should not download the product either. It would not run on my Macbook because it is 32 bit and not 64 bit. I was extremely disappointed. I checked online and I realized that I had made a huge mistake. I called Amazon and I told them I was sending the CD-ROM back. I hope they refund my money or Amazon will be losing a customer. I may even go into Small Claims Court to get my money back and also report it to the consumer news reporter on my local network news. I paid $64.14 to Amazon for this disc. An Intuit VP is posting online in some of the Mac forums with lame excuses for restricting the software to 64 bit Macs and he is encouraging people to use TurboTax online. I checked on that option and from what I could see, the online version of TurboTax Premier is not cheap - over $70.00! What an incredible ripoff!
Also, I am not buying that suggestion that I should go out and buy a new Mac. I do not have $1,500 for a new Mac laptop just to run TurboTax. I finally said a pox on all of their houses and I am going to do my 2012 taxes the old-fashioned way - by myself. I will download the forms I need from the IRS website. They come in a pdf format that allows data to be saved via Adobe Reader. When completed, I will print my forms out to be signed and then send them all to Internal Revenue. I will do the same for California state taxes. No one is getting any more money from me for tax preparation software. Bye-bye TurboTax! You have lost me forever as a customer. Come on people! Empower yourselves and let these corporations know that you are mad as hell and not going to take it anymore!!!"
Great AV
"With Foxpro, you don't need ADO, recordsets, complicated SQL syntactical nightmares. It scales to incredible sizes, provides multi-user DB access right out of the box, has no overbearing customer facing run time licenses, and saves you big bucks. It connects smoothly to SQL server and Oracle. It exports data to Excel Spreadsheets with a single line of code. It's string handling is fast and efficient, and the environment focuses developers on data first. Version 7 has a few good enhancements like CursorToXML and .dll creation that make it worthwhile. The Intellisense is great if you don't already know the language.
I get more done with Foxpro in twenty minutes than most VB programmers do in a week!"
"I was a Quicken user for many years, but got sick of their ploy every couple of years to cut off support and your ability to download if you didn't buy a pricey upgrade.  Then I went to Mint.com. but after numerous problems with certain banks downloading, then not, and discovering that there is no way to import a csv file into Mint.com, I had to give up on them.  I did a lot of research on the various financial management software products available and settled on Moneydance.com.  That was in 2011 and I have been a happy camper ever since.  Love Moneydance.com. It is easier to use than Quicken and quite powerful without being complicated. And their tech support is great.  Yes you have to ""contact"" them thru their website and the support is via email, but I always have an answer back within 12 hours at the most and often sooner.  Any problem I have ever had, which is only a few, they have resolved.  That is a lot more than I can say for Mint.com and Quicken.  This is great software with great support!"
Poor quality
I thought this was supposed to replace office it did nothing that office does but right glad it was free wasn't worth anything
"Well, what can I say bad about this product? Nothing! Great utilities and it would take years to learn them all. I don't use word for web creation because I use dreamweaver. I find that MS writes too much extra code on html pages. The best feature of woed is the styles menu for formatting long documents. A very competent programmer enlightened me about this years ago and I have more efficiently created long documents in word than in word perfect, which I stopped using years ago."
Older laptop with a dial up modem need the upgrade works great.
"Really like this photo editing program. I also have the Photomatic Pro, and like the Lightroom 6 better. I need to learn how to save my setting for other photos to save time."
"I upgraded to Parallels 11 recently for the specific purpose of upgrading my 2014 Macbook Pro to Windows 10. However, the Windows 10 upgrade did not work for me.  I was able to upgrade the OS with great difficulty, but the network drivers from Parallels cause an infinite loop of blue screens of death when loading Windows.

I contacted Parallels support about the issue and found them unhelpful, unresponsive, and generally incompetent. First, Parallels doesn't have a listed telephone support number (though I think you can call 425-336-3512). So I had to email them, and wait for them to respond to emails which was typically around 24 hours later. The responses were not helpful, so they scheduled a phone call (hence getting the support number). During the support call, the technical support person knew much less about the issue than myself, and I ended up having to help him fix issues that he caused during the call rather than the other way around.

After the frustrating phone call, I received the following email from Parallels support, stating that they had found a problem but couldn't help me or tell me when a fix would be available. Despite the fact that upgrading to Windows 10 had left my Windows machine unusable, they did not offer additional assistance to help restore Windows 7. I would encourage folks thinking about Parallels with Windows 10 to consider alternatives.

Excerpt from support email:
""I've reviewed the collected logs, and discovered a particular error on the code level that is affecting the functionality of your virtual machine. This error is already known to our Development Team, and they are working on introducing a fix in an upcoming update to Parallels Desktop. However, they do not share an ETA for a fix until one is available... urrent support ticket will be marked as Resolved to avoid ticket duplication in Support and Development lines."""
"I have not seen or used a lot of other Windows-based programs of this nature, but this one is easy to use out-of-the-box for the average user.  The only thing that I have come across that is somewhat difficult is the creation and modification of print templates, which is only necessary if you want a different print format than any of the many templates provided.  To get a columnar listing of your mailing list data you probably will want to create your own template.  The software author should make this process simpler and bug free (template creation and modification  currently has a few bugs, which can be worked around if you have the patience).  This opinion is also from an IT administrator.  I have no idea why an IT person would find this program difficult to use."
Yay not happy for some weird reason when downloading my upgrade it wiped  all my stored information !!!! What a Pain in the Butt
I had for a month now & problems so far
it was for my daughter
"Of all the thousands of hours we've spent learning and getting used to Windows, all of a sudden, they turn everything on its head and make you relearn this Windows from scratch.

I have run XP at work and at home for over ten years, and bought a new tower with Windows 8 preinstalled. I've never been so angry and frustrated at Microsoft.

What a bunch of crap. You HAVE to have an email address to make this POS run and give Microsoft a password every time you log in. The escape button is worthless. When you are really stuck, it's really hard to get out to where you can make the computer function. Today, Microsoft actually had the nerve to throw a popup on my screen and try and sell me an upgrade to Windows 8.1.

If anyone out there is reading this that was a part of creating this Windows 8 fiasco, SHAME ON YOU."
I bought for 5 computers but it only installed on one and then started giving me error message.
Easy to use once you get the hang of it! A great way to start making your own games.
Works perfect.  Easy for a first-time user to learn.
code isn't there
Worked but is obsolete now.
"I've owned this program for three years and use it exclusively for writing novels.  I've tried cheaper programs and have experienced considerable difficulties with memory problems.  They simply cannot take the load of a  400+ page manuscript.  I've also used it to create tables, and it works  quite nicely.  The graphics placement takes a bit of tweaking, but once I  got the hang of it there was no problems.  The program also has HTML  features, but I have not used them yet.  I have, however, used the spelling  and grammar check quite extensively and have no qualms about those.  I  recommend this product for anyone who can't afford the hefty price of Word."
ok
this looks like an actual phone.it is really fun when evry morning i can open up my locker and hear my favorite band's real voices.
"I have been a beta tester for Quicken (Windows) for a number of years.  Each year I think ""I don't think anything can be improved over last year's.""

It is only compatible with certain bill pay vendors from their own drop down list.
Many bill pay vendors such as water services, storage unit facilities, etc. are not available for linking to their Quicken bill pay :(
At the time of purchase I figured we would simply link our website through the software like common sense would suggest but no dice . . .

"I purchased this in late December 2014 and it worked very well for eight months, then refused to publish, giving constant read/write temp file errors.  Unfortunately, after contacting Xara ""tech"" support several times via email, nothing came of it.  Their ""tech"" support is useless....no phone number, no nothing.  You send a ""ticket"" through their website and wait...days...weeks.....and then hope a friend can instead help you.  Very poor customer service, and it is clear that they are not interested in perpetuating either good customers or good products.  Furthermore, their parent company MAGIX is just that...a cloud of magic; no help from them either, despite their listed ""help"" phone number (1-305-722-5810).  It was fun creating a website, but not everyone is an expert in coding or HTML, and while Xara WD10 Premium started out nice, it's getting very annoying.
UPDATE!  Three weeks after continual .temp errors, Xara ""support"" still has not done anything to troubleshoot or assist.  Don't waste your money on supporting this company."
"I should have checked here first.  I went on the HGTV site and this looked like a good program  How wrong I was.  The program was not fully functional and the tutorial is poor.  If I want to get the answer it is $9.95 for technical assistance on a brand new program!!!!!  Are you joking?  I am pretty the savvy and this just would not work.  It shows a 90 satisfaction guarantee.....but I tried to click on it to see how that works and nothing happens.....the cut ton for ""contact"" doesn't yield much either.  If I don't get satisfaction from HGTV (there name is on it after all), I am going to pursue until I do."
"I am the director of Colorado Youth Chorale (CYC), a community choir for high school aged singers.

I started using Finale 14 years ago to reduce the hours I was spending hand-penning my scores. Even then Finale was far and away the best music engraving tool, and each year the developers have added significant improvements (such as the ability to make Wave playback files directly from the score).  In recent years Finale has integrated SmartScore music recognition software and steadily improved Finale's interaction with that tool.  More recently has been the addition of Garritan Personal Orchestra, giving Finale realistic instrumental playback.

The marriage of these three tools has been indispensable to my work but the heart of it all is Finale's ability to create beautiful engraver-quality scores and the flexibility to make significant changes without starting from scratch.  Today I use Finale to create scores of original compositions and arrangements, and to scan scores for producing audio practice tracks for CYC singers.

Finale has not only met my original goal of reducing the time and increasing the quality of producing scores, but has also given me the ability to devise tools for others to acquire and improve their music skills; tools whose creation without Finale would at least much more difficult, and in some cases, impossible."
"What relief !

When I got rid of Vista & it's problems and purchased Windoes 7 I was relieved.

While I installed my Pagemaker 6.5 I found that it would not work with the new computer. Now I was not relieved.

Ouch - some several hundred files could not be accessed.

This up-grade software installed and works just fine.

It is necessary to have the serial number of the version being upgraded.

Relief !!!!"
Won't download.
Disc came in perfect shape. With key and folder in which the disc comes with. Just not the box as the seller described. Who needs a box anyway. This works perfect. Exactly what I was looking for! Highly recommended!
Product performs as expected and I have had problem.
"I consider myself above average user concerning making videos and have used other products such as Ulead, etc.

This software does about the same thing at much less on the cost spectrum.  It has many effects, transitions, and titling that you need to get the job done.  In my experience I thought it did not take a huge learning curve to understand how to use the interface.

For people with the trial version.  Certain features will not work.

For the price I think this product is a good deal."
"Items is as advertised. Windows operating systems are pushed to the market before they are finished. it is an okay operating system, though there are better."
"The business knowledge side of the software seems pretty good, so I assume the creator was a good business planner. BUT they weren't good programmers. This software is garbage. Your better off doing a little research on the web, then use a word processor and Excel to create your business plan.

My complaints:
1. It's clunky. In particular it's really hard to get a handle on what is going on because the spreadsheets feed data to each other, but not in any clear manner.
2. It doesn't cut and paste cleanly with other software. For example I pasted in sections from a word document that included a trademark symbol. This software can't handle it.
3. The software functions are limited and buggy. I tried to do a find and replace to fix the trademark issue. They can find the pasted gibberish that was the trademark symbol, but can't paste their own trademark symbol. Manual correction was the only choice.
4. The online support is pretty limited. Heavy on installation info, although installation went pretty easily.
5. Some of their own tables don't fit the pages correctly. They wrap in a way to make them almost unreadable.
6. They have a task list which could have been a nice idea. However the implementation is such that it misses any additional sections or tables the wizard or the user inserts. Why? This really wouldn't have been that hard to do right.
7. When you delete a default section the task list didn't seem to figure this out either.

The good:
1. The tech support folks are pretty quick to respond. Unfortunately due to software limitations, there isn't much useful they can tell you.
2. The generated table of contents is automatic. Too bad the numbering of sections is screwed up. Each section restarts the numbering.

Glad I didn't pay list and didn't pay extra for the ""premier version"". I'm certainly not going to buy any other software from them."
worked great
The app is great for reading purchased books. However I was very disappointed to find that I could NOT view my personal documents on this app. I kind of defeated the purpose of me downloading this app on my computer. The mobile versions for android and iOS is way better and more functional...
"I installed it today, and I uninstalled it today.  I bought it simply to print my own checks. That's it.  Nothing more.  I would have been fine had that been the only feature that actually worked. But it did not. I got through the check design steps with no problem.  I found it odd there was no actual 'save' button for the design I created.  Somehow it managed to save the template I designed.  Here is where it all fell apart.  Each template prints a little differently, north, south, east, west of the paper perforations.  The adjustment tool is pre-guess work, totally in the blind.  9 checks, 3 to a page and I finally got one to line up.  When I went to create my second design, none of the first adjustments applied and I was right back were I stated, wasting paper.  I have been in Information Technology for 35 years.  I know when to 'cut and run'.  Not worth the aggravation.  Oh, and it stopped responding and hung twice.  No, nothing is wrong with my PC, its the Checksoft software."
"i've used taxcut for about 4 years now.  i read the bad about the 2005 edition in the reviews, but i'd rather buy taxcut again than enter last year's data (i think they're counting on this!).

the short of it: still a good UI and pretty easy to use, but you might spend an hour+ installing and updating, possibly with your computer in 'safe mode'.

the installation & update was pretty painful.

- avast reported a virus in the state installation (win32:Trojan-gen.{other} Virus/Worm).  tech support said ""that happens with some virus programs""...uh yep.

- the installation failed with an error box: ""Invalid commandline syntax (see commandlineImpl::initOptions())""

- updating would not work, failing with the error ""CATax.dll could not be opened""

- tech support suggested that i restart my computer in 'safe mode' to complete the installation...safe mode to install a TAX program?!?!

- it took tech support an hour to fix the install and update, making the installation about an hour and a quarter process (i'll bet that the IRS didn't figure that into their time estimations...)

there's definitely some problems with the form 8801 as others have reported; it did not check the boxes correctly on the 8801 based on 2004 data, even though i had imported it from taxcut 2004.  i had to open the form manually and correct it.

if either taxpayer has any W2's at all, it will not even ask if there are any self-employed deductions for either.

all that aside, the UI seems a bit faster than it has been in previous years, and it still is pretty easy to use.  i hope they work on it harder for next year given its slipping ratings against turbotax...."
Been using the software for years.  Each new upgrade brings nice new features.  Though at time the software seems bloated and slow.
"Love that there are all these years of photoss on disc, but the quality of these is very disappointing."
"This new OS is interesting.  There are some features that ""get in the way"" as I hate having to verify everything I just told the computer to do.  However, it is a nice upgrade as far as security and speed goes.  Keep in mind that the hardware requirements listed are minimum requirements and Vista will operate much better on a newer machine with a faster processor, more RAM and higher end video card.  It is a much faster OS than XP, but the changes require some getting used to.  I would recommend holding off on upgrading at this time as there are a lot of programs that will not run on Vista as yet and even some that do are having issues with MS updates causing problems.  Roxio Media Suite 9 is Vista compliant, but Vista pops a warning and shuts down a driver on system boot that is related to the Roxio software.  Rhapsody doesn't work properly with it."
Any version of GHOST is a good product to have. Allows the complete copy of a hard drive for later retrieval or to use as a backup. The only way to back up your hard drive.
"Have used this product since it was available as ""Ask Dan"". For my needs is a superior product."
It's Windows 7 what can I can.  It runs my computer.  No bugs or anything...great purchase for anyone.  Would recommend.
"Do not buy this product.  This product is a Windows Operating System plus a bundle of open source programs used to open up back doors in your computer.  If you run this cd, your computer is extremely vulnerable to hijacking.  The computer will not close properly, and will start up without being turned on.  To find the open source programs, go into the program section of the control panel.  You will see the programs there."
Just as Advertised!
"I bought this because it was the cheapest option to upgrade my windows 10 home to windows 10 pro, however, once I we installed it the product key was bad. If you buy this you will eventually return it. Amazon should screen the companies selling through them better. This product is not sold by Microsoft. You have been warned."
"The unit is OK, what I had problems with is with the order. The box it came in was missing a cable to charge the item. In order to work it MUST be connected directly to my bike's battery. The adapter provided was not the adequate version and so I have had trouble loading software since I must either charge the unit by having it hooked on the bike or at my desk being loaded with map software. It's a bummer.

If you purchase this unit be careful to ask for the right a charging cable."
Having difficulties installing on my laptop
"I am using the program to review my French, and find it useful for accent, listening, and waking up my buried French knowledge. I can't imagine learning the language this way as an absolute beginner. The limited vocab and highly structured repetition would be good for absolute beginners, but the relative lack of explanations, especially about grammar, would drive me crazy if I didn't have a good sense of grammar to start with. The ""explanations"" by the young woman who drones on and on are fairly skimpy, and her attitude is so condescending and irritating that it is difficult to listen to her.

That said, there is a pretty good mix of listening, reading and writing. The ability to record oneself and listen to one's pronunciation is a definite plus.

This is an expensive set of DVDs and I was surprised to find no written materials accompanying it. It is hard to consider this a complete set of language learning materials when there are no written grammatical explanations.

This program is not fun. It could be lighter, funnier, and charming, and that WOULD be fun. I have seen other French programs that are. But this one is not. Nevertheless, it is an OK way to review (or possibly learn) French."
"There are many things I don't like it. Here are some from the top of the list:

1. The amazon photo app in my devices didn't sync to the content in the cloud and different devices missed different files.
2. Upload always has random failure for one or two files and it's a hassle to find the files and upload them again.
3. Terrible technical support, ever. I cannot believe it's a product from Amazon. Support requests were ignored or no solution at all.

"I used a program called 3D Home Architect about 15 years ago to design the house I built and live in.  When it came time to finish my basement, I had hoped that this evolution of that program would be even better.  Instead, it is close to being the worst piece of software I have ever seen or used (and I've been a computer geek for over 35 years).  It is anything but intuitive.  I'll give just a couple of examples.  The previous programs I've used, you merely had to identify which floor you were building, and the program would automatically make adjustments in wall types etc.  There is no easy way to do this with this program.  When you want to add EXTREMELY common items to the plan (such as placing an electrical sub-panel or bathroom sink), you simply opened up a well populated library of objects and grabbed the desired object on the plan.  I tried to place a bathroom sink, but none of the bathroom sinks that are in the program come even close to resembling a normal bathroom sink.  When I *finally* found an electrical subpanel and tried to place it on the plan, nothing happened, at least I didn't think it did.  When I zoomed in 400%, I could see a tiny circle with an ""e"", which was suppose to be the electrical panel.  If I can, I will be getting my money back."
"I cant believe how a company that created Easy CD creator  4.0 can trash it so badly in the sequel.
I have wasted a perfectly good sat afternoon installing this beast with the following headaches:
1. Try to add tracks from a CD to the playlist and it just sits there forever..
2. Tried another laptop and it gives me a error saying cannot create ...,when I start up Easy CD Creator
3. soundstream just sits there initializing....
4. Tried another and the machine won't shut down
And its a HOG. It takes up over 200 M and it has to be installed on the boot drive. for those of us who  have factory defined 2 G boot partitions are SOL.
Yes I agree with another reviewer. This product WAS NEVER TESTED."
love this....how does amazon do it.... someone need to spank  Bill Gates.isn't he rich enough without wanting to force us to buy office on a monthy bases?
"Be warned, despite the product description, not all the games included are Mac compatible. The Oregon Trail 5 and Liberty's Kids games work, which are okay games, nicely updated, maybe a little boring. However, ClueFinders and Where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego do NOT work. These are reasons I bought the pack."
Bought to replace Family Lawyer.  Easy to use.
The product was just what I wanted and was shipped ASAP! Will definitely buy similar prodcuts again.
"Millions of dollars are wasted by having others do your taxes.  I have done my taxes at home as a test, taken them to an accountant or H&R Block, and come back with the same results.  I have talked with folks who spend over $100 every year to do this April 15 headache.  Don't waste your money.  Start using Turbo Tax and you will never go back ."
"This is a wonderful product for the price. I used it in conjunction with Sew Art and I made a great company logo. There is the option to bring in the See Art graphic and do the lettering around it. It may be a little more cumbersome to use than the $1000 version, but after even trying some of the used older software versions with the key of those expensive ones, I'm glad I saved my money and bought Buzzword."
Great Birthday present for my son!  He originally wanted something else that sounded like this but he figured out how to play it and enjoyed it.
Keeps crashing and doesn't respond to things I try and have it do.
"I just upgraded from Leopard to Snow Leopard and I couldn't be happier.  I'm glad that Apple didn't bloat out their newest OS, but instead decided to tighten it up.  The best thing about Snow Leopard is the hard drive space gained from the installation.  I went from having 375gb to 407gb.  That's a gain of 32gb by simply installing a new OS.  Most of the upgrades seem to be minor, but that's ok because Leopard was a nearly perfect operating system as it was and Snow Leopard has just made it that much better.  It installed in lighting fast time and has been incredibly stable since.  I really don't know what the problem is unless people are loading it on non-Intel machines.  All in all, for the price I think this has been one of the best OS updates Apple has ever put out and I would be happy if they continued to streamline their OS instead of bloating it out like Microsoft."
"The conversion process from Quickbooks Online (which by the way, they will hook you in with <$20/mo fee starting and surprise you with ~$30/mo fee) is so convoluted and asinine that I would not recommend Quickbooks (either online or Desktop) to anyone if you and your Accountant has a choice about it. Also, their user interface in QB 2016 is slow as f and my computer is spec'd quad core 3.1 gHz / 22 gb ram. f u intuit"
Very helpful for my grandson loves it
This is THE way to do your taxes. Saves your info year to year.. Super easy and fast returns.
Great item.
"I have used two other versions of Pinnacle Studio, both 9 and 10 on older pcs.  I was happy with my previous versions and actually prefer to use the version 9.  However the older versions would not handle the mov format and would not work on my new Windows 8 machine.  It does what it is designed to do but is not as user friendly as earlier versions and is actually quite complicated with all the capabilities.  It does the job for me though and was a good price.  I recommend it for anyone wanting to edit and burn DVDs of their home movies."
I've used TaxCut every year for the last 4 or 5 years and it's great! The price is much cheaper than going to a professional tax preparer and it's exactly the same software that H&R Block uses.
simply  the Best!
"I have had nothing but trouble since I purchased this transitions 7 CD from CrystalGraphics. They don't tell you that the transitions are only seen by others who have the same PowerPlugs software. If you have a problem saving the transitions to your presentation, that's because the transitions are for your eyes only. When you call to get this straightened out, expect at least a week before they contact you. I called, we talked, and they never resolved my issues nor did they call back. Why buy a transitions CD that works only when you view your presentation and will not save to the presentation? Doesn't this defeat the purpose of a transitions CD program? Save your money, do not buy this product.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PowerPlugs-Transitions-for-PowerPoint-Volume-7/dp/B000M3O7JA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PowerPlugs: Transitions for PowerPoint Volume 7</a>"
"I ""upgraded"" from 2012 because for reasons that could not be explained it was becoming unstable. I just traded an old set of problems for new ones.
In my experience both Quicken 2012 and 2014 are unstable on Windows 8: the pointer often generates a spinning circle, something I do not see in Windows 7.
The program will not save or back up files period. Not to any directory or any media in Windows 8. Quicken says not to back up or save to online backup services like Dropbox, which is insane, or trying to force you to pay for their backup service.
It takes up to ten clicks to enter data into the payee slot of the check register because of an idiot balloon/sound effect. The only work around I find is to click on a non-Quicken window and then back into Quicken (sometimes).
Quicken chat support as usual is useless. This being a weekend there is no telephone or email support.
Data entry and data saving: if Intuit can't get that right after all these years what does that tell you? Unfortunately there really are not competing programs that theoretically (because in reality Quicken is more of a theoretical proposition than a reliable program) can do what Quicken is supposed to do."
AN IMPROVEMENT OVER PRIOR VERSIONS.  PREV USING 2012 AND THIS IS A DEFINITE IMPROVEMENT
"I'm giving this product a ""4"" because I think Garmin and their maps make for the best GPS available.  (I've tried TomTom a couple of times -- the map data in the US was really bad)  Unfortunately, this SD card did not work with a Garmin 2699.  I tried the Open Street Map download for Garmin, and it ""sort of"" worked  in Switzerland but did have a few problems.  I ended up using OSM for Android on my phone much of the time.  The seller, vpoint2015, refunded the purchase and shipping cost.  That is great customer service."
"We gave it our best shot. So did their techs during a phone call and two emails. They thought my Anti-virus sofware was to blame.

The problems I encountered have to do with network permissions, not anti-virus software. I called Dell and McAffee and niether knew of a fix. I have a stand-alone computer, I am the administrator. Between my wife and I, we have over 55 years in PC and mainframe computing experience. They weren't helpful, the software is full of pitfalls and need to be re-configured to allow for a ""dumbed-down"" approach to the simple task of copying files to an external drive. ""out of the box instructions do not require that anti-virus software be turned off, nor that the destination drive be set for NTFS file config. Both were offered as helpful suggestins, but neither worked.

Sorry, but for the average user, we can't recommend Novabackup, nor your customer service capabilities. During two three hour attempts, Novabackup didn't even get past the ""write"" stage."
This worked well for me. All my taxes are done
I have used H&R Block (previously TaxCut) for the last few years.  This download was quick and easy - and the best price I found anywhere.
This was a gift for our Pastor.  He is so pleased with it.  Was delighted that it would go in his computer without using disk . . .
Great worked well
Have had all since version 1 and still love it
I was able to put an almost new condition 4 year old laptop back to use. My buddy and messed around with it when he bought it an rendered it useless. Put a 2 tb hard rive in at the same time. Working great now. Install was easy.
The program had errors that would not automatically update itself. Had to down load a patch and run it independent of the program.  Whenever I started the program and it when  to check for updates it found the same error.  finally updated and choose to not check for updates. Also it held on to the school ID from our previous address two years ago which had an income tax and our current one does not.
Sorry- but I guess I like MS Power Point a whole lot better.
"It has the simplest & easiest to use, fastest & largest interface for selecting the files/folders to backup.

( In backup Options) Just unCheck the option to Retain Full Path, and it will keep working.
Also uncheck Save Previous File Versions, if you get errors."
"I have always used Turbo Tax in the past, (probably swayed by advertisements). I decided to try H&R Block this year, because of favorable reviews on Amazon. I was very pleased with the cost, simplicity, design and help guidance throughout the program. I purchased the Premium software and I feel comfortable in recommending it to others."
I have had some problems with this purchase.  In trying to be fair to the company who sold me the software they did follow up after I had an incident with the activation key.  But I have misplaced the key after downloading 2 of 3 installations and I don't find any email with the info or a way to activate the third.  I also was not ever able to activate the outlook portion  of office on any computer ever.  Not sure what that is all about but I need it now and am not sure how to get help.
Why not???
Very quick delivery.  Product worked exactly as listed and Peachtree support was extremely helpful.
I didn't receive it on my phone or my tablet.
I used to update quicken every year since 96.  About 3 years ago I now wait 2-3 years between updates as they have really stopped adding new useful stuff with each update.  Still have issues with downloads from certain backs and budgeting is a joke.  I wish Intuit would invest some money in this product instead of just milking it.  Quicken 2016 is great if you do not own a version of quicken from the last couple years.  I challenge you quicken to make a video of really why I should upgrade from last year. Make me excited to pull out me wallet vs going Meeehhh!'  Think I will skip this years update.
This is an excellent tool that allows to access all you library in a very friendly way. It has new features. and is very easy to install.
Set up was easy.  Seems to work but who knows what is or is not getting in.  But it does not slow down the system and does not seem to cause other harm.  The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is I have no way of knowing if it is stopping all the most recent threats.
"You're better off finding a box, filling it with rocks, then take the money out of your wallet that you would have paid for this and light it on fire. At least when the money is gone you'll have a handy box of rocks. This is a Rip Off. Greed has produced an illusion of a product. I don't normally fall for this kind of Snake Oil, but it was in a reputable store and I wanted what it said it would do, and became blind to the fact that the company didn't advertise a location, telephone number, website, on the package, blah, blah, blah. All the reviews about blinking messages, not being able to read music on your computor, etc, I experienced with my first hour of trying to figure out if this pathetic box of junk could produce anything worth while. It did not. I wish I had the box of rocks. Zero Stars."
not all the games worked on our computer... I should have only bought the one my kids were asking for. I though this bundle would be worth it but since I can't utilize them it really isn't. Oregon trail worked. Where in the World is Carmen San Diego would not open. Have not tried the others yet.
"I'm not sure how this was released, but I'm not surprised that Quicken isn't promoting it on their own website. Clearly not ready for primetime. The budget tool isn't even usable - hierarchies of categories don't work, two-income households seem like a foreign concept to the budget structure, and the whole program is almost completely incompatible with Windows 7. Unbelievable how poorly build the current program is."
"I just got done downloading this product on my windows xp home edition with Norton security system. I had NO PROBLEMS AT ALL!!!! Before all you people start blaming Amazon for your download problems you might want to consider that, 1. The problem is with your PC or the security software you have installed. 2. You did not follow the download instructions. OR 3. And this kinda ties in with 2. You got all impatient and canceled out the download or install on your own, thinking something was wrong because it was taking too long. Jeeze!!! Have a cup of coffee or something there is nothing wrong with the download it just takes awhile. And before you get all defensive ask yourself why I had no problems but you did?"
"Act! 2006 does what I ask of it. I have not investigated a lot of the ""bells and whistles"" at this time. One reason I chose this product over others is that it did what I needed without being overly complex."
Quick and easy to install and set up but highly dissapointed that I can't use it to track loans and it doesn't have the same features as the version for PC so I returned it to buy the PC version.
"Fullfils my expectations...great price specially that the item is  good for three computers. It offers good protection, antivirus, and other protection."
Not compatible with Microsoft office documents
"Followed the instructions. Asked for some simple stock option info as requested. But it didn't ask for info on the amount of the sales.
At the end. The error check said all was good even though I had noted that I had sold stock options and no Schedule D was generated by HR Block.

HR Block offered a refund if I had purchased it from them. But Unfortunately I bought it from Amazon. Which doesn't offer refunds on defective software  they sale via downloads. Not certain what their policy is for physical media. I wound up buying Turbotax from Costco and now have a worthless copy of HR Block Tax Software.

Unfortunately I have too short a memory. Once every couple years I've tried buying software from Amazon's software download only to have problems. I would not recommend buying software from Amazon's download service."
no compliants here!
"I've used an accountant for years, left over from and old business.
I used this for the 1st time last year and it got the job done.
They dinged my for more money at the checkout for 2010, but it was less than I had been paying.
I wanted control of my taxes, that's why I switched.

I expected them to email me a full retail priced 2011 version which they did.
I'm sure they get takers on that.

I shop at Amazon and noticed that they were offering it at a better price ($20) less
I went on line and was offered a matching price from the Turbo Tax chat room rep.
I said thanks but no thanks and bought mine from Amazon.

My worse fear doing this was I would not be able to get last years info transferred to the 2011 version.
This is because I saved last years return on their server.
Sure enough i was right. You can't log into your (account) with a new offsite purchased discounted 2011 version. You have to have last years return saved on your PC.

There is a work around which worked but it seemed funky.
You have to fake an order to get the info, then save it as a PDF.
I think that's total wrong but what ever.

Because of these issues I gave the software and Intuit a low rating.
I'm still a Turbo Tax customer.
I wish they would be more upfront on the price or prices and let you log into your account from a new discounted software purchase.

I don't think I would recommend this product to anyone.

Update;I found another glitch.
My IRA is funded from pre-taxed dollars.
The capitol gains are all I should be taxed on.
There no way to do this calculation in this software.
I dinged me as if it was all from pre-tax contributions.
I now have to go back to my accountant and refile."
"I have installed Leopard more than one week ago, and it has running very smooth in my mac. I had no problems to use my old programs, and they run as fast as they ran in Tiger. Time machine is really a great tool. Overall, the new OS is more elegant and has several features to help one to take more of his/her mac."
Still great after all these years.
love it
"I would love to pretend that I was techno-savvy, but I would be lying.  I do okay, thanks to patient friends.  I've been able to handle this software on my own, which is a good sign!  I did (do) have a little difficulty creating in the portable format, but that's not something I expect to do often.

Software works well and is idiot friendly (no offence to my fellow idiots).  Probably not as many bells-and-whistles options as more savvy users would want, but this works for me!"
"You buy it once for $90 and then next year you have to do the same thing, another $90.  I don't know how much money you end up saving."
Constant book supply
Already had the app but it didn't work after I installed Windows 10.  This re-install works o.k.
I have used TurboTax almost exclusively for over 10 years. Software is simple and interfaces well with Fedeal and State functions. Never a pleasure doing taxes but not as much of a chore.
"I had been using FTM 2005 and thought it was time for an upgrade.  I was hoping the new version would have better reports, but they are basically the same, but they cannot be readily copied and pasted into other programs (such as Word) like they used to, they only can be copied to an .rft file.  Every page then has formatting that is tedious to change or remove (horizontal lines).

The trees you can view on the screen are a little better, but they have tried to cram so much onto the main ""family group"" screen that it is too busy and cluttered.

If it hadn't been so cheap, I would have asked for my money back.  I'll keep it in case I find a use for some of its features, but I have gone back tothe 2005 version."
"I got this software for free after the mail-in-rebate. Even after that will strongly advise anybody from buying this software. This is nothing more than a Wordpad application. If you want help with resumes you will have more luck at any of the online resume sites.
  If you are expecting this software to give you multiple templates and hints, you will be disappointed. There are only around 6 or 7 templates which are not impressive.
  Bottomline is that it is waste of money(if you paid for this software) and time."
I loaded this product on my new laptop without trying WIN7 I skipped this version all together and it works better than all other versions
"very user friendly, above expectations"
The case did not work with my iphone 5.  The phone did not fit in the case.  I was disappointed.
"The Dragon was exciting to work with! I'm a non-techie beginner and bought what I thought would be the easiest version to get started.
I would have to reserve my review on the product itself due to a hard drive failure. Replaced and running, but Dragon will not reload and tech support is nowhere to be found.
I don't believe I could justify buying a second copy when I should be allowed to use the first.
As a writer, I had hopes of moving forward with this product to enhance my work output.
Dissapointed."
"Version 20 (twenty!) of any small, simple program written over the course of at least a decade should be a highly refined and very effective piece of software.
My perspective is from having used version 10 or 11 at least 10 years ago. It was useful at the time at improving my nil typing skills. At this time I called tech support with some helpful suggestions and someone actually answered (probably before Broderbund) as to software bugs I had experienced. I was told Mavis actually existed and was committed to providing opportunities for poor Southern children to further their limited opportunities, certainly a noble aspiration.
A recent Google search reveals that there is no Mavis except for some LA weasel who clearly loves to deposit checks but knows zilch about software.
Version 20 (Platinum, qv)would bring an A+ to a community college student of C++ software writing for a term project. Some specific criticism for the real world are as follows:

Non Windows Compliant: Pseudo DOS program (you can't minimize it to do any other normal Windows task, eg, check email etc). UNFORGIVABLE for version 20 of any modern program.

Pseudo, phony  Mavis complements you on your progress in spite of having made 4 or 5 mistakes in a given lesson. You have to turn her imaginary, annoying voice off in order to focus on typing.

If this is one of the best typing programs, as described in reviews, then this is a ripe opportunity for some youngblood software type to write some decent code and put Mavis to rest.

Nuff said."
"I got tired of using Norton, and Kaspersky had great reviews, so I tried it.
Pros: quick to install, and presumably roots out the nasties.
Cons: it has a huge memory footprint; I and the rest of my family had to disable the email checking, or else get 3-4 copies of every email; and we had to disable the web-site protection, or have our web browser hang and crash (on Firefox, Chrome, and IE)."
Was recommended by a friend
"The product seemed to be as advertised, however my computer had a more serious problem. I ultimately scrapped Windows altogether and loaded Ubuntu as an operating platform."
"Tricky as all the ones for MACS, but the info/records are adequate.  Entry of individual transactions are sometimes difficult"
Excellent for cheap reading
Have had no problems with this
"Complete, no problems ... good external support from your local H&R office.  Good price ... have used this product for years and have never had a problem."
"Not intuitive at all. Very limited built-in help.  Hard-to-access service and no answer at their 800 number. All-in-all the 2 of 5 stars I'm giving is generous.  The actual product isn't bad, but you need to be a BitDefender employee in order to figure it out.  After 5 emails asking for help, I got a generic response with instructions to email them for help!"
This is the only way I will attempt to do my own taxes. The program walks you through the process and you have explanatory materials at your fingertips when you need them.
ok
"This software is extremely difficult to use, with this difficulty compounded by the fact that it doesn't always work as it should. I have experience with various CAD programs and understand how things 'should' work. This Punch stuff is far from it. I also write software and agree with the first reviewer: I would be hiding if this were my product. Don't waste your money unless you like being frustrated."
This was a replacement for software my Daughter had a some years ago but was not compatible with her new computer.  This did not work on Windows XP as advertised.  Big disappointment.
Since I love to read this works for me.
"The detail for the parks is really good although not all parks are shown such as several state parks in my state are missing. But I suppose that is to be expected with a National Park edition.  As usual with Garmin map products, if you look at other than the parks some streets will just not be there or only partially.
Not all trails are shown either in the Parks."
It's always so easy to do my taxes with Turbo tax.
"i have 11 months and three weeks left on my 15 month subscription and the ENORMOUS popups are every day often several times a day. this issue began plaguing me last week. worst for me it totally disrupts my concentration, focus while working. there is no way to disable this other than to uninstall the product.

yesterday while working once again front and center one of their sales popups but this time it resulted in me losing time, work (their popups cover 20% of the screen area) i wasn't certain what the last item entered in the string series was so i had to do it all over from scratch. i lost part of the days work let alone the stress,.. but it all comes down to greed imho.

a few years ago bitdefender began doing this same type in your face popup ads months before it was time to renew. their product forums were filled with angry long time users that when faced with popups chose to leave in droves. i will be going with another vendor when this subscription runs out, assuming i can tolerate their ads for the next 11 mos."
I have used Norton. I have used McAfee. I have used AVG. Without question avast! is the best of all. It is easy to install.  It is easy to use. It has useful features such as SoftwareUpdater. It is automatically updated at least once a day. When I try to go to a site that is questionable it warns me instantly. I have had no virus or malware problems since I installed avast! and I am entirely pleased and satisfied with this product.
This product will protect your lap top & allow you to find it if it is stolen.  Works on cars & on lap tops.  You can trace the stolen lap top right to where it is.  Then have police close in to make the arrest!
"It is not as full featured as the Adobe products, but what you get in this little package is perfect for the non-professional photo editor or illustrator."
thank you
I really like it!  its really professional and Im using it for all my projects!  It works great!
"I bought my Dad a computer from a little shop preinstalled with Windows 7 Pro.  He accidently updated it to Windows 10 which rendered his Canon printer unusable due to the lack of driver.  Therefore, I uninstalled Win 10 and when I did, he got the message that his version of Win 7 Pro was not genuine.  The shop I purchased it from closed of course therefore I purchased this disk.  It came in earlier than promised and all I had to do is type in the product key and it activated quickly - problem solved!"
"There is nothing magical to say. It's QuickBooks. It does what you would expect QuickBooks to do. If you need a layman's accounting solution, it works."
Turbo Tax is really easy to use for the average person.  It takes the complication out of taxes.
"MC6 has excellent capabilities.  I have already produced music to help me learn songs for the choir.  I have found that documentation could be a lot better.  There is not an overall manual and finding information on issues is tough.  I have a lot of questions on ""How to do this and that?"" and there are not any or at least hard to find.  There needs to be a well written (comprehensive) manual on the theory of the program and how to navigate it and address the subtle issues.  If one is intended to do a lot of music programming He will want to know and fully understand all the features of the program.  But if the info is there it is scattered about.  One real hurdle is the terminology, as one relatively new to this kind of program (except I played with adlib in the early 90's)  However, for $40, it was a great bargain.  I wasn't sure it did what I wanted because i struggle with the language and terminology they use since it is specific to its industry.  I knocked two stars for poorly documentation but then I added one back because of the low price.  I think that if I can learn or figure out the details of what I'm missing, it will be a great program."
"Handles just about most of the common MS office products plus other like images and pdf.  Plus you are able to see your email attachments directly in your main and able to drill down on them to open them up.
Some drawbacks are:
If the PDF has images, you will not be able to see them within the document.
If you have a memory expansion card, you can not automatically have it set to sync to the memory card.  It always goes to the main memory and you have to manually change them to be stored on your memory card."
I like this and go back and forth between here and Lightroom.  I do like some of the additional features that come with this that you don't have with lightroom.
"Good, bug-free, easy to use"
"Don't buy.  I have had Nortons for years but I was due to renew and got this version.  Got it because when I tried to renew online the only option was to select ""auto-renew"".  So i bought this, installed, and it killed my printer.  I have been trying off and on for 2 days and still get ""can't communicate with printer"" when I try to print.  Reboot, reinstall, the works.  Nothing in pitiful ""help"" menu mentions printer issues.  Printer isn't networked or anything.  Simple USB connection and Windows 10 'sees' the computer just fine.  No network map in Nortons anymore.  Nowhere in nortons can I find anything that mentions it might be blocking a printer.  Just junk!

Should mention there is a ""workaround"".  Disable Nortons firewall and the printer works fine."
"Bought this game at Walmart. It wouldn't load. Got as far as loading installer. Then it would go to not responding. Then an error. Walmart wouldn't take it back and the following day, all were removed from the shelf. Getting on hand software to respond is like getting a wall to talk. Its not happening. Total waste of $10. Only reason it gets a star because amazon requires it. So.. - 1Star."
"I have been reconciling my accounts the old fashioned way for way too long.  I purchased Quicken for Mac and easily uploaded all of my account transactions for multiple accounts. The reconciliation isn't really necessary, but it was super quick and easy!  I feel like a load has been lifted off my shoulders as I will be able to keep up with knowing what's coming in and going out of my accounts so much easier now!"
"I paid for this DL and DL it, and it froze on me. Could not complete it. Ended up going to a CPA and getting my taxes done through them. A waste of $55.00!"
"Had my biggest tax refund ever. Always did my taxes using the online version (TurboTax website). This year bought the downloadable version because had problems using the online one. The filing process went very smooth and was very easy to follow. Highly recomend if you own property(ies), are an expatriate, and even for small business owers or self employed people. You'll be able to get all the deductions, exclusions and credits you can think of with this. It'll even tell you if you qualify for them."
satisfactory
"The product is great and I love how much comes with the product, however, the main disk works with DVD rom drives, not CD rom drives which is what I have so make sure you have the right drive before you buy it."
not always the easiest to use but it works
"I prefer the look and more simplistic design of Windows 7 than Windows 8. If they removed the new start 'board' from windows 8 and replaced it with the old start menu, I would buy Windows 8."
"Well, basically, I can't write a great review if I can't even figure out how to use the product.  I'm no expert, but I am fairly computer literate.  This product came with no user guide, nothing...  On screen instructions might as well be in programmer code.  I am planning on buying a different product and feel this one was a waste of my time and money.  I read the reviews of this product before buying and figured the quality of product would outweigh the negatives of the customer service issues but I haven't even been able to discover the quality of the product!"
Been using AVG since 2009 when Norton AV started giving me huge performance problems all the time. AVG on the PC is just fine even if it's a little overzealous in its activities. I don't understand the problems others are posting about since I have never had one in almost 6 years of usage. I did however take off one star for it sometimes being a little overzealous.
It does the job.
I have used the H & R Block tax software for years and am very satisfied with it. Imports information from the previous year saving time reentering information.
"I agree with the person who said this game was decent. This game is not awesome, but it doesn't suck either. There are somethings I liked about it that guitar hero does not have and some things that needed to possibly be added...(no, the things I'm sure people are thinking). It was a little easier to play I found than guitar hero. I personally found one thing that helps with the sound and gameplay, is that if you work your way to ""unlocking"" more guitars, you well get better gameplay (at least for sound, that is). As of now, I do have all the ""guitar"" games, I understand that if you are a parent and don't want the ""other games"" because of the message, but personally for me, I like to have variety. who knows...maybe guitar praise will ""upgrade"" and get better than, if not over both rock band and guitar hero."
I tried a couple of the other packages and found them to lack either parental controls or not work in a home network.  This version has both - and was relatively easy to setup. It worked for me and I would recommend it.
"I can't say enough about the buying experience with this product.  It arrived within one day and was actually an upgraded version.(at no additional cost) of the product I had ordered, because my original order was on back order.  Do yourself a favor and buy here."
"The program is very overpriced and is pretty much a tutorial on how to copy and paste and draw in gimp. All you do is copy their code into your ""mod"" you don't learn ANY of the fundamentals of the Java language. Mods are very very limited

You can make
Sword
Shovel
Pick axe
Your own ""item""
Block
And biome

To make it a real mod you have to know the REAL language of java"
"The product is fantastic - the support from their technicians outstanding!!

Had a problem with the computer running slow - half an hour with their technicians and it's like new again."
Not working correctly and Intuit hasn't been able to fix it.
The software is only usable on your computer. They want you to spend more money for mobile access! I mean aren't we in the 21st century? Everything should be mobilized. We DO NOT need to be up sold!
slowed system to the point it nearly did not work
"great tool / power point / microsoft word / excell ....can not do without it.
Easy to use, friendly, very pleased."
"The fine print of the EULA states that the software is bound to one computer only.  If you have your computer repaired or if you buy a new computer, you'll have to buy Office again for the new computer.  Terrible.  Just terrible."
"I had the 2007 version in my computer, and decided to change the OS in my computer and lost it, I bought this 2010 version and I am very happy with it, also the price was the best I could find.  Thank you!!!!"
ok
"My husband downloaded his with no problem.  I had a problem because I originally had Microsoft Works 8.0 on mine.
No problem being a Windows 7 Computer.  It took a long time to get rid of the Works 8.0 completely before the Works 9.0
would download onto my Computer.  I'm the one who has used Microsoft Works 8.0 for years.  I keep record of all the bills, ex
and use it daily.  I was surprised mine came in a cardboard envelope.  The disc was well protected.  My husband kept saying
maybe I needed another program but I had years of information.  I was just upset it did not automatically go on.  I had to go through an hour for searching and deleting 100% of Microsoft Works 8.0 before I could download the Microsoft 9.0  My husband had no Microsoft Works previously on his computer."
"I have used a lot of home video editing software and I have got to say this is the best I have used so far. Just professional enough to make some really great videos, but simple enough that you don't have have special training to do so."
"This software has all of the features that most ""amateurs"" need, probably a lot more.  It also provides excellent organization capabilities."
"I have used Quicken since the Windows 95 days and upgraded on a regular basis.  For the most part I have found it be a very good product.  This time, I was forced to upgrade my two year old version which worked fine, because the company disabled all the account download features (the only reason to use it) effective this April.  On installing the new version, I can see no improvement over the old version.  In addition the new version constantly harasses you via annoying pop ups that cannot be disabled to buy additional products.  I resent being extorted into buying needless upgrades which are not upgrades at all.  I really resent spending a lot of bucks for a software the sole purpose of which seems to be to further the Intuit companies greed.  If zero stars were possible that would be my rating for this outrage.

ADDED LATER:  I have used this version now for about 8 weeks and find it even worse than my first comments.  It is unstable, frequently downloads inaccurate values for mutual fund shares, and the new interface is less user friendly than earlier versions.  I just wish I could have my old one which worked fine...back."
Norton does a great job as usual.  I am quite with it. Would recommend this product.  Will most likely use Norton products on 2015'
I BOUGHT GAMESXCOPY AND AFTER I BOUGHT IT I FOUND OUT IT IS USELESS DUE TO THE FACT THAT 321STODIOS WENT OUT OF BUSINESS AND YOU HAVE TO ACTIVATE IT THROUGH THEIR WEBSITE OR OVER THE PHONE AND THEIR WEBSITE IS GONE AND THEIR PHONE NUMBER IS DISCONNECTED.
just awful a don't buy I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH... YOU CAN NOT IMPORT YOUR OWN CARTOON AND ANIMATE IT ON THIS PRODUCT!!!
Love how easily this works. Have multiple computers and loaded them with no problem.
I'm not an accountant so maybe I don't understand. But I understand it a little better.
Have been using Norton 360 for the past four years and have been very satisfied. Have increased to five devices now within the household and the product is well worth the price.  Just have to look for the best price every year.
"New Rating: 1 star, update 2010-11-05:
I've lowered my rating of Win7 from recent use- last few months. Two additional items have driven this: 1. Despite having all of the latest drivers, Win7 Pro is unreliable. I've had it lock up at times, every other day, for no apparent reason, and have even referred to logs that didn't indicate a problem. And yes I've verified the hardware with test routines and I have an anitvirus running. 2. Win7 has a baffling interface that is worse than XP, which I didn't consider that good. Menus are spread around with no coherent reasoning. I have two other XP machines and Win7 is harder to use, reminding me of Windows ME. The only machines that have worked reliably-- and there has been some issues-- has been OS X machines (macbook pro, mac mini). After my experience with Win7, I am now looking at adding a dual boot system with Linux, since I'll still need an MS machine for a few programs. I think the basic problem with rating is that if you've only worked with problematic software, you come to expect it, or at least ignore glaring problems. Microsoft continues to make the same kinds of annoying software...

First rating: 3 stars
In the Windows realm, I've used everything from 3, 3.11 Workgroup, 95, 98, XP, Vista and now Win7. Win7 is equivalent to XP with a better gui but more bloat. MS has included the best of Vista while allowing one to tone back Vista's nanny warnings. My PC is setup as an HTPC. It runs pretty well with occasional driver problems but that's a catch-22: lots of vendors (s/w and h/w) making stuff gives you a lot of choices but the cost is occasional program freezes- not a complaint, just reality.

Overall I'm okay with Win7 X64, so why am I only giving it 3 stars? Because this OS makes incremental improvements on XP with a nice GUI that you never enjoy using. A lot of hardware and software is supported, and that along with XP's pending obsolescence are the two biggest reasons to buy it. In fact, all of the current mainstay operating systems could use fresh new replacements to be more intuitive, faster and easier to maintain, but backward compatibility limits, both previous user's familiarity and older program compatibility, limits what's possible.

Overall...
+ Better looking GUI than XP/Vista
+ Better security features than XP
+ Generally responsive
+ X64 bit support is good with a broad range of support for hardware/software
+ Power on and shutdown are faster than Vista, just 12 seconds to turn off.
- Not intuitive. If you do get a problem, google it- don't waste time on Windows help.
- Slow: Cold boots takes 70 seconds to Windows beep prompt, 1:30 until Windows Media Center (set to autoload) ready  w/ a 3GHz E8500 Core2Duo, 4GB & 7200rpm Medium-Fast SpinPoint SATA drive. Of course this would improve a lot with a SSD...
- Windows Media Center occasionally locks up even with all the updates.
- OS doesn't play well with others: Tedious to get it to do simple high speed transfers w/ other OSs."
"I've been using TurboTax Deluxe for several years now and I think it's great!  I had no problems downloading the product (Windows XP) or installing it.  The one thing I really like about it is the automatic update feature.  When I run the software, if there are any updates for the program, forms, etc., it automatically asks me if I want to download and install them which I do so I have the most current versions of everything.  Years ago I used to do my taxes manually spending literally hours filling out worksheets to see if I qualified for a particular deduction and how much I could deduct.  Having seen many TV advertisements for TurboTax, I decided to try it.  Boy oh boy, what a difference in the time it took to prepare my taxes.  I don't have a real complicated return, at least I don't think I do, but TurboTax found deductions I wasn't even aware of or that I qualified for.  If you can read, follow directions and answer all the questions honestly, I think TurboTax is the only way to go to get your maximum refund."
"I've used Turbo Tax for years.  This year, it won't let me eFile my state taxes (ID) and wasted my time repeatedly taking me around in circles.  It gave me a message that it couldn't eFile because there is an update to turbo tax, but there is none!  Now I'm mailing my forms and having to pay for a secured signature to insure my forms arrived.  I'll rethink using this software next year.  So bummed!"
works well no issues
"Yes, its slow, and they left out VBA support. And it not very stable, either. But the biggest problem I have with the new Office is that MS has once again managed to screw up copy and paste.

I've often used PowerPoint as an archive for graphics, text and equations. I paste stuff into it, and later, when I need it, copy it back out into other documents. I've recently discovered that in Office 2008, things go in, but they don't come back out.

For instance, you can create an equation in MathType and paste it into PowerPoint. It looks fine. But you can't copy it and paste it anywhere else. I was trying to copy it into Adobe Illustrator, but also found that you can't even copy it back into MathType to edit it. Wow.

You can copy text in PowerPoint, but when you paste it into other programs, it loses its formatting. This worked fine in Office 2004.

Besides the copy and paste problems, I've also noticed that some graphics seem to get changed to lower resolution when opened in Office 2008. These are from files created in Office 2004.

The one thing in Office 2008 I do like is the ability to import EPS files and display them. It was about time! But that feature alone is not enough to save this release."
"I definitely think WeatherBug Plus is worth the $$. I have used it for several years, and before moving, ran one of their weather stations. I have a problem with them in that they used to be able for station owners to put out alerts to our customers, and then they took that away. Also, the previous version is better than the current version. I like the ability to have ""My Stations"", but in the old version, when you clicked on one of ""My Stations"", you got the full details, just like that was your home station setting. Now, you get minimal data, and to get the full information, you have to actually make the other station your Home station. It's doable, but lots of messing around, when they had it so good before. Don't know why they changed it. Too bad. Apparently, they didn't know when they had a good thing."
"I received a version of the software that was for a Spanish speaking country. I only gathered that because of the Spanish on the back for the product code. When testing the number within the software I already head on my computer, it said I was not allowed to use the code since it was for another country."
QuickBooks OSS is the best and has made life so much easier!
I have the older Snood which works well on my Mac.  When I saw the new version for Mac OS X which I have.  I ordered it.  I have tried to load it on my computer but it will not load.  Major disappointment.
Got to love Amazon...got the exact same iLife '09 version as anyone else for $5 less!  Thanks again!
This app. is very useful. It's worth as it's free. Especially it's very handy for i phone to listen songs.
"Like virtually every music program I've tried over the past 20 years, this one suffers from having an awkward user interface for creating/modifying playlists.  I wanted to create a playlist of my favorite Christmas music. At certain times, the UI will let me select and remove a song but then pops me back to the top of the list and I have to scroll down and try to remember where I was to continue editing. No multi-select.  It's super easy to edit the name of the playlist - I go there quite often thinking I can edit the actual playlist.

Amazon ages items out of the ""free with prime"" list of songs. So, you'll find that a song that you could play last year isn't available this year. The app doesn't conveniently skip these but stops playing and you have to go deal with it."
I bought the Silent Spy for my granddaughter.  I think she has every one of the games that have been published and is looking forward to the next one.
"Moved from quicken essentials with no problems.  Some of the reports are not as good looking although the data is accurate. Overall, I'm satisfied with it."
great selection of music
This upgrade was not necessary if you have the pre latest  version. this was a waste of money nad time
"This software works as advertised. Clean install into my system(Windows XP Pro Service Pack 3), no problems with it at all. I am thankful, as other software sometimes is not as cooperative!"
"Is a very good product. I have used this in the past, recommend to anyone with multiple computers or devices!"
"This is my third year filing my taxes with Turbo Tax, and I have to admit I actually look forward to doing my taxes each year because this program makes  it so easy and fun. It walks you through everything step by step so you don't miss anything. Also, it tallies up your return as you progress along, so you can see how much you are getting (or if you owe anything, God forbid, it will show that as well). I chose this version since I have to file a state return, and the Deluxe Federal & State allows you to download their state program for free.

The only downside to using this program every year is the cost. You have to purchase a new program every year to get the updates. (Why can't they provide the option of downloading a few updates for old programs for a lower cost? It's all a money-making scheme, really.) On top of that, there is an e-filing fee. You would think filing electronically would be cheaper because it requires less paperwork, but it seems like Intuit just wants to make more money. However, the cost is worth the convenience of the product, so I continue to purchase and use the product year after year."
ok
"Worked great

Cheap way to convert VHS to DVD"
I've used Avast for several years and would never go back to Norton or McAfee ever again.
"I have tried many of the so called ""Clean up your PC"" type programs that if nothing else just installed mal-ware.. My laptop was on it's last legs and I thought i would give system mechanic a try it cleaned up my old PC and has maintained it for over 2 years. when I got my new laptop System Mechanic was the first program I installed on it. Fantastic Product!"
"I purchased MS Office 2007 for my home computer, having used it at work for a year or so. I like the features of 2007, particularly the graphics and capabilities in Excel. The one drawback, however, to 2007 is finding functions or icons for what you want to do. It is not that easy to figure out where they are"
I did not get turbo tax deluxe 2015 and I pay for it
"LOVE. THIS. PROGRAM. If I didn't use Adobe's Creative Cloud for things other than drawing, I totally would cancel my CC subscription for this program. The 3D models are so helpful for odd angles, complex poses, etc. I cannot suggest this program enough, and I have Paint Tool SAI, Photoshop/Illustrator, and have tried Painter (which, I do like, but not for things like sequential art or illustration), along with dabbling in several other programs. For just outright drawing, and the comic-specific tools, this is a great buy."
Old version.  Not a terribly relevant product now with the popularity of smart phone and expanding internet cell coverage with free access to really good maps from other companies.
"This Garmin SD International card is a wonderful device.  We were in some very remote areas, navigating back country roads, and it never failed us.  (we even used it for locating Geo-caching)
The directions to get it installed on our Garmin were clear and simple. It is very small, about half the size of a thumbnail, so it can be easily missplaced.  There is a lot to think about when traveling abroad and this took care of a major concern for us, especially in these two countries where road signs are few and far between.  We highly recommend it!!"
I have used TurboTax for several years now and find it to be very easy to use and the fact it pull info out of a previous return save me a lot of typing. It's deductible is a real help in determining the value of material good donated.
Did not need Outlook on this computer. This worked great for the application. I have used Microsoft office products for years and this excellent as usual.
"Just got the MacFonts and opened the package to find no printed guide. I tried to install the included software (FontManager), but it would not install on my newer Intel MAC. Got a message that said that the older software would not run on it. The description that Amazon gives says they are OpenType fonts. What it says on the package is that they are TrueType fonts. Not as good as OpenType.

I guess for the price, I should not complain, but it would be nice if they give you what is advertised."
Was glad to be able to find this for a a good price.
Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum by Roxio is a wonderful. Highly recommended.
"After ten years, Intuit lost me as a customer for good.  H&R Block was cheaper and just as easy to use."
"When trying a dictation program about 4 years ago, I found that product cumbersome and considered these programs a waste.  But, after reading many reviews of this product, I decided to give the basic version a try.  I am glad that I did.  While not perfect, I am impressed.  I am sure that as I continue to use the program I will improve.  From the beginning the accuracy has impressed.  If you had a poor experience in the past with this type of program, I suggest giving this Naturally Speaking 10 a chance."
"So far, so good.  I bought this for my husband and he has gone from chicken pecking to actual correct hand placements.  It is definitely doing its job."
"Like all Norton products, this works fine. However, it slows my computer down tremendously. It also will not run a complete system scan - it tries but never completes one.  It protects my system beautifully, but I don't like the slowness of my computer now. Norton 2009 ran quicker and actually worked better."
Thank you for the fast shipping and it is a great item with the right price.
"The download simply did not work. I tried a number of different procedures, but no luck. I liked the older product and wanted to update."
"It does not even work on my computer.  It will not work with any other keyboard other that the one that comes with the complete, plus nothing seems to work with Vista.  Do not buy this product"
if u ever wanted to make ur own game this is it
My old Quicken 2002 is still the best version that I have used. I have upgraded twice since and each version has been worse than the previous. Upgrades are supposed to be improvements. These have not been. I would not recommend this to anyone.
"Does not slow down your computer like other AV products and is always up-to-date via cloud based real time continuous updating.  Also, great tech support."
"Love this easy to use and follow program and I have used it and still use it often in making projects, custom frames and also gifts."
"This program provides basic anti-virus protection. It is a no frills program that installs easily. On the plus side, it seems to work and doesn't noticeably slow down the computers. I have had no issues with it as of yet but there are other programs with considerably more features. However, I have it running on my guest computers. They don't get considerable action so this program is fine for my purposes. The gamer mode is a plus. I require more advanced features for work. So while it may be no frills, it also provides neither thrills nor chills. And that is not necessarily a bad thing. It is simple and solid.  Recommended."
I purchased this product but could not install it because McAfee would not let me. They want me to buy the product directly from them. I am therefore asking for a refund of my money and I will return the card to you.
I love WordPerfect/hate Word.  This is just as wonderful as the older versions.  I have not had any problems with it.  Easy to install.
I wasn't able to find a program anywhere that could clean up a very dark video that was important to me.  I was able to use this program to do so very quickly and effectively.  Love it.  :)
"Excellent software,easy to use, and fun to play with. I made all kinds of video editing. Installs easy. Makes a great gift."
"Number ONE, I did NOT get the REBATE offer from Amazon as I had first purchased from Tiger Direct and NEVER recieved the software and UPS had marked package delivered.  I have had a problem with UPS since July 8, 2008.  I feel they are excessively HIGH in price and break down their services to INCREASE your purchase even HIGHER, which are ALL included with Panda Securities whom I left.  CA charges $19.95 for live Tech Support regardless if your problems began with installation at the beginning.  They have excorsed their customer service to India and you can hardly UNDERSTAND their aaccent!!!  I will go BACK to Panda when this expires as I could not even corner them on a REFUND.  They are OVER-PRICED and give pathetic customer service..."
I already had Corel Photoshop and the price on this made the upgrade a super buy.  Would recommend to anyone!
"Its worthless, utterly worthless. My father was born in Germany, and speaks the language fluently, having lived there 26 years. He watched me use this software and told me it is not going to teach anyone German. Don't waste your money on this software."
Great spreadsheets with many more facilities to the version I previously worked with.  Would recommend for keeping home records on.
"This software consists of many Spanish vocabulary & phrase lists categorized by subject.  Once you select a list, you learn via an interactive flash card program that provides four different ways of studying the words or phrases.  The program keeps ""score"" and will automatically show cards for words you need to work on more often.  A pleasant voice will pronouce the word or phrase for you as well so you can learn the correct pronunciation.

What is especially cool is that you can also create your own lists and add them to the program. The lists can be for ANYTHING you want to study and you can categorize lists by subject.  You can even record sound to go with the flash card and add hints.

I think this is a great Spanish learning program and the ""add your own"" flash card feature alone makes it worth the buy - especially for students!"
"have not completed the course, but so far very easy to understand.  The download was not as simple as expected, had to call customer support but they were very responsive.  Great deal compared to other courses.  Happy I ordered this course."
"I now own a copy of Microsoft Word that doesn't work, and a new copy of Microsoft Outlook that doesn't work.  The only screen that opens assures me that Microsoft will notify me when a solution is found.  About a year for Word and it doesn't work.  The solution is to buy an Apple.  I love my iPhone, maybe its time to stop throwing my money away."
"This is a great product, easy to use and a lot of fun. My daughter purchased this and the results are absolutely amazing!"
"I tried Intellisync with two different PCs, one a new Compaq.. to synch with my iPAQ 3670. The application never worked properly and worse yet it froze my PC three times. I followed the install and synch direction to the letter with the second PC but to no avail. Intellisynch did credit my account within 1 day however and were very nice."
Wow!!! The internet security works like a charm!!!
great product
Could never download it!
"I first have to agree with the prior posts that the updates LOOK great, & I really wanted to give this a better rating, but not all of the new features are working.  I downloaded this and upgraded from 2007 just for all of the new tax prep in it...and it doesn't work! I guess because it's 2009 it won't import Turbo Tax .tax files any older than 2008 (really?), it won't even let you manually enter your 2007 tax information into the tax planner (the drop down has an option for 2008 & 2009 only).  This isn't tax planning! This is crazy.  If you don't own any other version and you need it now or this isn't a feature you need (if you're buying this version I can't imagine you won't need it) then it's great...but don't plan on it being fully functional until 2009 I guess."
"was initially skeptical and had a plan on how to get a refund from Amazon if it wouldn't upgrade from a 5 year old non-PRO version of Vegas considering Amazon states it would, but I got the software and it feels like a full install it doesn't indicate it's an Upgrade Only anywhere on the package or documentation.  It included DVD Architect 5.2 and NewBlue Titler Pro all free, each with individual working valid serial numbers.  I installed Vegas 11 Pro and DVD Architect, and the new software is available on my <...> account as a full install, installed NewBlue as well, NO ISSUES.  I had a version of Sony Vegas Media Home 8 installed but sincerely, I believe this is a full stand alone install, there is no indication that this requires any other Sony Product on your machine while it's installing.

Go for it !!!!"
I feel more secure knowing ad avast is protecting my PC from all sorts of viruses
"I've used TurboTax Home/Business for several years and have always been satisfied with its performance and results. So I was incredibly concerned when I read all the bad reviews, all the problems, glitches, etc., that some customers are having. Whenever I see so many poor reviews, I take notice. So instead I decided to try H&$ Block software for the very first time. It loaded fine, no problems. However, I was amazed that it is nowhere near as intuitive as TurboTax. The import features from Quicken simply did not work (unlike the claims made by H&R), and I would've had to input just about everything manually.  Because I always seem to wait until almost the end to start fiddling with taxes, I simply did not want to go through the frustrations of having to do too many manual steps.

Thus, I held my breath and plunged ahead to order TurboTax Home/Business - taking a risk.  Well, it loaded as easily as it always has been. I was immediately able to import all my data from Quicken and from ItsDeductible site, plus import from other institutions, etc. After I corrected some errors on my part that I had made in Quicken, TurboTax gave me the results of my 1040 to review.  I must honestly say that I am thrilled and relieved.

No doubt some of the consumers who have had problems with it have legitimate gripes, and that can be extremely frustrating.  Intuit has been ramping up their products to be more expensive and less compatible with others every year. QuickBooks is a software that drives me totally nuts - it not only gets more expensive for a small business to handle the price of it, but also the fact that the software really has not improved very much in 20 years.  But that's another story.

I cannot address the complaints about e-file charges in TurboTax. When I got ready to e-file, I read carefully to make sure I would not be charged. I was not charged for the e-filing service.

I am sharing with you my experience - but please do not go by what I say. Like I had to do, you have to make your own decision on what may work for you."
Step by step clear tutorials. This is a great tool for learning Rhino.

PERRLA is so helpful! I am in my masters program and I am just now finding this gem. I wish I would have had this years ago.
"This does not include your state taxes.

You will be charged an additional $40.00 for your state taxes.

Do not buy this"
This product was a bit hard to load but I finally got it with help from my daughter. It is very easy to understand once it loaded.
"I have been a Turbo Tax user for years; and loved the product.....UNTIL THIS YEAR !!!!  I was informed half-way through entering my tax information that I would have to upgrade the Turbo Tax Software to the Premier Edition in order to complete my taxes.  The forms and schedules that I needed were not available in the Deluxe Edition.  Beware.....read all the fine print....if you can find it....???
I am now switching to H&R Block software."
"I got this mainly for central storage of all my files. More and more I find myself staying in the living room with my family and just using my laptop then going off into the spare bedroom to use my desktop which held all my files. But I do work from both, so getting files between them is a pain.

A simple NAS could have fixed that problem, but while shopping for them I saw some that had some interesting features like being able to access files remotely through a web address. They were extremely limited in this functionality though and lots of people complained that it didn't work well. One company even charges you a yearly fee for this feature. This eventually led me to the HP boxes which worked well and had good reviews, but their price tag scared me. I learned they just ran WHS which I didn't even know existed, so I looked into building my own. This was about the time they announced the WHS 2011 beta so I decided to wait for that to be released so I could have the most current version.

I took an unused computer with a dual core AMD Athlon II processor and 8 GB of RAM, put in a 320 GB hard drive, two 1 TB hard drives, and a 750 GB hard drive.

Installation was effortless and really not much different than installing regular windows. I always build my own computers so I was familiar with the process.

It broke the 320 GB drive up into two drives, one at about 80 GB for the operating system and the other at about 200 GB for storage (the other three drives I connected after installation).

I was able to set up the two 1 TB drives in a mirroring configuration for redundancy by going into the disk manager, you are not able to do this from the main Dashboard application. I just thought I'd share that it is possible if you have a little know how or you can search google for videos showing you how to do it.

Setting up the web access was pretty easy actually and I'm glad to see it runs under an HTTPS connection for free with no certificate errors. Best of all, it can stream your media files. I set the quality to 'best' since I did have a full processor instead of the Intel Atom's the NAS boxes run and the server could transcode video files on the fly just fine. My camcorder uses H.264 in 720p HD which windows normally chokes badly on, but the streaming worked right out of the box with them. The quality is not original quality, far from it, but good enough and will let me easily share with family members without putting them up in places like facebook where who knows when their privacy policies will change.

Client backups are very handy. I have mine setup to do client backups once daily. It will store the last 7 days worth of backups, then the last 4 weekly backups, and the last 6 monthly backups. That means it keeps the last week worth of backups, for older time periods it will dump the older daily and just keep one for the week, then dump the older weekly and keep a monthly. It will do a full initial backup, then it just keeps track of what files have changed between backups, and adds those files the changed to the backup. That means you do not need your backup drive to be several times the size of your client computers.

The backups allow you to roll back a computer to any previous backup. Find out you downloaded a virus 3 months ago? You can roll your computer back to a monthly backup before that. You loose 3 months of changes, but better than loosing everything. Hard drive crashed? You can reload your computer to the previous day and it will be exactly like it was the day before the crash. All your files, all your programs, all your settings, everything.

I only came across two problems so far.

1) It automatically created shares on the 200 GB partition for things like Music, Documents, and Movies. The problem is I already had folders for this on my 1 TB drives that use to be in my desktop computer. There was no way to edit the path for these share folders that were automatically created. You can move them, but not point them to a different directory. The work around is to remove the shares, then recreate them with the existing folders. A bit of a pain, and again this couldn't be done entirely from the main Dashboard application. An alternative would be to move the folder to the drive you want it on, then copy all your files over manually into the new one.

If you are not trying to install drives that already contain data, but are merely going to centralize all your files on the server this won't be an issue for you. Just move the share folder to the drive you want it on, and then transfer all your files over the network.

2) In order to configure a server backup, it needs an entire hard drive, it can not be included with any other files and can not be a smaller partition of a larger drive. I had originally intended to break the 750 GB drive into two chunks. One for client backups, the other for a server OS backup. Unfortunately I can't do that. 750 GB is a bit extreme for the OS backup, which is only about 60 GB... so currently I'm only doing client backups and not doing the server backup. Hope that dosen't come back to bite me. Hopefully in a future service pack they'll add functionality to that feature to be more flexible. The motherboard I have this only only has four SATA ports so it's full. SATA controller cards are rather pricy so I haven't looked into buying one much.

To add to server backups, the default is actually to backup everything on the server, not just the OS. You can configure it though (easily) to only backup specific things. In my case I was going to just back up the WHS 2011 OS, and the client backups (backup of a backup? Sure why not!).

Overall I'm fairly happy with it. I do not have virus software on it because none officially support WHS 2011 yet (some have announced they are working on it). I'm not too worried though, I don't work directly on the server and any files that get transferred to it will first come from the client computers which all have virus scanners. Putting a virus scanner program on it would amount to scanning the files twice, once on the client and once on the server. Redundancy is not a bad thing though.

There are several add-ons you can download for it, for disk management, power management, media libraries, etc. I looked into the power management one called Lights Out, looks cool to suspend the server when not in use to conserve power. It's not free though, so I'm looking into seeing if I can do it manually, I don't need the server on all night when I'm sleeping and don't want to go down to the basement to turn it on/off every day."
"I've used Fusion and VirtualBox, and have settled on Parallels mainly due to the graphics support it offered. I had trouble with screen scaling in the other programs. It is also extremely reliable and crash free. Last I checked it was also faster but it's been a few years."
"My granddaughters had already seen the movie, ""Brave"".  So, they really enjoyed this game.  It was a little harder for the 6 year old; but, her 8 year-old sister showed her the way.  We bought leapster explorer for the 8 year-old granddaughter 2 years ago at Christmas.  Every time she gets a quarterly report card which shows she's paying attention to her teacher and doing her best, she get's to pick out a game for her leapster!  She's getting straight A's and good conduct!  We decided to get our 6 year old granddaughter this same gift for a Christmas present.  If she listens to her teacher and tries hard, she will get a game each quarter too!  It's not about straight A's; but, doing the best you can do.  This means doing your homework and listening to the teacher.  So far, they are both doing great and they really enjoy the games.  These games also teach them spelling, math, puzzles, reading, figuring out problems, and other school lessons.  We consider this game along with the explorer as money well spent."
The only reason I purchased was for the ability to sink up quicken with my iPhone and or iPad. But it seems that this product was sold long before it was ready. the information I'm getting from Quicken is that is could take months to resolve the problem they have connecting with my bank (Regions) not a small or local bank! but to get the problem resolved at all they are expecting me to help with the trouble shooting by providing error logs!!!! REALLY!!!! I'm not on the Intuit Payroll! This work should have been done before releasing the product.. If you haven't already purchased I would wait e a year or so!!!!
Great
Product is probably everything it should be. I just personally caused havoc with it. OS updates are tragedies waiting to happen
"I was really dissapointed with this game. I bought it because I have a niece who is 10, and I thought that buying her this would give her hours of fun. It is nothing like the original. I was very bored with it, and so was she."
Works fine.
"I have to say that when I saw the price for the mobile me I thought ""this is terrible"". [...]$ for an email account? How crazy is that? I then signed up for the free trial to try it out. I didn't think I was going to use all of the features, but as it turned out the different things you can do with your mobile me account is actually not bad for the price. You get things all wrapped into one package that you would normally need to use multiple sites, services, and programs for. Can you get all of these things for cheaper from other sources? Sure you can, but then you have to keep track of your flicker, gmail, google calender, accounts separately, and even then you would need to keep all of the software together. Are you paying a price for convenience? Of course you are, but when you look at all the services mobile me replaces and the convenience of having everything in one place (not to mention the built in support for syncing on all macs and ipod / iphone mobile devices) the ""cost"" of the service really isn't all too terrible a price, and when you break down the pricing you are really paying [...] bucks / month for some really great services.

Pros:
1) Having all your email, contacts, pictures, web pages, file sharing, in one place.
2) Having access to all the stuff in #1 on all your mac (and pc) devices
3) VERY simple to use and easy to set up
4) Technical support and help if you have problems (Can you call Google to help you with email problems on your free service? Nope, didn't think so).
5) Easily share your calendars between all your family members at one convenient location using the same software.

Cons:
1) Price Price Price (although it is cheaper if you buy through amazon than auto renewal)
2) Does not sync with exchange or outlook using exchange (although I think this feature will be added soon)
3) Web interface is clunky at times, and you get that annoying screen about internet explorer when you attempt to use it to interface with the web client."

"This is a great manga program. Really makes your manga look like ""manga"" with all their tone options and the 3D models are great if you can't figure out how to draw a certain pose.

One problem though: Does not properly work with Windows Vista. Lots of missing strokes. I'm stuck having to now draw my manga in Photoshop and import PSD files into MS in order to be able to get anything accomplished. Very upset about this, I hope they release a patch for this or a fix or something. :("
"Attempted to install this on a Windows 7 computer that is less than 6 months old.  It was to replace the McAfee 2013 program I had been using.  The master installer would stop working, could not get it installed.  Contacted their ""Technical Support Team"", who spent 6 hours (that's right....6 Hours!) remotely trying to install the product.  All they managed to do was change so many of my computer's settings that I had to do a system restore just to get it back into operational status.  In the end, they told me I needed to contact Microsoft, and then try reinstalling.  For what I was supposed to contact Microsoft about, they never said.  I contacted their ""Total Satisfaction Team"", and all they told me was that it was a technical issue that I had to deal with their technical team about.  Even worse customer service than Dell, or, dare I say it.......Comcast.  I have to add that I have been using McAfee products for years without any issues.  After this experience, however, I will never buy from them again."
"I use Amazon music on my other two computers without any problem and today I thought that I would also install it on my Toshiba laptop.
Well, it installed just fine but it did not work on this computer.
While my music was loaded into the program without any problem, when I tried to play a song, any song, nothing happened..
So, I just had to uninstall it.
I would like to give the 5 stars because I really, really like it, I like the looks, the way is shows my music.
The interface is gorges, but it does not work on this computer running Windows 8.1 with 12 GB of memory and an Intel Core i7-4700Q CPU, 2.40 GHz."
Very basic. Does everything.....that a normal taxpayer would need done.  This makes 16 TurboTax years in a row that I have bought.  I have no complaints.

"Firstly, I had the Three User Version... Three PCs.

This programme  works superbly... once it is installed  fully.

I did all the prep  for XP  Professional, and the thing installed beautifully after about 7 or 8 trys. The thing that made it work was shutting down all things in services that could be shut down. SP2 in Windows XP pro is a pain.

Installing to my Windows ME  PC was a dream. Worked as easily as if it was a smaller app, and it did ALL of things that the XP Pro install eventually did.

Symantec need to work on this app a little to make things a bit more straightforward."
"Great map at a great price. Easy to route, Brazil coverage is simply amazing, Haven't tested it on Uruguay. I travel often for Unicef missions, I work for the Florida Hospital and these maps definitely do their job in a great way. I've been using them for 9 months and now I'm getting the updated version.

Customer service response time, extremely fast."
It does not allow to insert pictures and not easy to use. It is very basic. I was using another software but I bought a new computer and old software was not compatible and the new version of that software is more expensive (Nitro pdf pro) and I did not want to spend the money. IF you want something good spend more money to buy something that is easy to use and make sense
"Sony Vegas is a super tool; I lack sufficient superlatives to adequately describe my fondness for this program.

It's biggest strengths are it's audio capabilities, it's ability to mix resolutions and formats on a project, and it's use of multiple processors for rendering.  It handles multi-camera with ease and presents a very nice UI for cutting between cameras.  The ability to pan around a clip is awesome, and this feature is especially useful when incorporating stills.  The audio and video adjustment tools are great too; in audio you can easily adjust volume or change pitch.  In video you can boost the colors and lighten the ""touch too dark"" shots.  There's a RAM render preview that's just perfect for verifying a transition or checking timing.  The capture tools are awesome!  Each camera take is a separate clip, all done automatically and hands-off!  No mark in/mark out, unless you want to work that way.

I'm torn on the Media Manager.  On the one hand it's super because clips can be tagged and/or commented for easy sorting and grouping.  It has a nifty ""point to it to preview"" feature that makes finding a clip easier.  But it lacks thumbnail previews and a mechanism to see what's already been used in the project, so one ends up going back and forth between file views.

It's biggest drawback is that the Protype Titler is very slow, not intuitive, and generally has a clumsy UI.  Don't use .TIFF files either; if necessary convert them to JPEG in Photoshop and bring in the JPEG's instead.  And the DVD Creator is quite confusing and doesn't multi-thread, so creating a production DVD from a project can take considerable time.

Vegas does require a lot of computer power to run nicely.  We have a 2.4 GHz quad core on which it runs super.  One thing Vegas does well is adapt to lesser machines.  We previously ran on a 1.6 GHz single core and the program down-shifted where it needed to, making reasonable trade-offs.  We were impressed that junior high kids were able to produce a project using Vegas with about 20 minutes guidance.  Of course, there was considerable set-up required first, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend Vegas as one's first editor.  But if you're ready to take off the training wheels and get some real work done, Vegas is an outstanding tool.

I've run other tools and for me, Vegas is by far the best, most powerful, and most flexible."
Updates and functions much better than Turbo Tax Business 2011. I am very satisfied with this years edition. Imports data perfectly.
"This was purchased for my daughter when she was 7 months old - she really didn't grow into it until she was over a year, but at 3 1/2 she still requests it for some of the fun little games. I'm about ready to introduce it to my 14 month old son - It's great to have good beginner software out there."
TOO expensive
"great product, easy to use, helps to stay organized"
"Have used 360 for 6 years, and the only problem I have has has been getting the software to show the correct ""active days remaining"" after I load it. But that's generally solved by calling Norton and they make the correction. I guess it's partially my fault because I always end up buying and loading the new version before the current version, I have on my computer, runs out. Would think the software would be smart enough to add the new 365 days to the remaining 30 or so and give you a total. Not so, every time I load it early, before the old one runs out, I end up having to call Norton and they correct it. I guess if that's the only problem I have with the software after 6 years of use, I shouldn't complain."
Bought to try a different backup and recovery software-
"After 5 years you'd be hoping for more with this new Windows release.  It isn't revolutionary but it does smooth off many rough edges and generally feel more polished than XP.  It took days to upgrade XP due to incompatibilities etc, but having to solve these glitches forced me to learn more about the OS.  In fact I wouldn't have been able to solve some of the problems without the additional tools Vista offers.  I'm glad to say though that every problem I've had has been resolved by searching through the Vista newsgroups and everything is now working as intended.  If you're planning on upgrading your PC over the next 6 - 12 months, it's not worth the upgrade to Vista but if you aren't planning a HW upgrade any time soon, it's worth considering."
Great product
"Not to sound presumptuous, but I really love this product!  I grew up learning to type with this, and it doesn't get old.  I actually bought this for my dad to use.  Well worth the price!"
"Running on a Parallels VM in Mac OS snow leopard and definitely experience stability issues. I use the budget function heavily (upgraded frm 2011) and there is heavy update there, but geared toward the person who probably didn't use budgeting previously. (Eg, I aggregate personal expenses on multiple categories for multiple businesses I operate...usually by a journal entry in my primary checking account. This version doesn't recognize a net zero journal as a transaction and doesn't pull the category amounts into the budget actual numbers. Easy enough to work around, but a pain to update 5 months of daily JEs to get my 2014 budget to read properly.)
All in all, not the best intuit update I've seen, but certainly FAR from the worst (some of the POS updates in the last 5 years were heinous)."
TOTAL piece of Crap.  I was unable to install it and had no contact from Customer service.  Read the 1 star reviews to see that this is a consistent problem with this product.
:(
This is a great learning program but will only work on our old desktop pc. Wish they would upgrade this program.
I ordered a Easy VHS to DVD 3 PLUS but package delivered did not include the plus features and no way to get those features.

I recently purchased this item and when I received it the box said
dvd rom.  As my computer does not accept this, I retured it to Hallmark
with the note that was in the box that said if this was not compatible
with your computer that they would exchange it for a CD.  I returned it
over 3 weeks ago and have not received my CD.

I am very disappointed with Hallmark.  I tried calling them to find out
where my CD was and was put on hold for 45 minutes and 30 minutes another
time before hanging up.  I do not think I will buy any more Hallmark
product.  I will have to write to them since I have heard nothing re-
garding my exchange.

Would you please if possible check to see where my CD is so that I can
use it?

Sincerely,

Dorothy Phipps

This item was purchased on January 1st. As I have not received my CD, I
cannot give you a review."
There are awesome samples for any business.  It is easy peasy to use.  I love it.
"I admit I am not proficient in CorelDraw.  I drew up a hand drawn logo and was asked to make it a digital graphic rendition.  I am learning as I go there are a lot of objects in this Logo.  I was originally planned to learn to graphics on my own and just waiting for the vector program.  I have everything to do this endeavor but I also waiting for free time. A.  I got the job before I got the skill.  B.  CorelDraw exceeded my expectation.  C.  I had to buy the official Guidebook.  I am hoping to use this to draw my own comic book.

The video tutorials can be better.  I mean the instructions are done in Brittish English which is find but the narrator for CorelDraw is not that good and sometimes she is so breathless makes her hard to understand.  I find it easier to use the Close Caption to reinforce what the Narrator is being said.

I am not thrilled with the Cloud feature simply anything can be hacked.  I like the option of choice.  Perhaps when I have more expertise in the CorelDraw I would join the Cloud.  I am very proprietary with my artwork and I feel that the Cloud is too insecure.  It is reason why I resent Adobe.

It is not as good as Adobe yet and with some features it can be better than Adobe  It works well on Windows 8.1 and the 64 bit operating system.  I have a high end graphics card there had been no real conflict like Manga Studio 5 ex.  Especially when it comes to the fact Aero is not in Windows 8 systems."
cheaper than Turbo Tax and better
I love Turbo Tax 2014. It helped me step by step to get the biggest refund possible. Between state and federal I already have my 12 grand refund. I will only use Turbo Yax.  I bought Turbo Tax 2014 for my son and he is a student who works. He got a large refund and he is so happy about that! I would highly recommend this to anyone! The best!
I have used quicken for over 15 years and it has always worked very well. When I upgraded to 2013 the errors and perpetual frustration began.  At first all my split transactions since February duplicated.  After resolving and upgrading to the most recent release my paycheck started duplicating in the check register but double subtracting in the summary.  I now show a balance in the register tens of thousands of dollars higher than it should be and a balance in the summary column tens of thousands of dollars negative.  This version is clearly not ready for release and full of flaws that have now resulted in hours of frustration. If I could go back to the old version I would but cannot now that I have upgraded.  As a result I am stuck with a program full of 15 years of data that is worthless!!!!
"I have used Norton 360 for a few years and have never had any problems. If there are options you don't like, just turn them off."
"This software is just what I needed, works as expected and does a great job at keeping a lot of my computer house keeping chores automated. It is not very good for keeping spyware products off my computer, it needs help in that area."
Purchased while setting up a new computer only to find I'd been ripped off by spending $95 on an already activated key.
"I downloaded PC Matic from Amazon.  It is the best purchase I have ever made from Amazon!  I had used Norton the past year and it did not ""clean"" my computer.  It was running slow and after one scan the computer is running like I just unpacked it, like brand new.  PC Matic has done everything that they advertise, better than I expected!  I would recommend PC Matic to anyone who has a slow computer, freezes up, and takes for ever to open a browser.  100% satisfied!"
"I have yet to figure it out well enough to give anything more than 4 stars. It seems really good for the price paid and the purpose I have for using it. Simple to use and helps a lot in visualizing an idea. I haven't tried any others, but chose this one based on reviews. I have nothing negative to say about it as I have worked with it so far."
Been using AVG for years but now I need professional IT help to install.  From my internet research I have to use a removal program and cleaner program.  Guess I need to find an alternative.
I've used this program for years. Works for me.
I needed an older version of visual basic for some programs written years ago. I was glad to find this software and get quickly.
Honestly???.....really good!  i use it all of the time.
"After reading all of the previous reviews I was reluctant to upgrade from Quicken 2011, but I needed the automatic updates to make the product effective.  After installing the product and allowing the install process to install all of the new updates (R5). I had almost no issues when converting my data.  One of my hidden accounts had an incorrect balance, but I added a bogus transaction to zero it out and then hid the account.  I've been using the new version for about 3 weeks with no other issues.  I was prompted to install a new update and I did.  I was then getting some error messages when trying to open the application, but after re-booting my PC the problem was resolved."
"I used to work two jobs, where my Macbook was how I could maintain my own business when I was away from the office.  Trying to gain access to my Mac at home was a nightmare.  Remote access through some web services was getting very costly ($12 - $50/month) and the speed was horrible.  I also hated trying to remember to sync the files that were on a hosted disk.  I found out about remote access via Mobile Me (and easy access to file sharing), and have NEVER looked back.  Not only is access between my laptop and desktop seamless and fast, but I also can access my files anywhere without having to worry ""Did I sync this file?  Is the version on my laptop the most recent?"".  Who cares, just tap into my iMac at home and I am covered.  I think $99/year (I got the new version) was well worth it for me when remote access is a lifeline to my business and staying on top of things.  I personally don't use the sync for mail, but I do use it for contacts with my iPhone and that helps me a lot too.  Not sure why it didn't get better stars here on Amazon - but I do love it myself."
"Great product at a great price (at the time), however after the license was completed, they wanted to charge me almost $90 to renew."
"I really like the old version better. With this new one I can't get the page centered on my tablet -- it's off to the right because of the tool strip on the left. Can't use full page option because the bottom last line is covered with my tablets tools or apps bar. And some times it doesn't save my farthest point, and I have to try to find where I left off. I know I'll get used to these drawbacks but you should have left well enough alone."
was good. I think it was probably better than the previous one. you kind of of to know how to use it though.
"My 2014 version of Kaspersky has done a good job blocking malicious unrequested downloads from the web.  In a year I have had no problems.  However, I am giving three stars due to their new auto-update system.  When I first installed the 2014 version, I do not recall checking the auto-update box.  I learned years ago from a gym membership not to give anyone permanent access to my bank account.  Today I got an email notice about the auto-update.  I looked at the hidden sender address and it did not look like an authentic Kaspersky address.  I deleted it.  I then had a sinking feeling and did a web search.  Apparently this is the current Kaspersky routine.  They automatically renew an account with the new 2015 version weeks before the previous account expires.  The user loses time paid for on the existing version and gets the new 2015 version that is getting poor reviews on Amazon and elsewhere.  Now I have to decide to either go with the 2015 Kaspersky or talk to my bank to see if I can block the automatic update charge, and then switch to another anti-virus brand.  Kaspersky users who get an auto-update notice need to read it carefully."
I have been very pleased with this product. I was looking for a relatively simple program that would offer some more advanced photo editing. This product certainly fits the bill. It has been very easy to use even for someone who is rather technilogically challenged. The photo editing features are fantastic and fun to use. Highly recommended.
Would not copy what I wanted to copy.
"WARNING:
Norton 360 2.0 is an awful product.  I have a brand new hp pavilion dv6000 notebook with a windows vista OS.  I had heard some good and bad things about 360 but decided sine it stated vista compatible and I met the min requirements it would be fine.  BE WARNED AND HEED THIS ADVICE:
I purchased the 360 from Amazon.  It arrived fully packaged and sealed and once I installed it my entire system was seized.  Norton 360 was so bad it disabled my internet connection and didn't allow me to access any programs.  When I attempted to uninstall it it froze, furthermore it would not even allow me to go into my control panel.  When I went to my computer settings everything was blank.  After much ado my husband and I were able to acess the windows recovery system (during startup F11).  We backed up to a previous date (Pre installation) and alas the Norton 360 was removed.  However, it did not end there.  My wireless internet connection now ceased to exist.  However it was showing that all of the connections were fine.  After an hour phone call to HP the technician finally disclosed that sometimes Norton elements remain on the system.  Hidden from the naked eye.  He informed me eventhough we did a microsoft system restore as well as a recovery the trace could still be there.  He advised to go onto the Norton website and download the ""Norton Removal Tool"".
Once I sucessfully downloaded the tool and transfered it to my notebook, my system began working again.  Alilejua my internet is back up and all traces of Norton have ceased to exist.
So be warned Norton 360 may takeover your system like it's a virus itself."
"On TurboTax's site, ""Deluxe"" includes 1 state return. This one didn't so I didn't even think to read the fine print. VERY deceptive. Then, I had to pay through the nose to get the state return. What a sham! Very bad experience."
"This is an excellent course of Spanish. Based on my initial trials, I assume I am going to learn Spanish in a relatively short period of time definitely shorter than attending classes.

I received my purchase as scheduled without any delays.."
"Warning!  what you should know,it says runs on win 10, it will not! don't get it if you have the newest windows"
"We had Paint Shop Pro 7 and thought nothing could be better, we was WRONG.  The order and Delivery was great"
Perfect purchase in every aspect!
I was not very pleased with the game it didn't work as well as i was hoping. I needed to to help with math for my kids and the game crashed a lot or had to pay and was not really going to do that.
My two daughters 6 and 8 love this game. They play it constantly!  It is so much fun and easy to use.  I usually have to tell them to get off the computer.  My 14 year old niece was sick over Thanksgiving.  She asked me if she could use my computer.  I had barbie fashion show in the cd drive.  She started playing it and played it for about 3 hours.  I would recommend this game to any girl who loves fashion.  The only problem we had was when we tried to put it on an older computer that was running Windows 98.  It works great with windows XP.
"I purchased the download version of this direct from Garmin, which was explained as being the same thing.  So here's a newsflash for Garmin:  The Balearic Islands - Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza, etc. - ARE PART OF SPAIN and have been since the Greeks and Romans were there.  One of my destinations in Spain was to Mallorca, and guess what my Garmin GPS showed?  I was in the middle of water.  The Mediterranean surrounded me, no land anywhere.  The Garmin was therefore completely useless. Not that the large island was difficult to manage, but it could have saved me a one hour detour and a few other navigational headaches.

On the mainland it worked more or less fine.  Always a good idea to keep a detailed map with you, though, because the GPS directions can be off at times.  Best points:  Generally very helpful in big cities.  E.g., I had a Sixt rental car, and I was instructed to return it to ""Atocha"" in Madrid.  If someone just says ""Atocha,"" it means (1) the large train station on the southeast side of the city or (2) Atocha street, a nearby large road running up the hill of the old part of the city.  The car return location which the German company had designated as ""Atocha"" was a not well marked basement garage with a narrow, forbidding opening beneath a hotel off a very small plaza in an area of winding and twisting streets a long way from anything resembling ""Atocha"".  I had to call the Sixt help line, get the actual address and plug it into the GPS to navigate my way there.  (That's another hint for travelling in Spain:  buy a $20 cell phone with pay by the minute card installed which you can add minutes to at just about every gas station, roadside restaurant or kiosks located all over the large cities.)

This GPS was also helpful while on the road, especially with a Michelin in hand:  Look up out of the way restaurants, then cross check with the GPS's data base of restaurants, then hit ""go"".  It got me to a way cool 18th century farmhouse cum Michelin recommended restaurant in a semi-rural area which no way would I have found otherwise.

 I would have given four stars, but three since the product is misrepresented.  It is NOT complete for all of Spain when it entirely leaves out the very popular and beautiful Balearics.  I'm guessing that the Canary Islands are also not included.  Garmin needs to disclose those deficiencies."
"I was suprised at the unfavorable reviews.  I like this program and my experience is that other people find this program easy to use, too.
There is a great graphics interface that helps you keep your bearings as you work through your various tasks.  For example, it is easy to reprint checks or invoices, just pull up the form in the transaction journal and hit the print button.  The drill down capabilities let you go from your reports to the source of your information as well as it is a push of a button to put the report into Excell.
The inventory module is what for me puts this program on top.  There are features included that you would have to pay thousands for in other programs, such as multiple levels of pricing.  MYOB just leaves others in the dust.
Special note to MacIntosh users.  QuickBooks has dropped the Mac platform and given MYOB the lead.  MYOB is long time Mac ally and they are investing in the future with a new version that will take advantage of Apple's latest O/S.  I like that MYOB will run the same data file on both the Mac and the PC.
This program runs clean and nimble.  I recommend it."
I am very satisfied with this product.  It performs everything that it says it does.  This product opened my eyes to what my 16 and 13 year old are looking at on the PC. I was not to happy with the results but was able to provide good evidence when I confronted them.  They could not deny it.  The only problem I have with the software is that I can only access it from the PC that it is downloaded on.  I wish that I could access it from my laptop.  Other than that I would recommend this product to anyone with children  who use the internet.
"Nice addition.  I have a Kindle reader, Kindle for PC, and also for my Smartphone; therefore, I can read almost anywhere."
I am taking a Photoshop class right now. Some shortcuts are the same for this program but some are not. You wil have to play around to get use to everything a panels. But it works good and help with fixing some published photos I have.
"Easy to install, use and update. Excellent product."
I use this for animation DUH! and it can be better...a lot better in fact. I don't like the fact that you can only use 2 or less audio files and the bone rigging is TOO complicated and I do 3D animation and 2D on adobe software but for a beginner its sorta good but if I were a beginner I would take the big leap of faith because the bigger the risk the bigger the reward. I would recommend they make the bones less complicated and the software better in certain aspects. :)
"I used this a couple of times, when my PC broke.  Very helpful."
Good antivirus
no problem - works just fine.  very happy and satisfied
"I am not an accountant and QucikBooks is very easy to understand and use.
I live in a country with VAT and QuickBooks has a report that was easy to create and use.
Very pleased with the product."
Looked for a while to find the right substitute for Microsoft Money. This does the job!
Very happy with this item.  Just wish it had more editing features.  Other than that it has probably been the best VHS to DVD.  I can transfer on comp and do some editing with my other video programs.
So so. Didn't transfer some Federal numbers (Sch. C) to State. Had to go over return numerous times and check for errors.
I use a handheld Garmin on my motorcycle. This card turned it into a great motorcycle gps for cheap. It gives a ton of POI's and it has yet to let me down when entering a address.
"I pay $25 per year to have my music in Amazon's cloud.  I don't need the app at all, but Amazon requires it to upload music.  The new hangs on ""loading your songs"" and consumes most of the PC resources while doing so.  I've left it for well over a day and it hangs in the same state."
"I'll miss this product (used and developed with since 2003), maybe I'll be able to return to it next version but the ClearType font rendering in visio 2010 has made the product unusable for me (and others apparently -- google visio fuzzy fonts).  The new ribbon interface is another productivity killer.

The good news is you can download the complete product and try it (the font issues seem to be related to many factors -- hopefully your setup will work for you)."
You can't beat the price. Download was quick and easy. And considering the price of the anti-virus software they were trying to push on me in the store where I bought my PC-- this works great. No problems.
It was a great price o what can be so expensive. I am very satisfied; it works an removes any threats received..
"I had no trouble installing this on my computer running Windows 10. If you install it from the e-mail that Amazon sends after purchase, it works fine. You have to create an account with Norton to use their products though. As it was setting up my account, a few messages came across my screen that didn't make sense ""Your trial subscription is now expired, click here to renew"", but if you give it a second, it will all catch up and those messages go away without any action on your part. Eventually I got all green lights and was set up and ready. This really only took less than 5 minutes. There is one caveat that I was not happy about. Even though Norton says this product is compatible with Windows 10, it is NOT compatible with Microsoft Edge (replaced Internet Explorer). Norton will tell you that you must change your default browser in order to be protected while on the internet. Had I known this before buying, I would not have purchased this product as I like Microsoft's new browser and Windows 10. Never thought I had to confirm BOTH were compatible before purchasing."
No audits yet!
I've used Quicken for over 10 years and it does what I ask of it; but the changes for changes sake that permeate each new addition add very little utility and require a major investment of time to stay even.
"So far, I have been unable to use Restore successfully. This product has zero support from the manufacturer.
I'm quoting from the Acronis web site:
""Personal editions of Acronis products have a limited number of features and are usually distributed as part of a promo campaign. Support for personal editions of Acronis products is provided only through Acronis Knowledge Base and Acronis Support Forum"". Which means that it's impossible to obtain any kind of support from the company via a human being.
I certainly paid for this product, so it was not ""part of a promo campaign"". In my view, this is completely unacceptable. Both the Knowledge Base and the Support Forum were useless to solve my problem. I will never again buy anything else from Acronis."
"A few days ago, I installed Norton Internet Security 2014 (NIS 21.10.0.18) on XP and have had terrible performance problems.  I am running XP SP3 with 1.6 GHz processor and 2Gb of RAM--much more than the published minimum system requirements.

Specifically, my PC slowed to a crawl.  The slowdown was not confined to when NIS was doing scans or updates, but seemed to be more general, making my PC really unusable. Also, after installing NIS, it now takes 30 minutes for XP to shutdown.  Ouch!  The Norton user forum had a thread from another XP user with 1 GB RAM, who was also reported disabling performance problems, and wound up uninstalling NIS.

I disabled Identify Safe with no noticeable improvement.  Spent some time on the Norton user forum, where users pointed out a few other glitches that may pertain to NIS on XP, but couldn't explain the basic slowdown.  Several users suggested that I downgrade to NIS 2012, which they said is much better with performance for older computers, but the Norton chat person told me not to downgrade.

I have done one other thing which seems to have improved performance dramatically: I went into Settings | General | Other Settings and turned off all performance monitoring.  It's still taking 30 minutes for XP to shut down and I still notice some hitches in performance, but disabling the performance monitoring seems to make XP more or less tolerable again at least for the short term.  Forum users would not hazard any comments on whether disabling the performance monitoring would compromise NIS's basic security protection, but when I asked the chat guy about this, he told me ""That is okay that is under performance monitoring. And it will not compromise this computer security protection.""  I hope he's right, because I probably won't have time  to search for new security software for another few days at least, and in the meantime I do need to use my PC.

I might add that the Norton chat guy also said: ""No. You should not downgrade your Norton program. Hence, I suggest that your computer must be the one upgraded.""  Which leaves me wondering why Norton says that XP is supported by NIS 2014, when their solution to performance problems with XP is to suggest I buy a newer PC.

This is my first (and last?) venture into Norton.  I was running Kapsersky Pure 2.0 just fine until the license was due to expire and I only shifted to NIS now after seeing user reviews that Pure 3.0 has install and license verification problems.  I now plan to ditch the NIS as soon as I have time to research a better product for XP.

If you're running XP, save yourself the time and uncertainty, and skip Norton. Keep looking..and let us know what you find!

UPDATE ON JANUARY 3, 2014:
Since writing this review, I continued to have really bad performance problems with NIS 2014 on my old XP computer, even after disabling all the performance monitoring features.  On 12/15/13, I uninstalled NIS in two stages: 1) used the Microsoft Add/Remove software feature from the Control panel 2) after rebooting, used the special NIS removal tool which you can find on the Norton site. I then installed Kaspersky Internet Security 2014 instead. This produced a noticeable improvement in my old computer's performance, back roughly to what it was before the Norton debacle. Yes, it's an old PC and it's running XP so it's not speedy, but at least it's usable again.

I have indeed bought a new PC (that was my plan all along) and installed Kaspersky Internet Security 2014 on that as well. KIS installed easily to my new PC (Windows 8, i7 processor, 8 GB RAM) and is running just fine.

Goodbye--forever--Norton."
I'm happy with this product.
"This is the first game I was able to play with little help from a walkthrough. My family has two computers: I played this game on mine and my 8yo and 12yo played it on theirs. It was fun to be able to help each other when needed.

The game does get a bit creepy in some scenes, but my kids loved the bird. The puzzles weren't too difficult that they couldn't be solved. Jane's games were also fun to play with. The best thing about that is when you got stuck, you could take a break at any time and play a game with Jane (when she was awake and not studying).

It was also interesting how certain scenes were shown on my game that weren't shown on my kids game and vice versa. Sometimes the same scenes we saw on the different games would be shown at different points in the game as well. For example, in my daughter's game she saw both nightmares, whereas I only saw one. She also got scolded by Jane's tutor early in her game, while I got scolded late in the game.

The graphics were slightly better than the older Nancy Drew games and the music was not so ominous. While Nancy's friends weren't there to help, web browsing on the cell phone helps a lot with many of the puzzles. There is also a little bit of comedy in the game: Polly always has something witty to say and you also get to scare Nigel in the library.

Overall, this game is great to play with your kids."
not understanding this cd but I will figure it out
"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Microsoft 2008...

The Good.  It is now Universal Binary - if you have an Intel Mac, you'll see a major speed improvement - Office 2004 was dog-slow on my Intel Mac (2.4 GHz Intel Core Duo 2 MacBook Pro) due to the need for Rosetta translation.  Initial start-up of all the Office 2008 programs is still very slow - maybe even slower than Office 2004.  Once open and running, the speed difference finally becomes apparent.

The Bad.  Many features went out the window.  If you use Office special features, a lot of them are no longer available.  Some of the features I noticed that were missing include: Visual BASIC, some macro functions, Data Analysts Toolpack (from Excel), and PowerPoint does something to the graphics (I think it changes the format altogether) so you can't do any editing after you enter them into a presentation.

Functionality.  I was hoping that this version would include a lot of the functionality that the Windows version has - Outlook features especially.  I am looking at giving Apple's Mail program another try to see if it is worth using it as well as the integrated Calendar and Address Book applications instead of Entourage.  Pre-Leopard, Apple's Mail program fell short - it is hard to beat Entourage's all-in-one mail, calendar, and address book functions.  I haven't tried the new version of Apple's Mail yet, but I will give it a try in the near future - when I have time to convert all my mail files.  I also noticed Microsoft still hasn't fixed bugs from Office 2004.  One big bug to me is if you copy or cut something, then start Office and try to paste it, you can't - Office doesn't see it.  You have to have Office open before you copy text or graphics in order to paste it into an Office document.

Entourage Files.  One poor design of Entourage is everything is contained in one large Entourage data file.  Apple's Mail program uses many small files - one for each folder and a separate data file for contacts and for calendar events.  That way if a file gets corrupted, you don't lose everything.  Also it is better for back-ups.  With Entourage, the whole file (mine is over 1GB) has to be backed up even though little has changed.  With Apple's Mail program, each folder is a separate file so if you store a lot of old emails, you only need to back up the folders with newer mail - a hundred KB instead of a GB.  Saves a lot of room on your back-up drive.

The Ugly.  I don't like the major interface change.  It is not as intuitive as Office 2004 for Mac or Office 2003 for Windows (Office 2007 for Windows has an interface similar to Office 2008 for Mac).  It is like learning Office menus all over again.

Bottom Line: If you have an Intel-based Mac, it may be worth ""upgrading"" to Office 2008 for the Universal Binary feature.  If you have a PPC Mac, stick with Office 2004.  Sometimes I wonder if Microsoft intentionally holds back the development of the Mac versions in an effort to try to switch people from Macs back to Windows.  The year-old Windows version is superior in many ways to the Mac version.  And Office 2004 is superior in many ways to the newer Office 2008 version."
"Easy to install, and hasn't slowed my computer at all.  I definitely prefer it over Norton, simply because Norton has caused me some headaches in the past.  So far, this works well on my computer (Windows XP).  The scan takes about as long as Norton's did, and it blocks sites well.  I've only used it for about a month, but so far I'm very happy, and glad I have an alternative to Norton.  The price is great as well!"
"I originally played this as a kid when it first came out. I was a little too young for it then (9 years old), and my younger brother who was 5 had nightmares. Long story short, we never finished due to our fear of being eaten by these ghost dogs.. So -- if you've got little children, this may not be the game for them.

HOWEVER, I played this with my brother (now 18) when I went home for Christmas from law school, and we had a blast! Classic ND puzzles that intertwine with multiple layers of problem solving.  It's a games that, in my opinion, is best for those 12+. The graphics are cool (keeping in mind this was released in 2002), and the story line is PHENOMENAL! Great history references with an intriguing plot."
"As a long time Quicken user, it's an invaluable tool.  I use it all the time.

But, the improvements between versions aren't that important to me.  Graphics are a little nicer, it's fun to see a new interface.  I'd rather not have to rediscover where my favorite parts of the program have been moved to.

So, I wouldn't bother with the upgrade, except that I like to download transactions from my online accounts.  After a 2-3 years, our friends at Intuit change the file format so my old copy of Quicken won't download transactions.  It's obviously a way to force loyal clients to upgrade.

This time around, I was in sticker shock.  Quicken is how much?  At least twice as much as my last upgrade.

Looking for a deal, I discovered that last year's version is half as much as this years model.  I've installed the software and life is good."
I thought it worked with gs system.
"I have been using H&R block for years to do my taxes, so I am familiar with their way of doing things.  Not sure if it is better or worse than others because I have not used another program that I could compare it to."
"I am sorry I bought this.  I had tried a previous version before with no success. I was hoping this time would be different, but it was not.  I was trying to go from XP to Windows 7.  I ended up having to do a fresh install and reload everying manually.  I won't ever use this product again."

"My son, who just turned 10, and is gifted in Math *loved* this.

The first couple of CD's were reasonably easy, but he is now getting challenged in the CD on Algebra. I'm happy that he tries to do several problems each day on his own, during his summer vacation. The problems have hints, and if you get it wrong thrice, it shows you a ""secret file"" with the full solution. He's pleased with the pictures, sound & video effects etc, that make this much more engaging than doing problems from a text book.

As a parent, I like ""EduTainment"" software, and am pleased the software generates a complete progress report. The software is based on Flash, so works on both PC's & Macs. My only minor complaint is that there seems to be a lack of background music choice, which is limited to ""new-age"" type.

Overall, I regard this as a great investment, (esp. compared to the hourly cost of math tuition), that will serve him well of a couple of years. (CD states it's meant for grades 6 thru 8)."
"I had a very frustrating experience last year using the other widely-promoted income tax software program. This year I decided to try H&R Block instead. My initial introduction to the program was a little shaky because it was so different from what I had been using for years; but once I got into the flow, I found myself liking it more and more. I was able to manually enter data drawing from my Quicken software, and everything went in without a hiccup. Where I was not able to file electronically last year (for who knows what reason), this year's filing went straight through. The filing was accepted; and although I have not yet received my refund, that would be the only possible concern still to be faced. If any problems arise with the refund or with the calculations in my filing, I'll add a footnote to this review. As of today, I very happy with H&R Block. I also find some assurance that, if I have a problem  with my filing, I will have access to a H&R Block tax preparer to assist me in resolving disputes."
Really a great way to get a good look for your buisness. It's low cost makes it a greater starting point for the small or new buisness owner.
"I've found this to be good protection; I've had no issues with it.  Windows 8 can be a bit fussy with it, though (but Windows 8 can be fussy with many things).

I don't prefer this to Norton, necessarily, but I don't dislike it."
very good
I bought this to make a quick and easy will at home. It arrived on fast and was easy to install and set up. It took less than an hour and i had everything set up. It saved us a lot of money on hiring and attorney.
"Could not get product code to work, spent 1 1/2 hours on phone with agent who was very difficult to understand.  They then scheduled a time to call back because they had no clue how to help and two days later they have never called.  A total waste of my time and money.  Will NEVER purchase again!  I am going to ask for a refund!"
This product has come a long way but falls short on expectations. You end up spending more time correcting the errors then if you just typed it out in the first place.
"*** UPDATED 5/16

- After reaching a HIGHER UP at Avanquest, I was referred to several techs who had me try different things, yet the issue STILL could not be fixed.

This is a great BASIC Web designer.  However, beware that you may experience the same issues with startup especially running Vista.

I am looking forward to se if the next version is any better.

You will notice on the Avanquest Support Forum that there are MANY users having a problem where after the 1st reboot of their vista machine the software no longer retains your serial number.  You have to enter it each time over and over.

Emails to tach support go unanswered with nothing but reply messages saying someone will get back in a day.  But nothing happens at all.

This product alsmot can be considered abandonware with this type of support.  All I want to do is USE it, and the sewrial number issue continues to happen.. (not only to me .. to many).

I can't comment on the features since I haven't been able to properly get it started!"
"I cannot find a single new feature in this version except the credit score (compared to Quicken 2013).  And not even that works.  I repeatedly entered my correct information and was told it didn't match Quicken's information.  Worse, the auto update repeatedly freezes and I have to use task manager to kill the Quicken thread.  I can only imagine that this will corrupt my data file sooner or later.  Then, when you reopen, everything works ok.  I've also noticed in this version that you can no longer cut-and-paste anything in any register entry field!?  In addition, when you change the amount of a split transaction and it prompts you to adjust splits, if you hit enter, the focus is on the FOLLOWING transaction and it throws an error instead of opening the current transaction to modify the splits.  It's things like this that make me wonder if they test their product whatsoever.

I'm learning to despise Quicken.  I've been using it for over 20 years and it keeps getting buggier.  The testing and quality control is miserably bad.  They never go back and fix existing issues.  Normally, you expect to get at least the same experience you had in the previous version (with the bugs resolved).  But instead, they don't fix old bugs and keep introducing new ones.  Their support organization is also miserable.  It's based in India and the people on the phone typically have no idea what you are talking about.

This upgrade was a free $50 gift to Intuit for absolutely nothing."
I just purchased my PDF Converter for using on Microsoft Word. I have converted all of my legal texts in about 1 hour. This represents several hundred pages of documentation. Have reviewed for mistakes but could not find any. This works better than anticipated and will save thousands of dollars in man hours. Wish this would have been released sooner.
"Had to upgrade from Office 2002 when I upgraded from Windows XP to Windows 7.  Office 2010 is somewhat confusing at first, but works ok."
Very satisfied!!
"I have used turbo tax for years now and have always found it relatively easy to use.  And I hate working on taxes, afraid of making mistakes.  This eases that stress!"
"This is a great fun way for the kids to learn to type.... I gave them a high goal for every test, so they repeat it until they have it down packed..."
"I was very skeptical about buying a tool that essentially does what I can already to with the Alt+PrintScreen key in Windows. Boy was I wrong! After downloading the trial of SnagIt from the TechSmith web site, I purchased it the very next day. SnagIt is so much more than just a capture tool that you have to use it to appreciate it.

I create tutorials both for the books that I write and for the ones I share on my web site. I have spent hours in my paint program adding arrows, circles, and text to my screen captures. When I saw how easy it was to create consistent looking annotations in the SnagIt Editor in just minutes, I was sold. The productivity gains were well worth the price. I also love the ability to capture a scrolling window like a web page, and the ability to capture graphics as text. The latter makes documenting menu items very easy. Here is a <a href=[...]>tutorial</a> I did with SnagIt the first day. All of the modifications to the screen captures were done with SnagIt Editor.

If you do a lot of screen captures and annotate them, download the trial of SnagIt and see for yourself. This is an amazing little tool that you'll soon wonder how you lived without."
"I've been using H&R Block since they first started producing software to file from home and I still swear by it.  It's not only much easier than the rest, but one year it calculated a larger credit for me than a certain other popular program did.  Turns out the H&R Block calculation was the correct calculation, and I've been sold on it ever since."
Luv it!!!!
"This is the worst software I ever spent money on. My brand new, working fine before 360 computer along with my laptop which is 2 years old was so bogged down with this software. It took simple task like opening files
estimate of 15-20 min. just to open. I also called for help "" I was on hold long enough to cook dinner for a family of six. When they finally
answered I could barely understand what they were telling me to do at which
time that didn't work. I uninstalled ""ALL' Norton's software went with another form of protecting. Norton 360 trashed it.
""BUYER BEWARE"""
Terrible! After keying in all the data could not even use it.
easy peasy.
"Thomas Lang is an incredible drummer, one of the best in the world. The lessons in this series are not easy, they are not meant to be...but it f you want to become a better drummer, this will definitely help you improve coordination, stick control and reading."
"After using TurboTax for many years and learning that Intuit decided to gouge us this year, I decided I would try H&R after reading good reviews here. I have stocks to deal with so I picked up Deluxe with state option.

The install and import from TurboTax went well. H&R follows a similar but less intrusive and annoying interview process than TurboTax. They make it easy to get to help and learn relevant information related to the current topic. H&R also has a smoother interface between the actual forms and interview process as well as an easier way to navigate to the various interview processes.

Importing data from employers and brokerage was easy but a bit confusing as they also have last years imported entries as well. I finally get to my first real issue and that was validating my 1099-B's. They have one check box for Box 2 'Type of gain or loss', well box 2 on a 1099-B is actually 2 check boxes, one for Long-term and one for Short-term. Being a software developer I understand that you really don't need 2 check boxes to indicate whether this is a long or short term gain but H&R does not say either way, it's just not possible to know when to check this box.

So I called support on a Saturday morning and after a bit of tag with a computer voice I was quite surprised to be talking to a real person. The surprise quickly ended as the person on the other end had little knowledge of the product and really could not understand the issue at hand. After 20 minutes of somewhat unprofessional support I decided I had enough and would make a guess as to whether item 2 should be checked or not, look at the forms and then determine if checked is long or checked is short.

After figuring out the 1099-B issue I finished up the federal with no other glitches. Now on to state, I was prompted to download my state package, which is Indiana. I live on the border with Kentucky and actually work out of state where Louisville has a local tax that all workers must pay.

All is going well with the state, then we come to some schedules that need dollar amounts calculated. The only thing that H&R does is say to follow the directions to calculate. They provide no direction so I next spend 30 minutes getting specific directions for this calculation by downloading the directions from Indiana's web site. I'm not pleased to have to do this as this is a big reason for buying software.

After moving on I then note that my refund calculated so far looks rather high and after doing some math I determine that H&R has incorrectly summed locality withholdings, it has included the Kentucky portion with my Indiana. It's 10PM on a Tuesday night and the house is quiet so I decided to try the online chat, after 1 hour of, 'we are busy'  and 'we will be with you in a moment' I have someone on the other end. After telling me to try so many things that I knew was just wrong they finally told me how I could override the actual W-2 value that was pulled into the state form. This process took 49 minutes and was the most unprofessional interaction I have ever had with any customer service, I will say that this person should be fired.

I didn't note while on the chat that the software tells you when you override a field that you cannot efile. No big deal it will save me the additional $19 efile charge. I get to the final accuracy check and I am told my W-2 locality entry does not have a state marked and that I need to go back to the federal section under W-2 and fix this. I know the issue is related to the out of state local tax entry but after 30 minutes of trying I am unable to resolve by myself.

This is where I am right now I think I will just cut my losses and do my state by hand, it will probably be quicker and less painful than dealing with the horrible support that H&R has provided."
"Product met all expectations.  I needed this
version to be compatible with many files I
currently use. Price also met expectations."
"Needed to get new anti-virus software. Already had Trend Micro so went shopping. Local bigbox store had it but pricy. Company web site had it but pricy. Last minute I checked AMZ -sure glad I did. Pkg arrive quick, installed just fine. Great buying experience."
SO NICE !
"Turbo Tax is on a death spiral for me for use on the Macintosh. This year requires you to have an on-line account to be able to password protect your file. What this means is that you can't even open your tax file unless you are on-line. Note that this only applies to using TurboTax on the Mac, the PC allows you to password protect locally.

Unacceptable behavior from Intuit. If I wanted to use an online product instead of a CD I run locally I would have selected their online offering."
"I don't understand why there is so much hate for Windows 8. I'm on the desktop most of the time and forget the metro UI is even their. When I do go into metro I can easily find all my applications listed in alphabetical order. All my games run smooth as well and some even better than on windows 7 (for me anyways). Specs are amd fx 8350, sapphire r9 270 dualx 4gb version. 8 gb 1600 mhz,  Asus M5a99fx R 2.0, Seagate 1 tb hdd."
"MS Office Home and Student 2007, great value and 3 user licenses too.  Only problem is that less than 2 weeks later, 2010 MS Office download offered free with purchase of MS Office 2007"
"Works perfectly for me, does exactly what is advertised. Tested it a few times with online programs and websites. Keeps out the novice internet dwellers and websites trying to get information. Probably will not work against government or any hacker actually trying to get your information if he really wants it."
"I had some trouble initially and asked for support: I got answers to my emails after only few hours. At the end the problem was in the Outlook installation and I only needed to restore it. But their support was rapid and effective.
The tool is running perfectly now, I suggest it to anyone who needs to keep Outlook Calendar and Contacts alligned with his Android mobile."
Couldn't have done without.  It is about the same as turbo.
Not very friendly to work with. I doubt a novas would get very far without much frustration. Hope newer versions are better.
Works with Win7. Seems less buggy than previous versions. An old standby for me.
"This is generally useful software for managing one's checking account and tracking categories of expenses. I don't find the interface to be at all elegant, and there are some little glitches, but it works overall."
"This is a very clever and very easy way to learn Greek. I can't believe the vocabulary I have learned since using it only 3 weeks. I am commited to this product and wish when I was younger there was somethng like this on the market.

It is actually fun doing the exercises and my Greek born husband is so proud of me!"
"Thankfully I got this for practically nothing through a special Amazon offer. This needs to be upgraded. I used the other print shop for years, but now with Windows 10 they don't work. Too bad Encore doesn't care about their customer's feedback. Maybe they're going out of business. IDK"
The CD didn't play correctly. Waste of money.
"The software is great, It works as well as filing my taxes online with the website."
"It is excellent.

The graphics are wonderful. The Learning&Training Area has so many ways to improve my chess game; from learning from puzzles.

It will post analyze the games I played.

Help me during games with hints etc.

You can watch games. Even has a fun area for kids.

I can play the rating games where I can't get help or hints so I can see what my rating really is!

The list is long on the many ways you can change settings.

I play a few games and from my skill level I found the games challenging and the opponents realistic.

The game was sent very quickly and package good!"
Keeping my computers safe!
"The process started with 4 1/2 hours to install this program.  Next came the email issue--which took hours more to set it up.  It essentially took an entire day to install and set up, occupying the computer and rendering it useless for any other tasks.

My husband is STILL complaining about the damage wreaked on the laptop by this security software. For experienced users, this was way over the top in terms of its invasive nature and slowing of the computer.  It undoubtedly prevents any kind of invasion from the outside world, largely because it nearly severed the connection with the internet because of how it slowed the system down.

It cataloged and re-organized his email too--deeming most of it as ""spam"", regardless of what his original sorting of it really was. It marked every single ""safe"" sender in Outlook as spam, and completely erased all of his gazillion rules managing the email. It also stopped future downloads of email into Outlook until the software was removed from the computer.  It also eliminated all RSS feeds.

It completely prevented working on websites--it regarded everything as ""malicious"" or ""suspicious.""  (For the record, this was a laptop with a dual core processor running Windows 7 Ultimate x64.)

All in all, it lasted a week.  It was a disaster, and two weeks later, he still rants about the havoc.  It was not easy to remove either, leaving traces of itself in many locations, resulting in a lot of ""clean up"" work being required, in addition to the time fixing Outlook.

On the plus side, for inexperienced users who don't work on websites or manage mega-email, it's easy to use and seems to do the job it is intended to without disrupting their surfing, email, and other typical tasks.  It has to be set on moderate or minimum security level in order to work.

We've used McAfee, Norton, Trend, NOD32, AVG,and BitDefender in the past, in addition to Microsoft's Security Essentials.  We have never had any security suite wreak this much havoc or be this much of a problem, on ours or anyone else's computers.  We've liked some and disliked some, but this has been ranked as the worst software decision we've ever made.  According to my husband, the only thing worse would be Windows 98 running an AOL browser.

There are better products on the market than this one."
"I recently upgraded from an older version of MacGourmet Deluxe to version 4 and like others, I had some difficulty transferring my recipes to the new format. The support staff was awesome. Matt replied to my email very quickly and Teresa worked with me over the phone a couple times and then when I was still struggling, she just had me email my database to her. She did the conversion for me and emailed it back with easy instructions for loading it. She responded promptly and was always courteous. I highly recommend this software because while it is great, the people behind it are even better."
"I've used TurboTax for about 5 years now.  In the past, I've really liked it but the product hasn't kept up with the times.  They are still writing the exact same product they wrote for Windows95.  This is 2003, Windows XP has been out for 3 years.  TurboTax refuses to run except as an administrator which means you need to open yourself up to virus attacks to use it.  It also refuses to save its files somewhere normal like My Documents but rather insists on saving them in Program Files.  Uggh!  TaxCut is looking better and better all the time."
"I have this package on my MacBook. I would say, if you are doing complex media work like brochures or stuff like that, it is superior to other stuff I have seen.

But I have to say, after buying this for about $ 80 at the Apple store, and then downloading NeoOffice (a free open source package), I have to say that for the things I do (basic word processing), that NeoOffice is far superior.

One example: format copying on NeoOffice is easily recognizable as a broom icon. I still can't find a similar function on Pages, even though I have used Pages for about 4 weeks. I also could not find out how to change the language of a document in Pages. Pages is just too complex, and I have to say the NeoOffice and OpenSource beats it."
"They monitor your computer, even if you don't want them to.  They deactivated my program because my first computer died and then I put it on a second computer.  They said some crap about being only able to use it on one computer.  Never buy this or nything else from this company."
I do not I offer good protection
"I have been using turbo tax to file my returns for past 3 years.  This year, I went to turbo tax site to select the proper version.  The Basic version only does 1040EZ.  You own your home, then you are required to buy Deluxe version which is $44.95.  Deluxe version does not include investments, so if you are invested in stock market, now you are looking at Premier version for $74.95.  I used to get all my tax done with $20 basic version.  Now I am looking at spending $74.95.  I own my home, invested in stock market, and was able to do 2006 tax using Basic version last year. Be warned that the 2007 basic version turbo tax is useless, and you would need to get least 2007 Premier version this year if you want to itemize."
Only issue I had was when I tried to file state return it wanted me to pay to file it.
"Bought this for my boyfriends 2015 toyota camry le, shipping took a while it arrived in good condition. He loved it however it wasn't big enough to feel in all the sidee of the front windows theres  a bit of a gap."
Takes little of the processor to run it. Updates silently as it should. Never any issues running with Kaspersky
"I'd love to give this product a 5 star review, but I can't. It arrived damaged today. It has some sort of permanent markings....look like fingerprints, as well as what looks like white paint. It appears to be a quality control issue. It is obvious they are damaged, but they are packaged anyway. I imagine they only look at so many packages to see if they're ok, and this set was missed. I have re-ordered as I do like the product. They are a nice weight of plastic, not too thick. They come with a great set of a variety of labels (you could do a k-12 school album with the grade labels)  which are nicely done. I've contacted Amazon for a replacement/exchange as they'd be useful in other scrapbooks, not just for Project Life. If the next set is perfect, I'll update this review."
"I have been a loyal user of Turbotax for many years coming to them from Macintax. I've used the Deluxe version for as long as it has been available (at least since 2007 if not earlier) and have been pleased. So I ordered it again this year and was dismayed when I came to start Schedule C and the program said I needed to upgrade to Home&Business for $40. While the product description notes that the Turbotax lineup has changed, I don't think that notice and the product comparison chart did a good job of indicating how significant the changes are. While Deluxe can still be used in Forms mode to fill out Schedule C, I don't believe it will support e-filing. I think Intuit made a mistake by not retiring the Deluxe name as other reviewers have noted.

As I read the negative reviews I noticed that Bob Meighan, a VP at Intuit, was responding and in many instances encouraging reviewers to contact him. So I contacted him as well and I'm happy to report that he listened to my concerns and found a way to keep me a satisfied customer at least for this year. Whether I will continue as a Turbotax customer in the future is not yet clear to me. Home & Business costs $79.99 and my return is not that complicated. Intuit will have to think carefully about their pricing structure next year."
Pretty good with amazing price. Both registration and installation is of smooth process. I installed on my 4 Windows PCs so far. All looks good.
"On the surface, its a great product but obviously their firewalls are not what they state as our identity was compromised and we were victims of tax fraud."
"This was my first eBook experience and I love it. I love the fact that I do not have to write notes, b/c I can highlight, copy, paste, make note cards/flash cards. Also, the search too is amazing, I can just type in any word and it will take me right to the page. This was more than helpful when I was taking a timed open-book test. The best part is that it was available to me from any PC, phone or anywhere really I wanted to log in from and it remembers where I left off even without having to use my book mark tool. I can even have it open on my PC and my tablet or phone at the same time. Since I really a last minute kind of a person it works out for me that I purchase the book the day before class starts or the day of and I am not going to fall behind in class b/c I don't have to wait for the actual textbook to be delivered to my home. This made my life much easier and I do not have to carry a or multiple textbook around in my bag anymore."
Love it for manipulating pdf files.
"Horrible, error when typing in the Secure Keycode and stayed on hold with custumor service for over an hour without ever getting to a real person.  Don't waste your money on this!"
"It's a good product, a little hard to find the help I was looking for, so I had to go to my office and try some ""blog"" answers although I really don't do social networking sites at all, since I have no trust of them.  I did find an answer but have had little opportunity to use the program.  It seems to be working in a smilar manner to the one I use at work, although, of course, it's not completely the same."
Good stuff!  Fast service.  Thank you!
"I've used Nero products in the past, but it's always been those free Nero burning software that comes bundle with the computer and has limited capability.  This is my first full version of Nero I purchased during the Amazon lightning sale and it's well worth it for $29.99.  It does everything that I need it to do as a daily driver.  Just make sure you pay attention to the installation process and uncheck the toolbar installation if you don't want it (might have to do a ""custom"" installation)."
"iWork is great for most things, and I find that it also carries Apple's rule of user-friendliness over function perfectly. However, with that rule comes the price you pay for not having the entire functionality that you might want. For instance, in neither Pages nor Numbers can you create a graph with a consistent X-axis. It only treats each data point as its own separate thing. In other words, if you input info for years 1956, 1987, and 1989, it will space them apart equally. So, I recommend this product for the average mac user, but not if you want to be using high-end software that can do anything and everything that you want it to."
"Is it photoshop? No.

But it's a lot cheaper.

It does everything that I need it to do, plus a bunch of other stuff I don't use.

It does process a little slow, but for the price, I have learned to be patient.

RAW processor is really good (I use it with Canon RAW files)

I use it mostly for black and white conversions.  The black and white film converter is awesome, allowing infinite color filters.

This will work for 99% of photographers."
"I've had Roxio several weeks now, & am still learning. ITunes is easy, also Alphabecally puts tunes in order.
The reason I wanted Roxio 10 for Apple Macs, was because people I know that have it, can copy cd's, and when they give them to people, the tune names & singer names are on the cd's, and goes into the computer that way.  ITunes is blank, like TRACK 1, TRACK 2, etc.
ITunes doesn't do this, except on originals.
[...]
The instruction Booklet doesn't give easy instructions.  At least not for me.
I may have to ask for help at my Mac club."

"I have used Norton for several years after contracting a virus while using a 'free' antivirus program. I have not had any problems, it's easy to install and use"
very good item in great condition.
"I purchased this download only to have it not download. I went through all the steps that I could to try to find and answer to the problem. I was finally at the end of my rope and started a chat session with Amazon. I was asked what sort of version of MAC OS  was using (I use one of the new versions) and a few of the questions that I had to answer when I was trouble shooting. I ended the chat session when I was told that they could not figure out the problem, I could not get a refund and my only option left was to try to contact Rosetta Stone and try to find an answer with them. I was not feeling good about this at all. I was not going to get a refund and I was being told to contact Rosetta Stone and spend possibly hours maybe days or weeks trying to get this program to download with no guarantee of success and no refund?!?!?!  I was not prepared to invest that sort of time and risk into this. I was going to contact some of my local Consumer Protection agencies to try to get a resolution. As I was leaving the sight I was asked to take a short survey. This was my worst Amazon experience and I wanted them to know. I felt like I got ripped off. After completing the survey a link appeared suggesting that I contact customer service to try to find a solution. I REALLY DID NOT WANT TO but I figured that I had nothing to loose so I did. We still could not get the download to work and it appears to be a known problem however, we (me and Amazon) were able to come to a workable resolution. This experience has soured me on Rosetta Stone online products and online down loads in general. Because Amazon was able to make things right I am still okay with them. I looking at the reviews and after experiencing first hand the short comings of this product I do not understand why Amazon continues to sell it."
"This PC virus protection costs much less than renewing McAfee virus protection directly from The McAfee website, and it covers 3 PCs! I had read that it was difficult to install, but I have Windows 8 on one PC and Windows 7 on another, and I had no problems uninstalling the old McAfee software and installing 2015 Total Protection on either machine. Great value."
"If you want to WASTE 3 hours and still not be able to download this program, go for it.  Me? I'm done with Norton."
"I foolishly upgraded my Amazon Cloud Player to this piece of garbage app assuming that it was an upgrade.  How wrong I was.  It has no Airplay.  This is like buying a car that turns out not to have a steering wheel.

"I spent a lot of time searching through reviews to make sure I wasn't going to end up with software that had problems.  Gee, have had this, and haven't been able to use it yet.  Tried to access the web site that the problem shooting gives...that didn't get me anywhere.  I finally had to contact my computer company to see if they knew what the problem was.  Sure, I have to go buy something new just to play this software.  I won't buy anything else online.  If I can't take it back to a store, I don't believe I want it.  First time to buy online, and my last!"
Microsoft ripping off students. Not cool.
"Purchased this at Costco only to discover later, as many others here have noted, that it no longer includes all the same functionality (in particular for my purposes, Schedule D) as in previous years.

Now, I have continued to use TurboTax for many years despite the fact that it is priced at a premium to other competitive products (including TaxAct and H&R Block's software). I'm not sure I had a very good reason for continuing to pay the premium -- mostly just familiarity, brand recognition, etc.

With this new change, however, to get all the functionality I need TurboTax will cost me $20 more than in previous years. Now I can no longer justify this product. Indeed, the cost just to upgrade from Deluxe to Premier costs more than TaxAct's product with all the functionality I need, let alone the base price I've already paid.

For a long time, TurboTax got away with charging me more than their competitors just because it was the familiar and they had all the flashy marketing. They've tried to push their luck too far now, I'm afraid. I'm returning the product to Costco and going with a competitor."
"I teach Linguistics in college. I bought this to get an overview of a general course in Linguistics, to see if I was missing something in my instruction, and to get new ideas and approaches. However, John McWhorter, the professor responsible to present the material, is extremely boring and dull. If the material is boring to me, who loves linguistics and majored in it, imagine how unbearable this must be for the general public. I have read other McWhorter texts (Babel, The Hoax) where he is finer (never exceptional, though), but here, I am sorry to say he misses an opportunity to engage the broader public into a passionate topic such as Linguistics."
Microsoft no longer offers the code that is required in addition to this DVD.  Your only option is a Windows 7 upgrade.
Could not figure out to use it.
This was a huge disappointment.  No fault to the seller but apparently the upgrade required a driver that I did not have.  Bad on Microsoft.

"I've used several VMs over the past decade. Some open source, some proprietary. Parallels is by far the best I've used in the Mac world, and probably equal to anything else on other platforms. If you are buying a Mac for the first time or still need another OS for whatever reason give Parallels a try because I think you'll love it too. Even if you are a VMware fan like I was when I first bought my Macbook Pro. I've been through several versions of Parallels, and v8 is definitely the best so far."
"I downloaded the trial version of this software from the Zonelabs website without any problems.  I have been using this program for approximately one month without any difficulties, glitches, irritations, or troubles.  I tried other major utilities such as Mcafee and Norton.  Both are pricey and worn-out.  Norton was drastically slowing down my computer.  I also experimented with Panda Security Suite and Pc-cillin.  I did not experience any major issues as some users suggest and report.  I decided to go with ZoneAlarm Security Suite due to good reviews and recommendations by various computer experts..."
The ease and versatility of this program is such a time saver. Completely satisfied with it as a Musical Play template.
"I have fought this and fought this and fought this...it kills me to have spent this money and not be able to use the product.
I think the anti-virus stuff works.
I think the firewall works.
The privacy service and spamkiller....oh my goodness. I have turned down the controls and turned down the controls to try and let me surf and get emails. I would put people on my ""Friends"" list and spamkiller would STILL block them. I would then go ""rescue message"" and it would delete the message altogether.
The privacy service...I still haven't figured that one out. I turned the controls down to where it was for all intents and purposes OFF. STILL could not look at my business webpage stats because it uses pop-ups. So I went to ""Log off Privacy Service"" - still could not get stats. I ended up having to go to the Windows Task Manager and kill the process guarddog.exe AND ONLY THEN would my webpages work right.

"I've been using this desktop navigation utility ever since it first appeared about 5 or 6 years ago, as a ten-buck shareware application, when the most up-to-date Mac OS was OS 7.6.

What is it? Action GoMac provides a Windows-like ""Start"" button, located precisely where you would expect a Start button to be if you were a Windows user. In this respect, GoMac is ""more than useful"" for Windows users acclimating themselves to the Mac OS for the first time. But it gets better.

GoMac is a Start button on steroids. Like the Windows version, it provides a Start Menu for navigation through folders and files, a QuickLaunch toolbar across the bottom of the screen where files and applications can be launched with single clicks and files can be ""dragged and dropped"" for opening, application buttons showing which applications are currently running, and, on the far right, a Clock Tray (including a pop-up calendar). The application buttons can be toggled either by mouse action or they can be tabbed through. A preference is provided for which only the active application (and its files) is open on the screen; alternately, all open applications and files can appear in separate windows if desired. An ""Auto Hide"" feature can be selected so that the GoMac bar disappears except when the cursor is over it. (Otherwise, one is left with the usual ""Windows clutter."")

The ""steroids"" enter the picture by way of the total flexibility with which the Start Menu and the QuickLaunch features can be programmed and arranged. Virtually anything - application, file, control panel, driver - can be placed in either location, providing unlimited flexibility and personalization. In most respects, the Start Menu is both more flexible and easier to customize than the Apple Menu. Even the appearance and size of the Start button itself can be personalized.

Here are a few good ideas that I've discovered, applying to my own method of operation and, possibly, to yours as well:

I put the TC/ICP control panel on the QuickLaunch toolbar. This way, I don't need to go searching for it in the control panels folder should I need to change my Internet connection (either because I'm travelling or because I've suddenly lost either my cable modem service or my phone service).

I put the ""Add Alias to Apple Menu"" AppleScript icon there as well, giving me ""drag and drop"" ability to quickly add to the Apple Menu. (Anything may be added to the Start menu by simply dropping it on the Start button.)

I put the Finder icon in the Clock Tray, freeing up space for other application buttons.

Now, in 2002, I'm running OS 9.2.2 on a Powerbook G4, which, with its huge 1152 x 768-pixel display, makes GoMac even more useful. Routinely, I'll have more than two dozen icons in the QuickLaunch toolbar and four or more applications open, with that many toggle buttons showing; the extra-large display certainly helps in this respect

Finally, despite the fact that GoMac has been - for about a year or so - a commercial application at a higher-than-shareware price, it is still a bargain, in terms of what it adds to any Mac running in ""Classic"" environment.

Users of Mac OS X have entirely different means for navigation, so my comments will not apply to them. But, if you're not on OS X, this utility is well worth your consideration.

Excellent.  Used for a class in Elements 4.0.  Easy to follow computer based training.
"This program does not follow the instruction manual. Many times I went,""by the book"" only to find out alot of dead ends. You have to spend hours to get even a simple website up. Forget trying to add music background. And tech support? Yeah right, they don't respond to your emails. You cant even call them collect! Would not buy again."
Been using TurboTax for as long as I can remember.  Goes great with Quicken.  I use the Home & Business version for myself and bought this one to help my 89-year-old aunt file.  She was amazed at how easily it worked.
I needed this for an assignment ASAP so I purchased it here (which saved me money) and I was able to download and use it within minutes.  It was great!
If you want an awesome piece of software to protect your home/small business against wireless intruders this would be it.  The software has this very easy to use interface that actually can interface with your wireless router.  I don't know how it does it but it is very cool.  I have a Dell router and installed the software and it knew I had a Dell router.  It prompted me for by admin account and password and presto I have easy security on my network.  It shows you in this easy to use inteface who is connnected and allows me to keep them or restrict them.  This is a must have security software!!!!
Great.
"Bought this for my fifteen year old son, who is a video enthusiast and he loves it.  Compared to some much more expensive programs it satisfies his needs and is easy to use."
"Abbyy's Home Edition follows the trend of software publishers to milk previous versions of their software, in this case, Abbyy's Finereader 5.0 (the current version for those with lots of money being 6). The OCR engine is solid, and the ""1-button"" interface is uncomplicated.
When it's time to move beyond the 1-button world, the product has a number of beyond-the-basic features, including the ability to manually identify regions of text, tables, and graphics. For much of today's complex and graphic-intensive layouts, you'll find yourself using this mode, if only to avoid annoying glitches such as parts of dense tables showing up as graphics
in the recognized file, or side-by-side columns becoming tables.
Home Edition handles both scanned files (...) and a wide range of graphic files that contain text. Fortunately, although the manual states that Home Edition recognizes only the first page of multi-page graphics files, that's not true -- all the pages of multi-page FAX TIFF files are recognized.
Recognition is good. For scans at normal resolution, 300 dpi, the total number of errors per page for a mix of type from 9 down to 7 points -- pretty small for OCR -- were the same as my old, 1999 Scansoft Textbridge Pro 8.0. However, the Home Edition errors were far easier to fix (""S"" for ""$"" on small, 7-point type for AHE, less annoying to me than the strange concatentions or ""wordifications"" for TP8 (such as ""Pap er"" or ""andPublish""). When the same material is scanned into Home Edition at 600 dpi (to add detail to the very small type), errors dropped to half that of Textbridge, which doesn't accept scans of this resolution.
A very difficult case, a second-generation FAX of a magazine article originally in tabloid and reduced to 8 1/2 x 11, was recognized surprisingly well with Home Edition, despite the fact that the type was fuzzy and 4-6 points in size -- and the bioprocessing subject matter had out-of-the-ordinary words. However, the 1-button process made tables of some of the columns, so manual marking of the original was needed.
I miss the ability to view the original scan during proof-reading in Textbrige (and the Abbyy higher-end products) -- as you move the cursor through the recognized document, these show you the same area of the scanned file. In Home Edition, you have to move between the scan and the recognized windows and find your own place. There's also no built-in spell-checker, an odd omission considering the low cost of licensing spellchecking code these days. Perhaps Abbyy is justifying the gap in pricing between Home Edition (less than[$$]) and the Professional line ([$$-$$] at the Abbyy site store). Versus the Pro Edition, Home Edition has 12 languages (121 for Pro); no pattern training for symbols; and no background or batch mode. There's apparently fewer options with HE's manual layout analysis than for the Pro Edition, but the HE options are just fine for most purposes.
Abbyy HE saves recognized text as ASCII TXT, Word, Excel, Word Pro and Word Perfect files, plus HTML and Adobe PDF. The good OCR engine, the ability to handle multiple types of graphics files, and to preserve graphics color, plus its straight-forward interface all make this a good product."

"This program does not allow me to fill out predesigned forms. No matter what, it is static, and for some forms this may be okay. What I primarily needed it for, this simply does not work. There was no way for me to discover this ahead of time, and now I cannot return this product. I am VERY frustrated. I now have to buy another program and have wasted my money and my time on something that will do me no good. I would be less annoyed if I could give the program back. I am incredibly disappointed, because this came highly recommended. I will not buy another ABBYY product."
"There are some problems with this program. Sometimes it works very well, but other times it will do something crazy like start typing will again and again for no apparent reason. They have improved as I've gotten more use to them, but there are not perfect."
"I don't know about the other review - I was expecting 42 hours of MP4 videos on how to learn Microsoft Office 2013, but what I got was some application that tried to mimic a video - that's fine, except that there were no controls to go forward, backward, play all, etc. Returned to Amazon for refund."
"I have been using Trend Micro PC-cillin since 2004 and I was quite happy with it until recently. I didn't like the 2006 version much either but it was still ok. When I saw the pop-up window for a free upgrade to 2007, I clicked on Yes immediately, since I had been paying for these annual upgrades before. Now I came to realize that I should have first read the reviews. Big mistake!

Not only it slows down my PC significantly, it starts using 100% of the CPU after 15-20 minutes and forces you to close it through ctrl+alt+del. After several weeks, I sent a message to Trend Micro customer service thru their website to ask about this problem. Never got an answer.

And the worst thing is, when I was using 2006, I made a mistake of recommending this product to my roommate and one of my co-workers and they both have 2007 now. And they both complain about the same issue. I feel sooo bad :(

Stay away from this product. I don't know what's good out there right now, though."
I like this software due to being very light on resources.
Great
I don't like.
This software is junk. I was looking for a software package I had back in the 90s called AdressBook Plus which was great and thought this might be it. Not so. Not even close. This is the usual melange of file driven nonsense so prevalent today. The old software was intuitive and friendly this is snarky and simple minded.
"Thanks, I like the program is easy to learn and dynamic, would recommend it to friends. Used very well on the iPhone and I can run or do other activity and learn"
great this was a restart old one expired
I know a more up to date one was released recently but this program is really really nice. Especially since its my second try at animating anything. I say give it a try.
Very handy for planning trips and has a tendancy to be more accurate for arrival time than Google maps.
"I bought this software to install on my new MacBook with OS 10.7 Lion. I had been using it on my old Powerbook running OS 10.3.9 and it worked very well for what I needed it for. I wanted this old version because Microsoft has taken the Page Break Preview feature out of the newer versions of Excel and I use that a lot and wanted to have it.

Found out the hard way though, that Office for Mac 2004 does NOT work for any Intel based computers, only the Mac Power PCs. Anyone who is trying to use this on a newer Mac will find that the programs are not able to run.

It's just fine on the Power PCs. A few minor bugs here and there, but then again, it is a Microsoft product...

**EDIT

I believe I was mistaken about this product not working on Intel machines. Apparently, this software will work on any Intel machine that is equipped with Rosetta Stone. This feature was discontinued on OS 10.7, which is why is wouldn't run on my new computer. Any Intel-Mac running an earlier version of OS X should be fine with Rosetta Stone."
Wonderfully designed and easy to follow.
It does not connect to all credit card and checking account providers. I receive more errors than anything else. biggest waste of my money and time. extremely disappointed.
"I was a loyal TurboTax customer for many years -- in fact my earliest versions of MacInTax are now legal drinking age. But when Intuit decided to change their pricing scheme and force me to upgrade from Basic to Home & Office to file some of the schedules I needed, I like thousands of others, decided to switch to H&R Block this year. H&R Block Deluxe worked fine -- it imported all my data from 2013 perfectly. H&R Block doesn't have as good of a user interface compared with TT, but it doesn't have those annoying ""upsale"" offers like TT either. Considering it was approx $70 less than the comparable product from Intuit, it was a no-brainer for me. I'm very happy with the product, my federal refund was safely deposited in my bank account several weeks ago and I plan to remain an H&R customer from this point forward ... or until they decide to make a bone-head marketing decision like Intuit."
"GIT really did a fine job with these comic collections. Too bad Marvel is now going totally online and won't let anyone have the actual comics in hand anymore. *sigh* Oh, well -- but if you can get it used (or from GIT), go for it. It's definitely worth the money!"
love it.
It changed the resolution on my PC and when I tried it on several different computers either doesn't work at all or crashes the machine when certain items are clicked.
"H&R Block has been advertising $9.99 state filing for some time now. So, it would make sense for someone like me who has a slightly more complicated than average tax return to purchase this software for $14.99, file my federal for free, then pay $9.99 to file my state taxes right? NOPE! ""Time to buy your state program for $39.99"" is the only prompt I get while using this software. You can do everything cheaper through their website so my consensus on this product... HOT GARBAGE."
"I was unsure about this program after I purchased and received it. But, it turns out to be pretty great! Only downside of it...the fact that it may say there are 17 ""Royalty-free"" tracks usable for any YouTube videos, that is not true. The song by Cadence Burns was flagged as ""copyright"" once I posted my video to YouTube. So, if you are doing any songs on there, make sure it's actually royalty-free."
waste of money no way to use it on any computer built after2008
It just works and is very fast. I'm using it on 5 computers.. The virus definitions are in the cloud. It's always updated. It's setup is simple.
"If I were just reviewing WinMe by itself, it would get about a 3 star rating, but since I have done a little research of what Windows XP is going to look like, I have to give it a 4, just so that people will but it instead of XP.  From what I've seen of XP, it deserves a -10 stars.
Sure, WinMe loads faster than previous versions, but that only means that the OS is loaded, it doesn't mean you can acctually use the computer.  Factor in the time it takes for Windows to run all those programs that DOS used to run, and you will notice it acctually takes LONGER before you can use the computer than Win98."
"I've used PhotoScore along with Sibelius for several years.  It performs better than these one-star reviews claim.  I use it to transpose sheet music and hymns, extract parts from scores and re-arrange choral music.

This is basically OCR software for music.  It needs to recognize and interpret staves, notes, symbols and lyrics.  The poorer the scan, the poorer the results:  GIGO.  It converts modern sheet music almost perfectly.  Older engraved sheets that are yellowed or are already second-generation printings will require some editing.  Smaller notation produces errors, especially in lyrics (think hymnals).  Directly converting PDFs has never worked well for me unless they are unusually high quality.

Converting hand written scores only works if you follow specific guidelines for writing the scores.  If the hand written scores have broken staves, stems or non-standard markings, you'll be out of  luck.

So why do I recommend the software?  Because if you take the time to learn the software and experiment with scanning, you WILL save a lot of time over hand copying or entering notes directly into Sibelius or Finale.

Here are some suggestions for successful conversions:

*Read the manual and understand how the settings affect the output.
*Use a good scanner.  I keep an old HP Scanjet 4470 on my desk for music scanning.  It will produce an actual (not interpolated) 600+ dpi image.
*Adjust the contrast and brightness settings much higher than normal to give a stark edge to the notation and staves.
*Go beyond the dpi settings suggested in the manual.  I've had success using up to 600 dpi resolution on small notation.  The files will be huge and processing will be slower, but accuracy will be improved. Beyond 600 dpi the files are so large that PhotoScore chokes.
*I have much better luck if I print PDF pages and use those copies to scan into PhotoScore.  (When I print the PDF pages, I increase contrast and brightness settings.)  This works particularly well with scores from IMSLP.org (PD website for classical music).
*Correct timing errors in PhotoScore before you send the music to Sibelius.  (The reason will become obvious once you've tried it both ways.)

The software works, but like any high level application you need to invest some time learning how to use it.  It's not ""plug and play"" by any means.

UPDATE:

Recently I needed to transpose a tune from a Broadway vocal/piano score.  The original's print quality wasn't great - stems and staff lines had some breaks.  I tried the usual tricks listed above but was still getting lots of mistakes in the conversion.  The technique that finally worked was this:  Using my laser printer, I copied pages with increased density and REDUCED the size of the pages by 15%.  When I scanned those copies into Photoscore the conversion was almost perfect.  Apparently the reduced size and density closed the gaps enough to trick Photoscore into seeing unbroken lines.  Even with time spent experimenting, it was still faster than transposing the ten page score by hand.

YET ANOTHER UPDATE:

I was transposing hymns again today and had to REDUCE brightness and increase contrast to get a good scan.  You can tell pretty quickly if the scan is going to work or not depending on whether PS recognizes the staff lines after you click ""read""."

THEN FINALLY JUST HUNG UP!  Now I get phone calls from Norton (no message) followed by emails saying they left me a message in voicemail.  NOT TRUE,... NO MESSAGE... Aaarrrggghhhhh!!!

"Safe Eyes was a fantastic program when I used it on my PC with Vista about 9 months ago.  We recently invested in a Macbook Pro and, after noticing that Safe Eyes was one of the highest rated Parental Control software of Mac, we decided that we would again use this this program.  Right off the bat I was impressed with the beautiful look of the new program and excited to use it.

There are several functional problems and let downs that seem too obvious to have been overlooked and I will try to outline everything I have noticed over the past few months with this program.  I will be exhaustive below but attempt to give a ""final conclusion"" summary at the end of this review.

(1) Usage time.  There is a feature that allows you to ""turn-off"" the internet on your computer at certain times during certain days (ex. you do not want internet access after Midnight).  (A) When using the internet around midnight, only about half of the time will Safe Eyes actually stop what you're doing to say that you're logged on after hours.  (B) If you close your computer before the cut off time, and open it after the cut-off time, you will (about half the time) have internet access for the rest of the night.  (C) Sometimes it will mistake midnight for random times during the day.  There have been many instances where I will be working and suddenly Safe-Eyes will pop up and say ""You have used your allotted time for the day"" only to turn off and turn back on.  Very annoying when uploading files, as you have to stop and restart the process.

(2) Usage reporting.  Safe Eyes allows you to send real-time reports to email or phone when somebody is trying to beat the system.  The reports are in blocks of 2, 5, and 10 blocked sites that the user tried to access in a particular amount of time.  (A) The reports are vague and unhelpful.  Only the base websites are reported and no reason is given for this.  For example, we would receive reports that say ""google . com, yahoo . com, aol . com.""  That is the extent of the information given.  It would have been nice if details like ""searched for term 'porn'"" or ""site includes word 'violence'"" were included, but no such details exist.  Because of this, it is easy for reports to be worthless (unless the website title is overly obvious).  (B) Another flaw is that after a site has been tripped, you will have ""free reign"" on that website without fear of a report being filed.  For example, someone decides to look for questionable content on youtube.  If they haven't been tripped on anything else, they can stay on youtube, tripping it hundreds of times, and no report will be sent (the usage reports only report each website once).  This leaves the possibility of testing the ropes of the software to find out what you can and cannot get away with.

(3) Random shut-downs. Safe Eyes has a feature where you can disable the program for a period of time, making the icon a grey check-box instead of a green check-box.  Every now and then (typically once or twice a week) the program will randomly disable itself, giving un-restricted access to anyone on the computer at this time.  I have noticed this primarily after it falsely attributes the current time for the disabled usage time or first thing in the morning.  This lasts anywhere from 5-30 minutes before the program will restart itself correctly, but any websites open once the program starts up will not trip the filter.  During this time, websites will not be blocked and reports will not be sent.

(4) Not able to customize word-search presets.  The most helpful part of Safe Eyes is the ability to type in words that you don't want yourself or others to be searching for on the internet, causing the filter to trip whenever that words is displayed in the URL line or page title.  You also have the option of clicking a pre-set that blocks all sexually suggestive words.  The problem, however, is that you are not given the opportunity to customize the pre-set words.  The pre-set will over-block to an almost unbearable amount.  Some websites that we can no longer access are Netflix, hotmail (about half the time), many google searches, and many others.  Any URL that uses a (seemingly) random assortment of letters and numbers is at the risk of being blocked (the letter ""X"" is a favorite).  The alternative is to customize your own list and put in as many inappropriate that you can think of without using the pre-set.  The problem with this is that there are always new ways to look for something and it will takes weeks (if not months) of trial and error before having a safe program for whomever is struggling.

(5) Over-block and under-block.  Typically over blocking is safer than under blocking. However, Safe Eyes will block many things it shouldn't and you will find yourself constantly receiving emails for the same sites (ad sites, search engines, etc).  On the flip side, it is incredibly easy to under-block unless you've put in every possible combination of words and letters.  For example, our computer is not able to access Netflix (due to the ""x"" in the word) or hotmail (half the time), but misspell an adult film star's name and you've got a full array of potential websites to visit.  Some may trip, others may not.

(6) Customer Service. Though they have always been nice and upfront with me, they are, for the most part, unhelpful.  For the above five issues, the solutions were:

1) Some sites automatically refresh the page (fox . com, for example) and will keep the Usage Time from kicking in.  Many online games will also have this same effect.
2) They do not support more detailed usage reports at this time
3) They had to install a script onto my Mac to disable the auto-shutdown that occurs when Safe-eyes does not detect a network for 5 minutes.
4) There is no support for this, you just have to use trial and error or say goodbye to some of your websites
5) See #4

Overview:  Overall, I had no complaints for Safe Eyes on Windows, but on Mac it is just too glitchy.  When you combine the errors in time for usage times, the generic and unhelpful reports, the random shut-downs, the inability to customize the presets, the tendency to over block innocent things while under blocking questionable content, and the lack of support from Customer Service, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this program to anybody.  Though it does restrict many things and has proven to be extremely helpful, it has taken about 4 months of trial and error to get to a place where one can safely surf the web.  Unfortunately, it's easy enough to get around still and may be out-of-date in another month or two.

UPDATE:  NetNanny is, so far, the best parental control software I have found on the Mac.  It is highly recommended."
"I normally try to avoid being rude, but this app is ridiculously useless. The only thing I liked is my book covers are bigger on my laptop than my Kindle 10.

It gives you the option to import collections, yet it won't allow you to import collections.  But, when you contact customer service for assistance, you are told that the option to import collections does not work in the app for the PC. When you ask why Amazon can't get the Kindle app for the PC to work with collections, but the Kindle app for my android has my collections and it syncs with my Fire 10, you get ""I will pass it along to our developers"".

I am not a developer. My question is, can the developers who work on the app for Android and iPhone, get together with the developers that work on the app for the PC for Windows 10, and figure out something?  Every time I upgrade my OS, I download the Kindle app, expecting it to be better and it never really gets better.  I don't understand why.  I guess I expected more from Amazon.  I don't HAVE to use this app.  The one on my phone works fine, and I have my Fire.  It is so disappointing that they can't do any better. Maybe others have more success than me with the Windows app for PC.

Actually, I also kind of miss the carousel  feature they had included with my Windows 8 laptop.  That proved to be a lifesaver for me.  I have a ton of books, and had to do a hard reset on my Fire once.  It wiped out everything I had set up. I was able to recreate my TBR list because of the carousel on my laptop.  Maybe one day I will get both the carousel, and my Collections will sync."
"After downloading this Antivirus, my system wents almost crashed position. Finally i called to Dell customercare and get the solution, it takes 4 hours work and unnecessary tension"
"When I first got it I ran a check on my new desktop and it found a lot of threats.  Since then I have had no other issues.  Wish I had gotten it before my laptop crashed, but at least i know any others I buy will be completely covered with ESET!"
Don't ever buy anything Norton. They are deceitful rip-offs...
"QUITE MISLEADING. Buyer, please BE AWARE! Amazon, please change your product info. It says ""Best Protection for 3 Straight Years."" I misunderstood this as the subscription as 3-years. It is ONLY 1 year. Not a good buy at all!"

"Having seen the many reviews that said this product would not load if you have Mac OS 10.9 (Mavericks), I went to the Norton web site and found two messages indicating that Norton Antivirus (NAV) 2012 was now compatible with 10.9. So I decided to purchase it. When offered the choice of buying a physical copy or a download, I opted for the download, thinking that Norton would have applied all the updates to the digital version. But, no doing ... when I tried to install the product, I was told that it was incompatible with my OS.

This made me mad, and I then spent two hours (!!) trying to call Norton and finally got help via a Norton live chat agent. Even when I let the remote tech take over my machine, it took him an hour to get the program working. The problem was that the failed install had to be removed, but to do that you had to have the remover program that has to be installed with the program (which, of course, hadn't installed). He then had to get a special removal program (only available to Norton techs) to deal with the failed install, and then get a new install program from Norton 360 Multi-Device 2014.

The bottom line--if you want to be able to use NAV on your OS 10.9 Mac, and don't want to endure hours of tech fiddling from Norton, you have to buy Norton 360 Multi-Device 2014, which costs a whopping $59.99.

My one-star rating is not for the program itself (which worked very well once I had it installed), but for Norton's inability to provide a 10.9-compatible program to anyone but previous users of NAV or those who can afford to buy Norton 360 or those who will spend three hours working with Norton's ""support"" techs."
I could not get it to work.
"Total waste of money and energy. Not easy to use, the video tutorials are useless, and there is absolutely no customer support. So basically, after you give them your money they don't want to hear from you again. There are much better software programs on the market. I would recommend you avoid this one at all costs."
"I have been using Norton before trying Trend Micro Internet Security for as long as I can remember, and I'm sorry to say that I think it's going to stay that way.  I don't hate this product at all and it does include many more things that Norton does not.  I just don't feel I need them and it really slows down my computer.  I would compare it to Norton 360. The Norton Live and the anti-virus protection is all I need. Someone who does a lot with finances may find this item well worth while.

There was a little problem for me with the install because it was a different product than the Norton 360.  It kept de-installing itself even when I de-insalled the Norton. I wasn't sure why because I was following the directions.  I chalked it up to not being extremely computer savvy.  But, I noticed that after Googling, I wasn't the only one with this problem. It would stop in the middle of loading and it would also shut down my computer. I've never had that problem with the other product, so I started getting a little nervous.  But, I was determined to get this to work. When I did, I wish I didn't.  It was S-L-O-W and really not acting like it always does.  In the end, I uninstalled it and bought another year of my ""usual"", which is fine with me. I love it for what I use my computer for.

If you need all of the ""extras"" that are included in this little box or if you do finances, then again, I'm sure you might want to give it a try. I on the other hand am going to pass and stick with what I'm used to.  Thank you Vine Program for giving me the opportunity and I will continue to bring you my honest opinion."
yes...most definitely met all my expectation and than some. Highly recommend.
"I was at first pretty pleased that there was no extra charge for filing my federal return electronically, and that the state return software is supplied free of charge. Then annoyed that it cost an extra $25 to file the state return electronically. Even though it's a ripoff, when you're that close to done, it's hard not to just say f*** it and go ahead and pay the $25.

One nice thing is that if you take your federal refund in the form of an amazon gift card, you get 10% extra - so a $1000 refund gets you an $1100 amazon gift card."
"There was something wrong with the site the application half downloaded then would repeatedly bring up error messages, when I tried to reinstall the app it said there was already another instance running on my computer. I called the support number they tried to tell me that it was my computer, I build computers and install operating systems and software  almost on a daily basis it was not my computer. avast tried to charge me 119 dollars to fix their mess I fixed it myself and I will never use another one of their products."
Great program! Easy to use.
"I had really high hopes for this.  I guess I still do, sort of.  But I've been working with it for nearly a month, and it's still very temperamental.  This was my first experience with Dragon software, so I have no prior experience with their products.

First,  I'm using it with a 2015 MacBook Air 13"", OS X Yosemite 10.10.5, using Pages (I don't use MS Word).  I've ""played"" with Apple's Dictation feature with decent results, but it's pretty basic.  I'm originally from the midwest, and I've lived on the West Coast for over 35 years, so my accent is fairly ""flat.""  Also, I'm using the Mac's built-in microphone -- no external ""higher quality"" mic for now, as I wanted to see how it would operate using standard equipment.

Installation went about as I expected (I worked in IT before I retired), so no major issues.  I worked through the tutorial, again with no major issues.  Dragon seemed to be able to understand what I was saying most of the time.  It's relatively fast, too -- but I do find I have to slow down my normal speech pattern in order for it to understand.  If I go slowly enough, I can get about 95% accuracy; if I speak ""normally,"" it drops to 80-85%.

I guess the biggest problem I'm having is its tendency to misinterpret words for commands, or not understand commands that it's supposed to be able to handle.  It works only sporadically -- even when I'm careful to enunciate clearly.  This is where I hope to see some improvement over time.  I may end up investing in a better microphone, too.

At this point, I'll keep using it for writing notes, reports, etc.  It does seem to work reasonably well for that.  But overall not enough to warrant more than 3 stars -- ""It's OK"" for now."
Pianohead has been a great addition to regular piano practice time. One student in the family has a strong ear for playing and she is having fun getting to know her notes and intervals better. Both students are encouraged by the knowledge gained through the game and the confidence earned. We strongly recommend it for others that are learning and playing the piano as it creates another dimension to learning that may not be achieved through just practicing on the keyboard.
"I have been frustrated by Davka's lack of accountability in the program's flaws. The Judaic texts found in the text library lack proof reading and have an astonishing number of errors in nikkud and spelling. When I inquired about the flaws they responded that the program is sold as-is and no refund or compensation would be granted. This is poor editing and shameful customer support.

If that wasn't enough, the program is counter-intuitive, especially for those of us who are used to creating documents in MS Word or any other word processing program. The help menu lacks content and is not user friendly.

This program has serious problems and a steep learning curve. Purchase at your own risk."
Out standing; A job well done. I was able to  download the product  with out any  snags or mishaps . Thank you  for providing a quality product at a great price.

"I am pleased with the way the software performed.

I do not like the reviews that require you to fill in more info."
Mine died after 15 months of very light use.  The only thing tech support told me to do was hold in the power button.  There are much better choices than a tomtom.
"I expected a difficult program, since it is labeled ""GMBH"" (made in Germany-Having lived there 18 years, I expected it to be difficult.  I was not disappointed.  In order to activate it, you must type 8 blocks of 8 letters and characters.  (8 X 8 =64!!!)!!!  This is more than awful, it is sublime!  I wanted to use the program, that's why I purchased it, not to take typing lessons!!  (I could have purchased a typing program for that..)  I had my HDD crash, and I  reformatted my drive and re-installed ll to have it crash again.  I then replaced the HDD and re-installed, but to have it crash  once again.  So I purchased a new Windows Install disc and wanted to re-install.  My license was used up.  I could not reinstall it.  So I attempted to send an e-mail to Acronis.  My God, it was even worse, they demanded the Country phone code, and practically my life history to send the stinking e-mail.  So I removed the program from my HDD and destroyed it.  I had enough problem getting everything else back on the system and working without having to go through all this.  It may be better than the older version (1 license) that I used 2 times.  But I recommend to anyone and all that if you want a truly frustrating program, purchase Acronis.  If you don't want all the trouble don't touch it with a 64 feet pole!"

"My first child liked it so much, I am repurchasing the series for my youngest. I bought the whole series (Toddler, Preschool and Kindegarden) for my first child some time ago. She spent hours playing the games and loved it. My youngest liked it to (Toddler & Preschool) but, unfortunately, scratched the CDs. He keeps asking for the Winnie the Pooh games so I am purchasing again Toddler & Preschool (fortunately, Kindergarden was spared!)"
I have no complaints about this newer version of office 2007 other than the fact that I have begun to hear rumbles of a 2010 version coming out next year and probably shouldn't have jumped the gun so quickly on 2007.
"Terrible product. When filling out EIN it defaults to a format of xx-xxxxxxx and will not allow for a standard EIN of xxxxxxxxxx. My refund is constantly rejected and I continuously am charged for a refiling fee. The only support that I received from customer service was that there is ""there is nothing we can do"". Furthermore they still have not offered a refund for their terrible product. I will never use this product again."
seems to be ok I have not had time to use it but my wife seems to like it not bad for the price.

"There are several window washing utilities that can be purchased on the web as well as utilities that are included in utility suites such as Norton Systemworks. This utility is by far the best of the bunch. Most of its competitors that can be downloaded are not as efficient and most of the utilities within suites do not work automatically, rather they must be given specific files to wash or wipe from the disk. Window Washer will automatically search for the default directories for your recycle bin, internet cache, cookies, and other temporary files that take up large amounts of disk space but are often not needed. It can then wash them automatically according to a schedule you set. For those who are security conscious or paranoid, numerous settings and histories can be washed such as the Document, Run, and Search histories found in the Windows Start Menu. Numerous ""tracks"" such as the listing of previously opened files in the File menu can also be washed. In addition to washing files and settings a user can have Window Washer bleach files by overwriting them a specified number of times with random data. There are literally hundreds of plug-ins that can be downloaded for free from the Webroot website to wash specific programs. If you are looking for a program to free up disk space or ensure privacy this the program for you."
Great product
"Works perfectly. Buy it here, and save approximately 50% off what the manufacturer wants to charge you. Make absolutely certain that when in ""My Orders"", to click ""Go to your Software Library. There, you will see your Winx DVD Ripper Platinum V7 download purchase, with the Activation Code in boldfaced type. Copy this, so you can paste later.

After downloading, when the WinX DVD Ripper Platinum V7 screen comes up, do NOT start the application. Rather, paste the Activation Code in the appropriate box.  After doing so, you will be given the opportunity to download (for free) the latest 'n' greatest version from the manufacturer. Do this. Then, you'll be all set to rock and roll, converting your DVDs to .mp4 files. Enjoy!"
Did not work return the product  to. Amazon. Have to probably get a new computer. we tried.
The description is misleading. I thought purchasing this would save me money compared with TurboTax online. But online filing state income tax costs an extra $20. That's sneaky!
Easy
Good
This is an ideal software for anyone who is interested in tracing their family's genealogy and keeping records along with photos of their loved ones.  Excellent hobby for anyone who enjoys working in research and discovering information regarding family members and ancestors.  Included is a year's worth of online research resources for your Family Tree Maker.
i own all the games and this is the best ever it was a little scary in some parts but very great buy it
Good product. I have bought sever of the graphics from this vendor. There are some duplications with other sets and some of the graphics have to be edited prior to cutting. Over all a decent product for the price.
nice
PC got to be so slow so 4 years ago installed PC Matic it put my PC back to full run speed again. There is 2 settings for the scan for your PC If you are on the computer a lot I would suggest setting it for FULL SCAN. I have mine set for full scan daily at 1:00 AM and have  had full speed last 4 years. I am very pleased
"This is a very useful mapping program. The software uses layers to draw on. There are tools to add streets to the existing template as well as colored lines . You can also create or use existing images to ""drop"" on the map and label these. I found the ""Print"" process is difficult to adjust to the size map you want.
The template for my area is outdated and when I checked with the company I was told that, ""because of the remote location"" (Hawaii) there were no plans to update.
Be prepared to spend some time discovering the features as the program is not very intuitive. The ""Help"" in the program is useful and you can print out the instructions.
All in all, I'm satisfied with my purchase and look forward to learning more of it's features.

Amazon was very efficient in filling my order and delivering this product. Well pleased!"
"I've been a quicken user for 13+ years and have been completely satisfied.  I recently purchased both Quicken deluxe 2009 and turbotax deluxe 2008 for $54.98 no tax and no shipping.  You can get that price usually once a year.  Basically, I buy turbotax at the current price and always get Quicken deluxe for ""free.""

I did have issues upgrading from Quicken 2008 to Quicken 2009, but given my current long term experience with Quicken, I always back up my data on a different drive each time I download data.  My Quicken file is now up to 22+ megs.  During my last upgrade, some of my data had not been transferred and who knows why.  This was frustrating and scary, but it has happened before.  I'm running Vista and I ended up totally removing Quicken 2009 and reinstalling Quicken 2008.  I then loaded my latest 2008 backup version and did a validation and super validation to ensure that the data file was not corrupted or had cross-links etc.  The file did not have any issues after I did both validations.  I think I performed a file copy as well, since that has an impact on the data file.  I then reinstalled Quicken 2009 and then quicken ""successfully"" converted my 2008 data file to the 2009 file.  However and for some reason, I had to run Quicken in administrative mode to successfully open my new 2009 data file.

Was it frustrating?  Yes, of course but I still think that Quicken is an outstanding program to integrate all your financial data.  The program has totally automated my financial holdings.  I still will give Quicken 2009 5 stars.  However, I do agree with some of the reviews on the stability and buggyness of the software.

Enjoy and you can get it for ""free"" every year and that's not such a bad investment.  Hopefully, Intuit will take some of the comments regarding the stability of the software to heart and produce better versions in the future.  I'm not giving up on them yet."
"This works in keeping anti virus out of my computer, it just takes up a little space"
"I spent two hours today in a chat with two HR Block Customer Service Reps.  The issue?  After entering NYS tax info, I noticed that the refund amount was low.  That made my Spidey senses tingle.  My husband works in NYC and therefore pays NYS and NYC taxes.  HR Block didn't ask about the NYC taxes and it didn't transfer the NYC tax amount that was entered in the W-2 section of the Federal return.  I figured that I had made a mistake and went through the NY section several times with no luck.  Then I pulled up the NY form and found the NYC tax box and tried to enter the amount manually.  The program wouldn't let me.  After many tries, I decided to contact customer service.
This is what happened...
Rep 1 told me to restart my computer because that would allow the program to ""kick-in"".  I asked her why the software didn't prompt users to do this if ""kicking-in"" on installation was a problem.  She had no answer and I gave in and restarted the computer.  This, of course, disconnected me from Rep 1 who probably told me to restart to be rid of me.  After restart, the issue wasn't solved so I got back into the Customer Service queue.
Rep 2 told me that there is no separate interview for NYC.  She added that this is because NYC was a city and not a state.  I repeat, she said that NYC didn't have an interview on the NYS return because it was a city and not a state.  After doing a facepalm, I explained to her that some cities collect their own taxes.  As such, since NYC (and Yonkers) are part of NYS, there should be an interview for both NYC and Yonkers on the NY software.  She had me pull up the form page and right click on some boxes which took me to other boxes that had nothing to do with our situation.  While she was searching for a way out, I discovered that I could override the blank in the NYC box.  This caused a warning message to appear that said that an override would not allow for efiling.  Additionally, the software did not recognize this override and although the refund on the form changed, the interview screen amount didn't change.  After a lot of failure, I asked for a refund of the state (I had NY free & NJ paid) and she refunded my money.  Amazon was also nice enough to give me a full refund of the software even though I bought it over a month ago.

I do not understand how HR Block missed NYC and Yonkers.  This could affect millions if they don't realize that money they paid to those cities wasn't recorded.  I've used Turbo Tax for years and only decided to switch to HR because of the stunt Turbo Tax pulled this year.  Our state refund was thousands more last year and there were no issues with NYC on Turbo Tax.  How HR Block could gloss over these two cities is mind boggling.  Oh yeah, it's because these are cities and NY is a state.  Buyer beware...You may save a few bucks with this software but you could be out thousands in unclaimed taxes.  You've been warned.  This is a lawsuit waiting to happen...

Grudgingly going back to Turbo Tax."
Upgrade from PSE 9. I like it.
"It is like a story read on the computer. And there are also some facts of bats to, that my girl that are 5 love, even my 2 year old girl loves to hear the story, and at the same time see the pictures. A greate game, and educational too.

Sorry for my english, working on that..."
"I wanted to share how much our family is enjoying ItzaBitza - It's perfect for us! I have two children - a 5 year old daughter who is in Kindergarten and a 3  year old son. My 3  year old has autism and this game is fantastic for him - it really brings out the imaginative play for him as well as direction following - both are key development areas for autistic children - I've recommended it to his ABA therapist who loves it! My daughter is also learning to read and it has been really great to watch her progress - to ""play"" and learn at the same time! It's not uncommon to hear fantastic hearty laughter coming out of the computer room!

Thanks for this innovative and great new tool to connect with and enable both of our children!

"It's made by Microsoft.  Improved from the previous year's product - Office 2013.

It installs in only a few minutes and is super low maintenance when installed/configured properly.

What's not to like here?  Times are changing so stay on top of these changes and keep relevant.

Our only concern is how this is tied to an online account for re-use/recovery of your license details -- shame on you Microsoft."

Great software.  Switched from TurboTax Deluxe.  All of the forms are there.  This application is just as intuitive and easy to use to file your returns.  There isn't a need to use TurboTax any more since the greed of the CEO has rendered it almost useless.  Give this a try.  I think anyone coming from TurboTax will not skip a beat and it costs much less also which is a plus.
fastest installation I ever did on windows. Its sooo fast and I didn't even need to use any disk drivers for a fresh install.
Great product.
"I've have used Sendphotos (including previous versions) for what must be two or three years now. I've also tried other similar products. Sendphotos Gold is far and away the best of breed. The results are good-looking emails, automatically resized pics, in a variety of layouts and ""frames."" The product is simple to use, reliable, well-designed.

To use, you select the pictures you want and optionally the layout you prefer, the background, the size of the pics, framing, captions, and main email message. Every change you make is previewed immediately and quickly. When you are ready to send, Sendphotos contructs an email message in your favorite email program. At that point, you can if you wish make other edits to the text (or don't have to), and send it off. The resolution of the email images is automatically adjusted for email purposes, making the email small enough. The results are very attractive, and the process is speedy.

Highly recommend this application, one of my favorites. Even if you use another photo organizer (as I and many others do), use Sendphotos to create the emails."
Arrived as described.  I was pleased with purchase
ok
My main problem is that I can't use it ... why?  Because amazon updated this program and kindle to the point that my aged but valient macmini can no longer download music or kindle.  I keep getting a message to upgrade both kindle and amazon music which I can't do because my macmini OX won't allow these upgrades ... thanks amazon.  Just Brilliant (sarcasm factor).  This also makes Prime useless because two of its features I also can't use.
"When purchasing the title states this is the newest 2018 version, but once purchased you receive the outdated 2016 version."
"I have installed all popular AntiVirus programs on various machines and all have their weaknesses.  I got fed up with Norton when multiple problems led to ""uninstall and reinstall"" which still didn't solve problems.

ezAntivirus works fine and the subscriptionss are the most reasonable around. It updates incredibly fast; others don't.  CA even allows subscription transfer to another machine!

Reviewers with lockup problems (BSODs) with 2000/XP should update their Nero InCD program; this is a known bug."
Price was very reasonable
Really like this program.
Performed poorly.
Thanks...as advertised
It walks you through step by step.  Its simple to use and checks your entry for potential errors.  As a professional in the tax field I recommend this product to people looking for a tax professional who I believe have returns simple enough to do on their own.
Keeps my computers running smoothly and safe from cyber attacks.  Reports let you know the various issues that were resolved automatically.  Great tech support if needed.
I've been using System Mechanic for quite some time now. I have to give it credit for keeping my 10 year old Dell desktop in tip-top shape. In computer terms this thing is a dinosaur but it still does everything I want it to do. System mechanic has help delay to the necessity to purchase a new desktop. I have an brand new hotrod laptop. Since I have the 3 computer license I installed SM on it also. I have no doubt it will keep it running and tuned up for years to come. I highly recommend this software to anyone. It's does exactly what IOLO says it will do.
"I am a retired electrical engineer.  I had a lot of CAD experience at work, but most of that was laying out circuit boards with programs specific for that task.  My primary use for Turbo Cad is designing model airplanes in 2D.  I've been using it for about 6 weeks now.

Pros:
1)  Powerful for the price.  I bought V16 Deluxe for $30 when version 17 was the latest and greatest.  This is orders of magnitude better than anything from Autodesk.

Cons:
1)  Not intuitive.  I'm OK with having to learn how a specific function works, but it is frustrating to completely lose a function you have already learned.  For example, is the Mirror button in the Edit menu, or was it in Modify, or maybe Format?  No, it's in the Copy Entities submenu of the Edit menu!
2)  Toolbars are confusing.  For example, the Draw Line button is usually on the toolbar, but if you have recently drawn a rectangle, the Draw Rectangle button will replace the Draw Line button on the toolbar, and you have to go back to the menu to get the Draw Line button.
3)  Help is terrible.  Help for any topic calls up the same 702 page help screen (the PDF manual), and only rarely takes you to the correct topic.  To add insult to injury, the PDF manual covers all versions of Turbo Cad, so half the manual doesn't apply to Deluxe.
4)  It crashes frequently on my computer (a 2 year old Dell laptop running XP).
5)  Snap to grid (a feature I use a lot) is so awkward it is almost useless.  Example one:  When you move an object, the move handle is not automatically on grid.  You can put it on grid manually, but this is an extra step, and if you forget your grid placement is screwed.  Example two:  The snap capture range changes dynamically depending on the current zoom size.  So if you are zoomed in too far, it won't always snap to grid, and your grid placement is screwed again.
6)  No support for custom paper sizes, and there are no page sizes larger than 36"" x 48"".  So using a big plotter which cuts its own sheets from roll paper is not as useful as it could be.  This is a serious limitation for building model airplanes."
"A better work screen then previous versions..At least It got away from looking like kid stuff.
The use of layers is what I do like."
"This product is wonderful I teach adults with learning disabilities and it has turned out to be great teaching tool for them, they can go at their own pace, see their scores in front of them, and be able to see how far they have progressed."
Did an upgrade form 2007. Software is as always a great product this version is just right for home office use. Prefer this over the licensed version.  Is superior to version 2007.
I usually require several different forms for my tax return and TurboTax has them ALL (even some I didn't think to use). A must buy unless you have a simple 1040-A.
"Caveat Emptor, as usual for these types of products. Learning a foreign language well is a major undertaking that takes a lot of work and time. This product claims to allow you to explode through the language barrier for any of these languages. I never believed the hype (I hope no one does!), but I did want to be able to hear some Bemba language and get a few words of bemba vocabulary - too bad for me, AFTER opening the package you find out that 76 languages are included in their interface with audio and phrases, 25 languages only have vocabulary flash cards (""vocabulary of the world"") and no audio! Bemba, that I couldn't find in other language learning aids, was, unfortunately for me, one of the unspoken languages. If you are interested in learning a major language, such as Spanish or Thai, there are better products. If you are considering getting this product because you are interested in getting some exposure to an obscure language like Bemba, Maori, Samoan, make sure it is one of the ""Languages of the world"" and not one of the ""vocabulary of the world"" langauges, because these scammers make it so can not tell until you open the package."
"Frustrating.  The online portion did not work. I spent an hour with intuit trying to get this to work. They said (and I frankly agree) that it doesnt make sense to bundle online with a desktop version, because you use one or the other, and not both. THey said it was up to Amazon to provide a different online code, which I don't have.  Regardless, it was the online part that I was looking for.  When I enter the product information it says that it is not a valid code for the US.  This was through amazon.com..... about 100 yards from where I sit right now - in the US.  If I could just get the code for online use I would try it and perhaps this would improve my opinion - but so far a 1/5."
"It really simplifies my electronic life.  I even integrated it with dropbox and now I have access to all of my documents everywhere.  This product made me scan and organize my entire paper life.  I am practically paperless with my personal documents.

I set up my scanner to scan things right to the Inbox.  Then when I have a few minutes I sort everything out to the ""cabinets"" and ""drawers"".  My husband liked it to so we ended getting one for his business laptop also.

It is expensive software, however it is quality. You get what you pay for."
Before Corel purchase PaintShop Pro I loved it and used it all the time.  Now it's completely unusable for me.  I'll never purchase another Corel product.  It's such a shame that they ruined a great user friendly product.
I have been very happy with my copy of the Movavi screen capture software. It does exactly what I want and more.

"Use it if you don't have time to go to all different sites to download all new forms for the new HiPAA regulations, and you even don't need new binder for all new policies, you can use the binder in which it comes, in the end it's even have dividers by year. It took me several hours to update my policies, no need to invite lawyer and pay triple. You actually can download a lot of things on AMA site, but not everything included in this binder ."
"I am a first-time user and purchased #8.  I found it to be easy to use and understand, and the ability to print out nice looking family trees is great.  However of the 35 CDs that came with the #8 Deluxe package, I found one useful and the others excess baggage.  If you get the cheapest version of FTM, you'll get your money's worth.  Any more and you'll have a lot of spare CDs to use as drink coasters for your hot chocolate.  The strengths of the program are it's ease of use, the ability to include photos and ""scrapbook"" info, and to print attractive trees.  The weaknesses of the program are the misleading advertising that makes you think you can use it for researching and the frustrating ""buy, buy, buy"" pitch at every turn. I would recommend FTM, but mainly as a good basic database."
"Took kit to repair shop but was unable to use because the CD's had on them ""NOT FOR SALE"" so I could not use them."
"Windows XP (both Home and Professional editions) are absolutely horrific. I say this especially with the introduction of Service Pack 2, which makes the software even worse. First and foremost, Windows XP requires that you have a lot of RAM and video memory, simply to display its overly-graphical interface. This shouldn't be a very big deal, considering that most modern computers are equipped with requirements necessary to run it. However, Windows XP is not suitable for older computers, or computers with any less than 256 MB of RAM, and low video memory. (Though it will technically run, it will be very laggy.)

The software, which is full of security holes and risks, will likely require you to reformat every 30 or so days. (Assuming that you do not have the sufficient virus protection available to block the many viruses developed purely to abuse the security holes found exclusively in Windows XP.) However, to counter this, Microsoft has developed Service Pack 2, which is an utter nightmare. Service Pack 2 adds a built-in firewall (improvement) and virus-blocking feature, which runs in the background at all times. Whenever you attempt to download something, or execute certain files, you will always be faced with the firewall asking for confirmation. This can become rather annoying. The worst part about the service pack is that it attempts to prevent piracy by not allowing you to install certain software. i.e., you will not be allowed to install, or run, Alcohol 120%. (Or other versions.) Any attempt to do so will cause your system to crash, leading you to the 'blue screen of death.' (Something that has no business appearing in Windows XP.)

The detault software settings have the Windows Messenger utility enabled, which means that advertisers will constantly spam you with pop-ups which cannot be blocked. (Unless you know how to turn the feature off, or unless you specify for you firewall to block it from being contacted.) Many people have taken advantage of this by developing patches which turn the feature off, but they charge you to use it. In actuality, anybody can turn it off. It's a simple matter of going through your control panel, into your administrative tools, and disabling the feature there. However, nobody is expected to be computer literate enough to do so.

This time around, Microsoft has decided to bundle spyware with Windows. Though you can remove it with any standard spyware scanner, it is still an annoyance.

Microsoft has also decided to add a 'Product Activation' tool, which forces you to go online and validate your product key with Microsoft. There are a limited number of times in which you may do this, meaning that you can only reformat your computer so many times before your key expires. At this time, you have to pay Microsoft $10 for a new product key.

Lastly, Microsoft has done nothing to improve Internet Explorer, or any of its other built-in software. You are stuck with the same, tabless version of IE, which still has all the same security flaws as before -- if not more.

I would much rather stick with Windows 2000, or Windows NT Workstation 4.0, than Windows XP."

It was a difficult choice between Realflight and the Phoenix Simulators. I chose the Phoenix because you do not need to purchase add on hanger packs to expand your variety of aircraft. I fly fixed wing airplanes and use a futuba 6xa radio with a round trainer plug. I need to purchase an adaptor to hook up the simulator to my radio. They vary in price for different radios. You do have the option of purchasing a radio with the simulator but I wanted to use the radio I would use in the field. Everything pluged up fine and easy. The program install flawlessly and after a simple calibration of my radio to the program I was ready to go. One feature I really like is everytime I open the program it goes online to check for new free download aircraft which you then have the choice of adding to the program or not. The simulation seems very realistic. All the aircraft have different flight characteristics so they handle differently. With the exception of having to add the adaptor cord this is perfect for my use. Highly Recomended
"Have you ever seen a US Cellular commercial? If not, you're lucky because you're missing a stomach turning spectacle. The ads are engineered to pluck your heartstrings with some totally corny and improbable emotional story. After wiping away your tears at the heartrending scenario, you realize that they were just trying to sell you a lousy cell phone. They used a touching story about helping grampa find meaning in his life to pitch me a cell phone plan? I want my emotion back! What a rip off! I don't appreciate being tricked into caring about some dumb product.
""World of Goo"" will not do that to you.  There's just nothing fake about it to leave you feeling disappointed or underwhelmed. It is authentically beautiful in every way. The gameplay is utterly unique. The story is silly and fun and well written and creative. The graphics are expressive, colorful, and buttery smooth on my average computer. The music is hauntingly catchy. The sound effects are perfect. The two independent guys who released this game (their first, according to the press) are far cooler than the conglomerates that just churn out sequel after sequel after sequel these days, changing nothing but the graphics of their tried and true formulas. We need another run-and-shoot game like we need another smallpox epidemic.
""World of Goo"" is just FUN. I stopped playing and now I'm overtired because it's three AM and it's past my bedtime but I couldn't bring myself to turn it off until now. I guess I can't really imagine how the game can go on for weeks like some of the other titles you can buy, but World of Goo is only $20 - that's less than half what most video games cost. If it's not the hugest imaginary world ever, that's not a big deal.
Bottom line, if you can operate a mouse, I promise that you will get $20 worth of fun out of this game."
"Caveat:  I am comparing this to systemworks standard, 2005.

Although I've been a user of symantec/norton products for about 10 years now, there has always been some bugginess about them.  This is the smoothest release I've ever seen.  This is also based on a 3 day review, so it's not really thorough.  This also refers to the download version, which is a bit more difficult because I had to burn my own ISO boot/backup/restore disk.

That aside, the reason for the 4 stars is the redundancy in ways to do the same (or very similar) thing twice, and for the minimal (if any) changes to Norton Utilities.  Norton Ghost 10, for example, does automatic and manual restore checkpoints on backups.  GoBack does the same thing, but it's not meant for ISO, obviously. GoBack hasn't changed much, if at all, since 2005.  However, the two togther are somewhat redundant, and could be possibly merged.  Safe install in Goback is now automatic, tho (i.e., ""it appears you are installing a new program, you'll have the option to restore to pre-install conditions"" or some such verbage).

Norton Utilities is about the same, straight up.  Wipe slack space, for example, is still a drop down selection, rather than a button option.  In fact, everything in Norton Utilities seems the same in the control panel from 2005.  No memory defrag. No internet tweaking tools.  Just as an idea, symantec, if you're listening, and have no plans to improve Norton Utilities, you could set up a way to allow plug ins like Nvidias N-Tune app...

What's new to me (and possibly other upgraders) is Checkit, which has been updated (but still covers mostly the same content), and Benchmark test, which compares my system against others, and itself, during tweaking, overclocking, or upgrades.  However, the list of comparable systems is painfully short.  I lucked up and had the exact same setup as one indicated, except for the drives. Process viewer, which is new, gives a greater deal of control and understanding to operating processes (same as the Windows process viewer, just with more options, such as Google this - useful for ID'ing what's running).

Ghost has some redundancy in view progress and performance. Progress is shown during backups anyhow, performance is a useful tool though, to give a sliding scale priority to backups while using other programs, from low (very slow backup) to high (in-use desktop programs take forever, but ghost flies).  My 15 gig test setup compressed to 3 gigs on my backup drive, and the incrementals have been reliably popping up to say they're doing so.

What's different?  System Optimizer includes user level controls (meaning you can, for example, restrict individual accounts or tweak individual accounts - there are also many more options in there now for tweaking and information.  The downside is that settings are still locked to admin level accounts, except for basic things like virus scan.

The main proggy startup has a changed ""Norton Status Screen"" which has been basically rearranged, but offers more immediate acccess to tools freqently used, rather than clicking ""change settings"" or ""more info"".  Some have been renamed/regrouped, such as ""Performance"", which covers auto-protect, spyware, Improve Performance (accesses defrag), clean clutter, fix windows problems (windoctor).  Also new is a Norton Status bar that attaches to the lower right taskbar (the regular task icons still install).  But the Norton Status bar will pop up on startup giving a snapshot of system health, it seems to me a shortcut to the entire program, should things go wrong anywhere. The status bar is NOT system doctor, which is still available via Utilities.

Everything boots smoother and faster, much faster.  Of course, I haven't loaded the system down.  I had tried Iolo's v6, and while I liked it's myriad of utilities (memory defrag and recover, for example, and a slew of others that Norton lacks) it was buggy beyond belief on almost everything else). I suppose, in all fairness, I should have tried a clean boot install of Iolo v6, but even so, its lack of information (just stuff like ""3 spyware programs detected"" without giving info was useless).

Norton's antivirus scans are faster, and sport a new interface.  Registry optimizer is about the same as before, and one button checkup hasn't changed.

With the exception of Norton Ghost (which I love), I would have been disappointed in the upgrade had I purchased regular systemworks... the changes are incremental, rather than monumental. However, they make sense and improve the program, well, incrementally.

One thing I still haven't isolated is use with Windows firewall... I was able to use Norton's worm detection and Windows firewall simultaneously without flaw in Systemworks 2005.  Now when I try to do the same, downloads slow, then stop completely.  It's one or the other, it seems (or install Norton Firewall, which the protection center will suggest (albeit unobtrusively, thank God.

The whole core Norton system, including goback and all is now a 1 button install. Performance test is separate, and strikingly similar to checkit.  There is also a new registration/validation procedure which claims to be designed to resolve the repeat installation errors that plagued 2005 (regular systemworks, anyhow).

Also, during online purchase, I tried to delete the extended backup service, but it would delete the whole order.  This only happened with Premiere, I tried it with other products, and it would not occur.  CD Buyers will not have this issue, of course.

Overall, I am happy with the purchase.  Overclockers beware that a cmos reset, and even some overclockings, will screw the pooch on Systemworks, and require going thru all reinitilizations again (goback, full virus scan, etc.) - At least on my system.  Your mileage may vary.  I've probably missed a few dozen improvements which the Norton folks will protest, and the Iolo folks, well, they will learn from their customers .. but this is where things stand now.

Norton is the 800 lb gorilla because it is the best, in my opinion, even with a few bugs, lack of Norton Utilities update, and some redundancy in functionality. If I had to summarize it another way, it is the best antivirus application around, period, with the best of the available utilities, even if they are significantly limited compared to other upstarts."

"This decision is mind numbing and incomprehensible.  Yes I read the part about calling the service team for existing customers but why should I?  It's almost as if Intuit is being run for the benefit of an academic experiment on how annoying they can be to their customers and still retain them.  I don't believe other products out there are superior but at this point I really can't digest any explanation on why I would continue to use a product whose developer has made such a customer unfriendly and ill-conceived decision.  Here's the real rub for Intuit.  Many of us, myself included, are habit based.  If we move to another product this year, even if Intuit ""corrects"" this decision we'll stay with the new product we chose, just because it became the new familiar."

"For many of my clients Quickbooks is a great, powerful program.  Most of my clients don't need the Premier edition, and Quickbooks Pro is more than sufficient.

I don't have anything to add to the conversation about Quickbooks Premier 2014, except when you have greater needs, or say up to a ""zillion"" transactions you have to buy a ""larger"" version of Quickbooks, i.e. up to ""Enterprise"".

Quickbooks in general is the default program with no real alternatives nor competition of which I am aware.  I couldn't tell you another program in the category.  Some folks may still use Peachtree, and Microsoft Money may not exist anymore.  Thanks for not making it any more expensive.

Unless you're just using a spreadsheet (again, not many choices) and want an accounting program QB is pretty much it.

A fine program, despite some of its insidious portions typical of this program and others in the world of software.  I have no idea of its new and improved features.  Perhaps they are also mostly useless bells and whistles as are other updates to other software and hardware updates.

Perhaps I am just a user who doesn't take advantage of many features some of which may actually be helpful, so it may be unfair of me to comment, though I may also be a typical user.  I use a different program for my own accounting, but use this program for some clients' accounting, and use Quickbooks Accountant's version for the most part for clients who use Quickbooks.

I have to buy new programs each year as my clients wind up buying accounting software and buy the latest versions of Quickbooks.  I don't know that they use more than the basic accounting functions of cash receipts, cash disbursements, billing, accounts receivable, and maybe downloading information from his and her bank accounts into the program after using online banking at most.  Quickbooks does make my work easier for delving into client transactions and being able to answer many of my questions and narrowing down the questions that I need to ask clients.

Unless you're ready to pay for annual updates, you may not want to use the payroll part of the program and may want to use a work-around.

So, although there are virtually no other accounting program choices, it is a powerful, great program at a reasonable price."
"I have switched from a PC to a MAC, and have also gone back to school to get a certification in SPED. I can hardly say how valuable this software has proven.

crack NBDE  is one of the best app available to ace in NBDE test. It prepares you with the right kind of questions while preparing you with simulated tests and makes you accustomed with the scoring pattern. I feel lucky to purchase crackthe nbde  and strongly recommend this to all NBDE aspirants.

The best quality is that for the most part you aren't even aware that it's running.

Highly recommended!"
"Right now it is not downloading.  Disappointing. :-(
It just say it has a problem downloading then you are only able to press the X which shuts it down.  Tried it 12 times.  At first it did nothing before it made me shut it down.  Now it starts downloading then runs down to 0.00mbs.
Maybe their servers are down?  I will try a couple more times tonight and if no luck, then, tomorrow and update this review.  So far I have to give it one star because it refuses to download."
I would highly recommend all business owners to purchase QuickBooks Pro. It is always up to date on all state employer taxes and simplifies the payroll process leaving the owner able to focus on their business.
"I use to be a Norton user but then my husband, and others, recommended Trend as it doesn't interfere with your other programs as much.

It made it easier to communicate with others.  Works very well!
I recently purchased this program with some limited expectations based on the price. I was mistaken!  This is an exceptional program and would be a bargain at twice the price. I am particularly enjoying the flexibility offered in structuring the lessons.  It is a total learning package with all the features I believe I will need to learn to speak Spanish fluently.
"I wish they would stop messing with the software.  The change in entering information is confusing and tedious to use.
I use it because I have used it for years but am thinking that it may be a time for a change.  I do not use it for tax preparation, but for keeping track of my expenditures.  The program is not as good as the previous version.  There is no way to reformat the way the registers are listed on a side panel.  You can't change the font or color of the entries in a register.  If there is a way, I wish I knew.  Also the colors are disconcerting on the registers.
I found the change in reconciling my accounts to be a problem.  There are some of the categories that are a pain to enter or making the category stay as you want it to.  Also, the program will sometimes redefine your category entry if you need to enter a different category for the same payee.
 Reconciling is not as good even though is looks better.  I do not like the register but it is simpler in some ways than past editions.  It just seems cumbersome if a program can be cumbersome..
I had to buy the new software update when I encountered difficulties .
The support staff was good and very patient which eliminated my frustration before buying the update.
While I am not happy with all of the aspects found in the software, I do use it.
It does what I want it to and solving the software problems will be ongoing but the support staff is helpful."

"Let me begin by saying that I've only been using Photo Deluxe for a couple weeks, but I'm probably being generous with the 4-star rating.  The fourth star was mainly for the free web-posting capability and Adobe's reputation.  As general use goes, I guess I'd have to give it a three.  First off, as  with prior versions, the step-by-step progression through everything makes  me crazy!  I had hoped that Adobe would have abandoned this for the new  version.  I'm not wild about having to go through all the proceeding steps  to get to the one I want.  Also, I don't care for the way this program sets  up printing, and don't make more than one mistake without saving because  there's only one level of undo, so if you really screw up, you have to  start over from the beginning or your last save point.  And then when you  want to ""save as"" you get to choose the Adobe PDD  format...period, unless you save for e-mail or the web then you get to  choose JPEG and a couple others.  But try to open an Adobe PDD format in  another editing program and you'll more than likely find that you can't do  it.  In it's favor, there's a lot of neat tools here and it's fairly easy  to use.  There's lots of ""cute"" stuff like the clip art and the  seasonal add-ons that the program automatically notifies you of so you can  put the CD in and load it if you're into that sort of stuff. I've spent an  enormous amount of time experimenting with different editing programs over  the last few months looking for a decent one under $100 just for general  purpose use.  I do photography professionally and I use Photoshop 5.5, but  that's another league.  This is all opinion, but for ease of use, Microsoft  Picture It gets my vote especially when it's used along with Microsoft Home  Publisher 2000.  But for about twenty bucks more than Photo Deluxe 4.0  there's Ulead Photo Impact 5.0.  This is a great program!  There's up to 99  levels of undo and great tools and palletts.  I use this one extensively.  And the really good web tools are on Photo Suite III.  As for Photo Deluxe  4.0, it's an ok program, but if you're just beginning to get into digital  imaging, I believe Picture It is the better bet, and if you want more for  not much more, go with Photo Impact 5.0.  All in all, I'm really  dissappointed in Photo Deluxe 4.0."
Great product upon cursory examination.  I hope I can learn all the bells and whistles over time.  So far it's wonderful!
"Complete and very accurate.  A little better than Turbo Tax if you have a complicated return.  Easy to install and use.  Imports well if used on the same computer, probably if another computer, but have not tried.  It updates often and prints out pdf's well.  Quite satisfied."
"I've tried all sort of books, audio disks, etc. and this product is the one I have stuck with. The lessons really help you memorize words inside sentences, and help you understand spoken Spanish. There is a lot of repetition in the exercises and plenty of exercises so you learn a little with each lesson, but over the lessons you really get good. This makes the process very exciting. I listen to a Spanish radio station (to try to get better) and after each lesson I actually hear and understand new words on the radio. I even know the spelling and accent marks for the new words.

If these people create a level 3 or beyond, I am buying it instantly! I am nearly done with lesson 2 and will be needing another high quality product so I can continue learning.

The software is also very simple, runs off the disk so no need to worry about license keys, etc. It is very interactive, and has great 10 minute instructor talks before each workout. I really wish they produced more of these!"

"I purchased 13.0 because 12.5 dose not work with Windows 10. I tried to install 12.5 when I got my new computer and it wouldn't install. I called support at Nuance. Sorry does not work w W-10. Don't you have an update to make 12.5 work w W-10? No you have to buy 13.0. Grrr!
I purchased 13.0. This program is very time consuming to install. Finally got it installed along with my profile from 12.5. Make sure to save your voice profile if you are upgrading. There is a huge learning curve with this program. But after training it recognizes most words. I use it mostly for word dictation. I don't try to dictate the commands. Way too confusing. It is a great help in doing my rough drafts very quickly."
"I bought this complete accounting software to use for the accounting solution for my new small business. The first issue came up right after installation when I went to register the software. I have a new Dell XPS with Win 7 that according to the box, is supported. Going to the Sage website, I created my account as required and followed the link to register. I got to the web page, but the page was blank. I tried again and same thing. Using my Win XP laptop, I went to the same site and there was the online form to register, which I did and got the key code. Going back to my Win 7 machine, I put in the key code and user ID. I then set up the program with my business details and closed the program.

Now the real problem. Next day I launched Explorer to check my email and while I got to the Hotmail page, it was blank. I then tried a couple more websites and same thing. No web content was available. I thought there might be a virus or other issue and launched McAfee. All I got was a blank white box instead of the McAfee dashboard. Other programs that were not web based seemed to work but anything web based was hosed. I then called Dell tech support and we went through an hour of diagnostics which proved the machine was just fine. The solution was to restore my machine to factory settings which I sure didn't want to do. As a last resort, I reset the machine to the restore point prior to installing the Peachtree software and when I relaunched the machine, everything worked perfectly. Got my email, McAfee launched without issue. all was perfect.

Bottom line is that I almost had to completely rebuild my machine because apparently this software doesn't play well with Win 7. Yes, I did disable my firewall and virus software prior to installation as the instructions stated....Since I'm stuck with this software, I may try installing it on my Win XP laptop just to see what happens, but I will definitely be looking for a different software suite for my business. My opinion, stay away from this product."

I've used Quicken for years and then stayed with Quicken 2007 because the newer versions didn't offer me the features I enjoyed. I'm thrilled that Quicken 2015 has those features! The conversion from 2007 to 2015 was easy as is managing my accounts. I'm very happy with Quicken 2015.
As described.
"I have used various versions of The Print Shop through the years and have always found it a powerful and useful graphics package. It is easy to use and a lot of fun! Versions 20 through 23 only have minor changes and improvements. I was almost forced into buying 23 because 22 will not work with Windows 7 computers - but 23 is just fine.

You can do almost anything you can imagine in these versions, and they have some features that I haven't seen in other graphics packages. Headlines (very fancy headings, that offer much more than just plain or colored text in various fonts); and tweaking photos where the original and the tweaked one appear on the same screen - you don't have to remember what the original looked like.

Beware of the totally new version called The Print Shop 2.0. It seems to offer LESS features than 23, and has bugs. (See my separate review)."
I  am using Quickbooks for more than 7 years. It is a great software for my work. I really like this software.
"Just switched our home and business finances to quicken from years of quickbooks. So easy, intuitive, great for budgeting. Invoicing is basic and works fine."
"Softwear didn't work.  Refund was given. Very disappointed as I bought a Mavis Beacon typing quite some years ago and it worked really well.  If the programme works, it's a really great typing tool."
Great Value - Everyone should have some sort of security on all of their devices these days
"Another fantastic set of scans from GitCorp. If you're a Trekkie, track this down. But it."
"I've been using Vipre for several years. You won't find better. That said

I ordered this for my wife's laptop. I was given the option of download and be sent an activation code or a boxed copy. Call me old school as I prefer to have a CD, I opted for a boxed copy and the associated wait for the CD to come in the mail. I was shipped a box with a slip of paper in it. Activation code was printed on the slip of paper and warnings ""Do Not Lose this Slip of Paper""....Really...a couple of months prior to ordering this copy I ordered a lifetime copy of Vipre for my desktop and was given the same option of downloading or order a boxed copy. I ordered the boxed copy and did receive a CD disk with that order.

You won't find better software or a prettier box........"
"Word is a great product as well as Excel and One Note. You must consider that Windows 8 has just cone out for PCs. So what you buy new, may soon be old.

Also! If you already have Office on whatever product you have purchased, go ahead and get the disk that way you can install on more than one device, laptop, desktop, etc.

Great price, easy install, wonderfully fast delivery.
You'd be a fool to get it anywhere else"
"What ever you do don't buy this horrible product, What a rip off.  H&R block nickels and dimes you for everything! It would have been cheaper to take all my paperwork in to a local office and have them do it for me. Cost me 52.28 for product, 43.75 dollars for a state return, 20 for efile and they wanted an extra 40 if you don't use a card. The software is horrible as well, doesn't remember my 2012 taxes, I used turbo tax online to do my kids taxes it was 20 bucks and I was amazed to see it remembered my taxes from 2006 and 2007 the last time I used that product. Turbo tax was much easier to use I was done in 30 min, H&R took me 6 hours! It kept telling me that box 1 of my w2 was incorrect, WTF!!!! how can this incredibly simple box be wrong, piece of s*** software! Don't buy it! You have been warned!"
"I just got this in today,looks O.K. But man what a headache,i've been setting it up for about 3 hours now and it seams way too complicated for my small business!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Complete disaster.  I have used Quicken since their first Mac program (except of course Quicken Essentials which had NONE of the features that I use).  I finally abandoned Quicken 2007 when my older computer broke down.  One immediately notices the completely new and perfectly awful user interface. However, the real problem is a number of bugs that produce false numbers for even modestly complex investment calculations.  You can, with some effort, use it to record transactions, but be prepared to check all calculations by hand.  For example, right now I am looking at an account where there are 1411.709 shares of a mutual fund at $64.21.  Quicken shows 1400.662 shares and a value of $220,768.70!!!!!"
Did not do what I expected.
Very happy with the ease of use and protection!
"At one time, it was desirable to upgrade prior versions of Money for the free benefits included:  1 year of msn billpay, free tax software, 1 year credit reporting, etc.  It was a no brainer to purchase the new version just for the perks.

The exec's must have felt like Money arrived and was ready to compete head to head with Quicken.  Prior users only get tax software, limited msn billpay, etc.  Financially there is no gain to updating.

The software has trouble functioning and is slow to respond.  One prime example is matching transactions to what is already recorded.  The program moves slow to almost non-responsiveness and cannot keep the visual on a high functioning computer when 1 selection is made to match an item and 2 the correct transactions are linked.  I thought it might be the size of the file, so I archived some of my information.  (Another difficulty found, since the archive selection isn't like Outlooks and you have to archive by duplicating files manually and deleting item by item.)  File size has nothing to do with the poor program functioning at all.

If you are looking to upgrade, save your money and forget continuing to upgrade annually.  I could tell little difference between 2004 and 2005.  Reading 2006 reviews, 2005 users were disappointed.  Since it is now a no gainer, it would be best to wait every 2-4 years now to upgrade unless you like investing in the latest software.  BTW, I have worked with both Deluxe and Premium editions."
"This product works so well that, my wife is all ready for level 2 French.  Just simply amazing!"
Mostly good stuff.  Sometimes hard to find what you've already done.  Phone support is good though.  I've heard that Intuit has been lobbying against simplifying the IRS forms.  That bothers me.
looks like it will be a great teaching tool for the granddaughter as soon as she can read a bit better. but her mom and I loved it!!!
"First of all this was supposed to be for 5 federal returns but the software would only let me file 2. I kept getting a message saying my limit has been reached. I tried to contact the company via online Chat and no one responded after 30 minutes so I gave up. The description of the product is very misleading, and even the software itself says I should have 5 free e-files, but it really does not work that way. The activation codes that Amazon is distributing are for 2 free federal e-files only.

UPDATE
After 90 minutes waiting for live chat I finally talked to an H&R block technical support person. They gave me a new product activation code that let me file more than 2 federal returns for free."
I've read the Bible before but never have I understood its real meaning like I do now. The footnotes below explaining each passage are extremely helpful and the messages are great for thought.
"My trouble is that I have MediaChance products and I am getting no support from them, They still offer stuff for sale, but as a registered customer with rights to `lifetime upgrades, I get NADA"
"Windows 8.1 is:

+Very stable, as in it hardly ever crashes, even in situations where Windows 7 often crashed
+Very customizable
+Very familiar - you can now boot straight to the desktop.  I have not seen the Start Screen in months!
+Compatible with your old software - I can run Microsoft FSX perfectly with all my add-ons working just as they did in Windows 7.  Many will say this is not a gaming OS, and I have no idea what they are talking about.  I haven't had a single problem with gaming on this OS.

I don't really miss the Start menu. Having thought about it for a second, I am not really sure I used it that much to begin with.  All my programs have shortcuts on the desktop or are pinned to the taskbar anyway.  That is how it was with Windows 7 for me and that is how it is now.  I am still starting programs from those shortcuts just as I did then.  At least in 8.1 they added a start button to the taskbar.  Hint: Right click on the start button.  With that right click you can get to most of the quick shortcuts that appeared on the main page of the old start menu.

I am at a loss as to why everyone hates this version of Windows so much.  At first I was a bit taken aback by the differences, but with 8.1 most of those differences have been smoothed over.  There is little to no difference in the functionality and capabilities of the underlying OS.

With the addition of the start button with its extensive right-click shortcut menu and the ability to boot to the desktop, Windows 8.1 is even better, in my opinion, than Windows 8 and Windows 7."
It is great
"Have been a loyal customer for years. Was extremely disappointed to find that Intuit crippled the Deluxe version this year. It is totally worthless to even the modest investor. I gave it 2 stars because when I tried other software I was disappointed and came back and because they tried to correct the terribly misguided choice by offering Schedule C and D for free. THEN, when I tried to file, I was unable to because of a glitch with Form 2441. The help section promised an update to correct the known problem and has not happened by the date they promised. I am stuck in a frustrating circular pattern at the last step of filing. I cannot delete the form or enter information to make it happy....still waiting to file. If you can possibly use another program - do it."
I was dissappointed that the version I purchased is for a 32 bit machine and I have a 64 bit computer. I will have to get a 64 bit version but I have not had the time so far. I will send more if I ever get it up and running.
"best on the market.  once you learn it ,it is easy to use"
"This has been the worst 12 hours of my life.  I admit I bought this because TurboTax was 5x the price and a little dishonest about how they got to that cost, but this software is to be avoided like the plague.  The easiest way to explain this is software's problems is with an analogy: you know how when you talk to someone who's really drunk, you have to just kind of deal with not getting a proper response to anything you say? Or when you talk to a young child?  That's this software.  Oh, you have a vehicle and want to deduct mileage?  LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THIS ONE TIME WHEN I HAD INCOME FROM FOREIGN INVESTMENTS.  What are you talking about? I paid you money to help me figure out the different ways certain schedules could effect my overall tax liability. HEY DOES YOUR MOTHER STILL ASK ABOUT ME ANYMORE AND DID YOU FIGURE OUT THE MONTHLY PREMIUM FOR THE SECOND LOWEST COST SILVER PLAN?  Um...that's not really appropriate, I am not up to the 1095 yet, please show me your ""interview questions"" for the topic I was just --HEY DID YOU GET ANY STUDENT LOAN INTEREST THIS YEAR ARGLEBARGLE BLECCCHHHHHHH

Go home, H&R, you're drunk.  Next year I will just hire a CPA in february.  This stinks."
Didn't really notice much difference at all in the look or speed....but it wasn't expensive and it did no harm so I'm not bothered.
i bought this so I can change PDF's files into a jpeg's file but it turns out that its not an option.
"I am really impressed with the ease of use and how it integrates with Word and Excel. I am a long time Quickbooks user, and choked at their latest attempt to gouge me with additional fees, so I decided to try Microsoft's product. Very glad I did."
"Amazon says I downloaded the app, but my computer says it is not there. I have done search of entire computer and can't find where  Kindle for pC was ever loaded.

Ammended review:  Re downloaded app , now it works fine."
"It works fine on Windows 7. I've not tried it on the other computers in the house but I figure if it works good on 7 then it will work on others as well. It was an easy download and things went smoothly. There is a free trial version you can get from the company if you want to play with it awhile before deciding whether you want to buy one or not. If you are into taking movies at home, school, work, wherever, you will really love this and have a great time using it. I have used other programs before but this one is by far the easiest to use. It's best if you do the tutorial unless you are already familiar with how to do it. I have used others but since they are all different I tried the tutorial first and that made it easier for me. I wish this had all been around when my daughter was born because I would have loved to have videos of that time period. As it is the pictures are fading and the slides are obsolete and useless now. This would be great editing school ball games as well or those special moments like weddings. I love this program!"
"This proved quite a disappointment.  It was basically useless, since almost every street we put in came up as ""can't be found"" [not the exact words, but that was the meaning].  This wasn't true every time;  it was helpful on the one occasion when we had explicit directions from a local resident in Granada.  However, when we had to put it the destination address in Cordoba or Granada ourselves, it almost always proved impossible.  Maybe we just didn't understand how to enter a Spanish address;  it is possible we were doing the equivalent of typing in ""Street Main,"" and confusing the device.  But there was not dependable way of finding this out, so we ended up looking up directions on Google maps before leaving, and then supplementing that with a traditional paper map."
"We are building our first ""spec"" house.  I was having trouble visualizing some of the details.  This product helped me put the plans into a 3-d model and now I have no trouble visualizing the house at all!"
Great program. Been using Quicken since 1993.  This version had trouble in converting existing files.
"My husband and I gave this program to my nieces for Christmas (ages 4 and 6) for their iMac. Despite how young they are, they are both pretty computer savvy and seem to really be enjoying Kid Pix. My only complaint is that it doesn't come with any kind of manual or booklet, which would be really helpful. Including something like that would be great to have. Maybe in the next version."
Great
"It's not perfect, but Dragon Speaking saves a lot of typing time.  It doesn't work well with the Sony digital recorder as advertised, however, but I'm working on it!"
I've tried others. I keep coming back to Turbo Tax because year after year it performs the best.
"Same product as store, yet much lower price. Will buy this was again next tax season. saves saves saves saves"
"A number of years ago, I entertained the idea of dictating my articles and or books. Dragon NaturallySpeaking seemed to be the most popular and perhaps most effective software at that time.

I found that the accuracy was shockingly high. But even with such high accuracy, it was almost unreadable. This was very similar to my experience with the Apple Newton. It turned out that very high is not good enough, and  proofreading automated dictation is horrifically difficult, because when dictation software makes a mistake, in inserts a word that no spell check is going to flag -- and your eye tends to see what it expects.

I'm pleased to say however that speech recognition has come a long way, and Dragon Naturally Speaking 9 is so much better at context-based recognition that many previous problem have simply gone away.

Right out of the box it was markedly better, and with just a little effort at training, it is is already incredibly better at recognizing my vocabulary, odd speech, style, etc.

In fact, even though I type very fast (100+), I'm able to dictate documents more quickly than I can type. Corrections are sometimes more difficult using Dragon NaturallySpeaking but there is nothing that prevents me from putting my hands on the keyboard and making corrections manually; and the more I correct, the smarter it gets.

I write software (in addition to books and articles) and for many years it has been my goal to keep a running set of lab notes while I work. I know from personal experience that if I would only write down what I was doing while I was programming. I could save myself a great deal of time (again and again I would fix a problem and then forget the steps and have to reinvent the solution; or I'd wish I knew exactly what order of steps I took that broke what was ""just working."")

Over the years. I've tried keeping a Lab Book, then an open Word document , and at 1 point I purchased an HP Jornada and made my notes in that. The problem with each of these plans was that I had to turn away from whatever I was working on to enter my notes; I quickly gave up on each approach.

My hope is that I can now take contemporaneous notes as I'm working using Dragon NaturallySpeaking on one machine, while programming on the other. If this works out the program will be worth far more than I paid for.

Who knows, maybe my next book will be partially dictated; sure would cut down on the pain in my wrists. In any case, I'm very impressed.

"I read that this product wasn't worth the money, but I disagree!! I bought this because I have iwork and nothing formatted correctly to .docx or.ppt the right way for school and I was frustrated. This product is so much better than iwork and easier to use than regular office for windows. Great graphics and fonts too."
"i was impressed with the display, turns pages just like a book.  neat."
"It seems like they have a great product here with simple to use interface that make Tax Preperation flawless. User interface is simplified, and tax help and information is there."
It was simple.  First time I have upgraded my operating system by myself.  The program from Microsoft tells you what will work and what will and what will not work from your current system.  It is only a matter of upgrading your drivers before hand.
served its purpose
"When my husband typed in the key card code a message appeared telling us to call Norton as there was a problem that was preventing him from loading the code. My husband spent the next two hours thinking Norton was fixing malware and even agreed to $150.  We now know these people were thieves. Thankfully, after hanging up, the thieves got greedy and called back saying they wanted to refund our money and asked for our bank account number.....my husband immediately unplugged the computer.  Long story short, we cancelled our credit card and was refunded all cost. We are elderly and not the shapest techies, but these thieves were really good at duplicating Norton ""help"". We spent a lot of time getting to the real Norton people who then ran scans to clean our computer  If we had incurred any big.loss, we feel Norton would be responsible.  Was this code corrupted already when manufactured in Singapore?  Does Amazon care we purchase the software from them?  Thieves should be shot in the towm square THEY ARE RUINING OUR LIVES!!"
It is an easy to use map program with no need to be online. I keep it on my laptop. But you do have to register it within 60 days.
Doubt taxes could be any easier than good old Turbo!
"I bought this product for making greeting cards.  I had used American Greeting Cards software on Window XP - which was the perfect program to me.  It would not work on Win 7.
I research greeting card software and the review site - TopTenReviews - had it ranked #1.  I thought it sounded like what I was looking for. But after I got it, I was so disappointed.  The card selection was poor and the was no categories.  They were all lined up (4-5 to a line) in poor order.  And there were minimal funny cards.  I feel like I am pretty savy, but this program broke me, I could not navigate through the cards and I could not find the type of card I was looking for.  After three weeks, I finally broke down and bought Hallmarks Greeting Cards software.  So much better and so much easier to navigate through the card selection."
"I purchased this software because I would  like to design my dream home one day.  You can do many things with this software, I just have to spend more time to figure it out.  The product was delivered on time as promised by the vendor."
"I am not very patient with computers as a rule, even though I have to work with the everyday, but this software is very good and does a lot to help organize my different writing project. I am sure I have yet to get the most out of it that it offers, but it is a pleasure to just explore the possibilities."
"I find it slightly less intuitive than TurboTax, but it is a much better value than TurboTax. Specifically, you don't have to pay as much for the various forms for small businesses."
"Like other Amazon reviewers we are dismayed at how remiss a dedicated cartography company like Delorme has been in updating roads and associated ""points of interest"" data on their premier street and travel mapping software, ""Street Atlas 2012"". Thanks to the building and infrastructure slowdowns caused by difficult US economic conditions since 2008, you would think that Delorme would have been able to easily catch up on adding new roads but there appears to be little addition of updated roads over our ""Street Atlas 2009"" version.

At first glance it looks like Delorme has all but given up competing with other online and stand-alone GPS mapping systems in updating their road database, but in their defense it's probably not easy to compete with the deep pocket operations like the freeware ""Google Maps"" and their fleets of roving camera cars circuiting the US and elsewhere.

Despite some needed road updating, Street Atlas does have valuable uses, and we continue to find ""Street Atlas"" an excellent companion for long distance out of state travel, especially with an RV. With a USB, GPS device like Delorme's ""Earthmate"", or their newer ""BU-353"" waterproof GPS unit (that came with the Street Atlas 2012 'Plus' package), even an older marginally powerful Windows laptop can enter service as a full screen GPS travel system showing updated GPS location, as well as travel speed, estimated time to destination, map direction, upcoming turns with voice commands, and the software can even suggest when to start looking for fuel or to stop for the night -- if these details are programmed into the travel parameters before you start driving. You can even set up ""Street Atlas 2012"" to avoid having you make left or right hand turns on your travels (adjusting the route to avoid sitting in busy left hand turn lanes as some delivery companies are known to arrange their routing databases) or to avoid dead end streets, or other blocked egress locations.

The main advantage of ""Street Atlas"" is that a Windows laptop (or potentially a Mac running Windows emulation software) can provide a big screen display showing large map areas as you travel, showing not only your position on the road but large sections of the adjoining countryside. Other GPS systems are much more limited in size and the information that can be shown on the screen.

Our ""Street Atlas"" laptop performs multiple tasks when not running GPS software, like web browsing, e-mail, and tracking expenses so it works as a multipurpose appliance when on the road. If you have the room in your vehicle for a laptop held by some kind of computer mounting stand, GPS software like ""Street Atlas"" is much easier to use and view on a large display than small GPS units or GPS software on smartphones.

""Street Atlas 2012"" looks just like its predecessors, with all the same menus in all the same places and the same quirky buttons for moving around or getting closer or farther from a spot on the map. ""Street Atlas 2012"" has added some easy to use popup type menu features over the 2009 version that makes the program easier to navigate and set up, much like the dialogue boxes seen on small dedicated ""stick on your windshield"" GPS units.

One specific failing that ""Street Atlas"" has always had and is still found in the new version is you must carefully choose the types of roads you are willing to transverse in the ""advanced"" route options menu, and if you do not un-check ""rural"" or ""unimproved"" roads as potential route choices, you might very well find yourself traveling down a rural dirt farm road or numbered lumber trail when there's a divided highway or Interstate just a couple of miles away (funny how Street Atlas will catalog rural farm roads in the middle of nowhere, but omit newer city roads that are likely to receive a lot more interest and use.) Fortunately, with ""Street Atlas"" getting back to a main road is as simple as making a few mouse clicks on the screen so it does make it hard(er) to get lost in unfamiliar areas, but it can happen so it is important to check and cross reference your routes before committing to driving.

For our out of state travel we have always purchased updated copies of ""Street Atlas"" every few years, but with Delorme refusing to update roads and associated ""points of interest"" there's less reason to buy newer versions of the software. For long-distance and cross-country travel you can't beat the many handy features of ""Street Atlas"" but for getting to a specific location after you arrive in town you might want to cross-check your destination with Google Maps... just to be sure."
"I had to find office 11 for my new iMac (license wouldn't transfer from old to new computer)- fortunately I found a download on amazon.
I tried office 2016 and didn't really like it (and at the time I had some crashing problems on El Capitan) I have found office 2011 to work flawlessly."
"It has a great variety. I teach Middle School and often play music ... I love all the playlist and the following of playlists makes it easy for my to stay 'current' with the music my kids enjoy. They also do a great job making sure songs are marked 'explicit and clean', which helps when playing music for students. I also love to playing the classical music or songs for focusing on testing days. I am just very pleased with Amazon Music and will stay on Prime for this feature."
"Do not buy! Compare to PC version, it is night and day. I made the purchase and regret every day since it is not returnable to Amazon. I still use my 2014 Quicken on my PC with XP, it is way better than Quicken 2016 on Mac."
this makes me very happy as l live in Arizona and it's hard to find this product for my business. My accountant uses this so it is great that I can just go on line and get it at a better price then from sage. Thanks
"Maybe I was just unlucky, but never could manage to get it up and running.  Not a novice at this.
Most disappointing thing was being shifted around, hours on hold, and finally winding up with the
third outside service vendor being directed back to the square one 800 number I started with.  Gave
up and just protested the charge on card and it was removed without a problem.  Maybe newer versions
better.  A couple of folks well versed in ""roots"" told me if you have a firm interest in this, just
go ahead and spend more money on Ancestry."
I was focused and downloading my ancestry.com information. I have not used it extensively yet.  My opniion could change later.
"This product sounds great when you hear what it is! But, if you have any computer smarts, you could do this on your own! If you have access to Power Point, you don't need this program! You can create your own! There is a VERY limited selection of cards and when creating labels, there are only a few choices for the different Avery label sizes. The ONLY good thing is the program already has the card and label sizes formatted for you! If I knew what this program was to begin with, I would have NEVER purchased it!"
Product was not clear on what system I would need to use product. Not satisfied.
I had this on my last computer and loved it.  Now I need it again and figured  since I have a Windows 10 I need the latest edition of Dragon.  Wrong!  It does not run on my machine at all!
Wouldn't ever want to be without it!
Have used this product for a number of years and will continue to use.  Easy to use and guides you through the process.
"I think the program is great, and am looking forward to updating my genealogy!"
I am able to keep a record of my home and business transactions on a regular basis.  When I do my taxes it imports them saving me lots of time.
"Great Product!!!Easy to install...easy to use! I have used other security software, but this one is the best so far!!!"
Fast delivery....great product!
"Just to let you know, Adobe Premiere Elements, purchased through Amazon a few days ago, is not working as I'd expected it to for the only purpose I bought it for.

I want to quick-edit AVCHD footage from a Canon Vixia G30 so that I can share it on dive boats and other dive travel destinations, where for convenience  I only carry a small HP Pavilion PC running Win 7. (I do my definitive video editing in Final Cut on a MBP, at home.) The computer and software met the Elements requirements as provided online, but playback in the Preview and Work Areas is so jerky that even minimal editing is impossible.

We have spent most of the day trying to identify the problem and correct potential causes without success, though my husband is experienced with Windows and with Elements.

I didn't expect perfect professional-level results from the software, but I do have some standards.  And, as you must know, getting any useful help from Adobe for this brand-new  purchase is going to be a daunting challenge.  Do you have any suggestions?

ADDENDUM: Turns out my PC processor speed is actually NOT up to that required by Elements, and I somehow missed it in the fine print.  $70 down the toilet, not a leg to stand on.  Should have bought it from Adobe, not Amazon, and gotten the free 30-day trial."
Great product especially when banking.
"I wish I had never ""upgraded"". I don't even understand what the heck it is, or where the basic functions are anymore. If the Surface and W8 are any indication, Microsoft has lost its' way without Bill Gates at the helm. And with Steve Jobs gone, there is a huge vacuum that someone will fill at some point, so I am looking for a real revolution in the computer hardware and software world sometime soon.

If you are thinking about going W8, forget it. W7 was THE OS for PC platform, while I think that either Mountain Lion or Snow Lepord are wonderful for Mac stuff. I prefer ML, but I am a PC guy who doesn't understand all the hype about Mac, other than it is way faster than a PC using the same CPU. Go figure...."
"Really disappointed. It takes 24 hours to upload three 12MP raw. At the same time, I rendered many full size jpg upload to flickr.  It halt, log out in evening. If error occurs, it halts, had to cancel job and re-add the jobs. Totally useless. Not continue after this year contract."
Product performs as well as past versions and meets expectations. Install was smooth and hassle free. Automatically uninstalled previous version and installed the current software.
Exactly what I needed to restore an old pc
"I'll begin by saying that, once you have a little practice, Captivate 2 will give you a very slick tutorial. I found I was able to get going quickly. It's fairly intuitive, which explains a fairly thin instruction manual. I use a Blue (brand) Snowball USB microphone that works great.

HOWEVER, for a piece of software that retails well over $1,000.00 (US), I'm appalled by the inconsistencies and bugs. In addition, I'm shocked that even though I reported a legitimate bug, they told me directly that they had no idea when it would be fixed - or if it would be fixed at all!!

I have come across scores of other little irritations that I haven't bothered to call in to them because of their poor reception. I routinely am unable to copy script text from one slide to another (instead I have to paste it into an outside text program like Noetpad, recopy it from there and then paste it into the other slide); my menus often refuse to stay open - I have to close and restart the program to clear that one up; and, if I delete a slide, the slide after the deleted one loses any script text which is replaced with the text from slide #1 of the show.

Adobe is known for expensive programs. But I thought they were also known for quality programs. Quite honestly I don't hate this program (I use it daily and get good results - now that I figured out all the workarounds), but I'm sure glad I didn't pay for it out of my own pocket."
"Video Capturing.

When video capturing you must understand codec formats. All capturing devices can be programmed to various formats. Formats most associated with DVD's are MPEG-1 and MPEG-2, and those associated with HD are MPEG-2, MPEG-4 Part 10, AVC, and newer. AVI and mp4 are only container files in which these multiple formats can be placed. These formats are highly compressed and requires very fast processors (cpu, gpu) to get good results in real time. If your computer can't keep up or are marred with errors then you have to use lesser compressed formats such as MJPEG that do not rely so much on the processors. The results, however, will be larger files and require much more disk space, especially with longer movies or surveillance situations. Even with fast systems, this is recommended because the resulted videos will be of higher quality. You can later recompress the videos to DVD's and HD/Bluray with even better quality than trying to do it in one shot. All formats can be adjusted during capturing or finalizing to achieve balanced results. Hope this helps."
Good protection for your system.
"For the Mac I owned at the time, this program was perfect for me! When I upgraded my computer to a laptop, I bought the next improved version of ViaVoice---which is MacSpeech Dictate! The programs are still by Nuance, however; and, there were wonderful improvements in MacSpeech that weren't known/available in ViaVoice!"
"Cons: Truly bad support, documentation of error codes is completely non-existent, etc.  They won't help you and you won't be able to help yourself.

This product has been absolutely dreadful for us even though we're using the newest build released just yesterday (5/22/2006).

The backups of files we select seems straightforward and the process tells us the backup was successful, but then when we go to restore from it we get one error message after another (both when trying to back up to DVDs, and then to the hard drive itself [just in case the DVDs was the issue]). Either way, we still have all kinds of error messages and unreliable backup of data using this product.

Oh, and if you need technical support what you get is you send an e-mail and in A FEW DAYS OR SO IF YOU'RE LUCKY someone responds with a canned answer that's useless and has little to do with the problem you've had to describe to them since no one will talk to you on the phone. (If you want to talk to a human you have to pay $29.99, and that's right after you just paid them for the product that never worked once.)

This is truly the worst PC product I've ever had the misfortune of ATTEMPTING to use in over 20 years of doing this, and the company has an attitude problem -- they want your money but they don't want to hear from you (or help you) after they've got it.

For some people the product seems to work, but for those for whom it doesn't, you will find as I do that this company will be little to no help to you at all.

UPDATE:

My problem with this software turned out to be the length limitation on file paths, and since all the backup files are in a tree branch structure of files, some folders plus subfolders plus file names plus the stuff the program adds makes the name too long for the program to handle.  I had to figure this out for myself over two full days (add that to the price of the product!) because Acronis doesn't tell you that (perhaps by including a box  of tips in the backup section) and doesn't provide a list of error codes and what they might indicate as the problem.  Tech support is non-existent unless you want to pay $29.99 per call, and all of this that I went through was completely avoidable.  In fact, I got a hunch the file name length might be the issue from using someone else's product which just plain SAID SO.  If Acronis isn't going to help the user the should provide the means for the user to help himself, but they don't, and even when they add features like the DVD burning feature they don't update the downloadable or web site information about it -- it just shows up as a bullet point on a list of features at the time of this writing.  You may have no problems with this, but if you do you are on your own.  Personally I would look somewhere else for your backup needs just in case something goes wrong and you need answers.  Good luck!"
"I am happy with the software.
Can do a lot with it.
Easy download.
great price.
I recommend it, would buy it again"
amazing quality my dad loved it it was exactly what he wanted
"i'm glad i bought mine discounted a Half Price Books - otherwise i would have felt cheated

first of all - this set is indistinguishable from other survival phrase tutorials - presenting lists of phrases to learn - organized by situation

but my chief complaint is that the voice of the korean speaker seems muffled - it's noticeable cuz at one point - the voice suddenly becomes clear for a while - i feel safe to say that i don't want to speak in a muffled manner in any foreign language

i'm kinda bewildered at the use of different English speakers with different dialects for the English version of each phrase - but it becomes less distracting as time goes on

a lesser complaint is the Eurocentric nature - ""Can I get a ticket to Prague?"" - admittedly i'm reviewing this while i'm still early in the program - maybe there are Asian destinations in later lessons - i hope so since i would expect to be asking about Asian locales while in Korea - not European ones

there's a certain randomness about way the phrases are presented - well - not quite - they fall within topic groups or lessons - so they aren't quite random - yet - random is how if feels to me since they seldom build one upon the other - the way Pimsleur does - but that's the expensive alternative"
"Great product, and as promised."
"I think Quicken is really struggling with the 2013 version. They're up to 10 patches already. The register is slow to save. The online services usually work well and sync ok. It does have trouble when categorizing downloaded transactions. I still haven't been able to use the mobile version. I just receive error messages that I have no accounts for some reason. (I have over 30) The sounds recently disappeared. I went through all the steps to make sure sounds were enabled - still doesn't work. Maybe it's an issue with Windows 8 and Quicken. Hopefully they'll come out with a cloud version, maybe that will help. I tried mint - that's even worse in my opinion."
"I've bought both ENCARTA and BRITANNICA for years. This is my opinion:
TEXT: The Britannica is a superb encyclopaedia in text since 1768. If only its electronic version were worthy of it! Text in the electronic version is different from Printed Encyclopaedia (large articles have been shortened). Britannica claims that it has more articles than Encarta, but this is a joke: articles like ""Spain"", are only one with a lot of subdivisions in Encarta, while in Britannica subdivisions are considered articles, and you must ""jump"" from one subdivision to other.
In some areas Encarta is better than Britannica. For example consider ""controversial events in modern history"" such us ""My Lai Massacre"": In Encarta one large article and a lot of mentions in others; Britannica does not even know the name.
In theory, you can update Britannica over the Internet free for a year quarterly (4 times), but this does not work.  Encarta is updated free EVERY WEEK) with new articles and additions to the old ones. The new articles and additions are included in the next version of Encarta, but this is not true for Britannica. For instance: ""Bilbao, Spain"": Britannica does not mention the Guggenheim Museum, which opened in 1997, and the population is !!estimated!! of 1982.  The same article in Encarta: similar text, 3 photos, 1 map, related articles, sidebar, dynamic timelines and 4 internet pages, plus one specific article ""Bilbao Guggenheim Museum"". I think Britannica updates its contents very slow, whereas Encarta is completely alive.
MULTIMEDIA: They say that ""serious"" or ""adult"" readers do not care about ""pictures""; that multimedia is only for kids. I do not agree, because I think that, sometimes, ""A picture is worth a thousand words"". Works of art, anatomy, maps, diagrams ... Encarta devastates Britannica with a lot of photos, paintings, drawings, maps, animations, interactivities, videos, music and sounds, pictures, literature sidebars, new translation dictionaries (not very good though), atlas, 2-D and 3-D virtual tours, timeline, games ...  It's not only the quantity and quality. It is the easy access you have to all the multimedia, and that text and multimedia are fully integrated.  Britannica's Atlas is a joke and statistics do not exist or I have not found them. Encarta's has a great detail: 1 cm/ 4 km all over the world (though you find some mistakes) and hundreds of statistical maps.
INTERFACE AND SOFTWARE:  This is the worst side of Britannica. In Encarta you only have to type a phrase, a word or the beginning of a word to see all the articles and multimedia that contain it.  If you have typed the name of a small village, you see it in the Atlas without clicking again.  If Encarta does not find anything, it gives you alternative spellings and you find what you were looking for.  To go ""jumping"" from article to article is very easy and quick, because you have a lot of links and the ""Related Articles"" section.  If you need to copy text or pictures, the integration with Microsoft WORD is perfect. If you don't understand a word, you can double-click it and the dictionary appears in a window.
Navigating with Britannica is different. You get crazy. I will only give an example: if you do not know the exact and correct spelling of a name or word, it does not help you with alternative or similar spellings. The dictionary does not permit double-clicking of words in the text of articles for their definitions. Once an article is displayed you cannot search for a word within the article. This is extremely annoying: you have to perform this task yourself.  One ""pro"" for Britannica: they say it works with Macintosh computers.
This is my piece of advice: If you can afford it, buy both. If not... read again this review."
fantastic deal. very fast. great screen. solid laptop. really good.
The product key did not work.
"This is the best dvd ripper you can ever find. Great quality in image and sound, lots of features and easy to install.
The time for delivery of this product was also fast. Highly recommend it."
"I have noticed favorable reviews here, with the reviewer asserting intimate knowledge and experience with this suite, its forerunners, or several other programs.  I cannot address how someone with a decade of experience might react to this tangled mess, only how someone with slight familiarity with a paint program or similar might react.

First, opening the box and installing the programs is a chore.  Unlike the dozens of other programs I have on my system, rather than taking half an hour, or so, installing these programs took the better part of two afternoons...it was if the developers consciously decided to find another way, rather than standards users are familiar with, to do everthing.  Particularly annoying this the spyware, in the guise of searching for updates, which is at least difficult to remove, if not impossible.  The tool which Corel, alone among software developers, seems to have been forced to put in their help files on their inadequate site, doesn't work, at least the way the instructions read.  Hopefully, with several manhours more effort this spyware can be removed from my system.

Worse than this though is the tutorial, presumably for first time users to familiarize themselves and get started with this product.

First lesson ""Using the toolbar to start a drawing""

On the toolbar click ""New"" button to start a new drawing...so far, so good.  This desirable state of events quickly ends, however, for the second instruction begins""

""From the Zoom levels list box""...and nothing more.  No hint where this box may be found, nothing in the totally inadequate help file nothing....the ""tutorial"" is then over for the new user.

Sit and stare at the graphic representation in the middle of your computer screen while you contemplate exactly how much a program which displays a picture of a piece of paper, plus took a manday or so to install spyware on your system, is worth."
Anytime is the ultimate organizer. I wish they would make a mobile app for it. Please don't change it. It is hard to improve perfection.
"Great selection of music, I listen to a variety of musical genres. I usually find what I'm looking for in prime music."
"And for what. I have run into problems with Intuit upgrades, though those were forced by QuickenBillPay no longer supporting versions older than two years before. This was an act of pure hubris. I have spent hours with a Bill Pay specialist who can not get the program to stop dropping passwords in a random fashion, My bank makes me create an interim four character password, though that information is unveiled only after any failure. (Even I can author instructions.) This seems to abort the entire process.

Just try to reset your password: special characters are fine on the web but NOT for software passwords. Was the programmer sleeping in that month.

Intuit is not worthy of support. I will be trying to roll back and obtain a refund. No recompense, of course, for the wasted adrenalin."
Updated from an old Creator; use it mainly for picture editing. This is the only program I found where I can write and correct notes on my pictures.
An excellent way to prepare your own taxes and save a few dollars over a CPA!
"I have used Quicken for PC
Do not buy this product. It does not work with many popular banks. The interface is not intuitive at all. I tried calling customer service i was on hold for over 45 mins and the call got disconnected. i tried calling customer service at different hours yet no one seems to be there at the other end. Even tried chatting on their site no one on the other side."
"Zero stars if possible. I concur with the other reviewers. I've been in education for over 20 years, and have taught university courses on educational technology. This product is beyond horrible. It's just a collection of multiple choice quiz items. Even the interface to select those is stupid.

Basic pedagogy dictates that first you teach students something, and then you assess them to see if they learned it. This skips the teaching part all together. The loud buzzer for incorrect answers announces to all within earshot that the student is dumb, and just adds injury to insult.

The claims on the box about ""lessons"" and ""tutorials"" are a complete lie. I'd sue for false advertising to get my $10 bucks I paid at second-hand bookstore, but why bother.

Run, don't walk, away from this horrible, horrible, program."
The damn thing would not install on my windows 8.1 machine no matter what I did. Total waste of money and time.
"this product does not save into AUTOCAD DWG, DXF files.

there is a bug.

Imsi do not have a fix for this bug, making this product useless.

Imsi website is a mess with lots of broken links.  The buildin web links have broken links.. even the one that suppose to update links to the correct links.  Imagine how much support you get from these jokers."
Love it
"I have had this review hanging around for awhile, but this program worked well for my rather simple tax needs. No big surprises, no weird crashes, just a nice, solid program."
"Software does exactly what is supposed to do and it is also very easy and flexible. The install and use is as simple, it also has a complex interface that allows for various options."
"My fiance and I drove from Rome to Positano (Amalfi Coast) to Pompeii back to Rome in September 2014. This map was very easy to install in our Garmin Nuvi and worked perfectly. One thing I would recommend is testing out the gps once you arrive in Italy before you head out for your drive. My fiance and I had the worst experience with that. We installed the maps on the gps while still in California, saw that the map showed up on the gps but didn't turn it on again until we were in our rental car in Rome. We rented a car from Hertz and the Roma Termini (main train station in Rome) and started driving down the street and our gps could not find a signal. So we thought there must be something wrong with our GPS. Turns out you just have to drive away from the train station and the GPS will work perfectly, near the train station there's too much interference and it will not work. If we would have turned on the gps before we would have known that it worked. Also, save your destinations as your favorites ahead of time and make sure you find out exactly what address you are going to because we had a hard time entering Roma Termini into the GPS. Lots of user error not error of the GPS itself. Just be prepared! Driving in Italy sure is an adventure."
Easier than ever - every small business owner should have this! Reporting is great as well. My accountant loves the way it works for him too.
I can not install the program in my laptop since the Philippines is not in the drop list of countries where Quicken can be installed.
I ordered this thinking this was the updated 2000 version(you know the one with interactive classroom/schoolhouse and the hippopotamus teacher?) but got the new 3D game which I don't really care for. I should've asked to return it and get the copy I wanted but I just didn't wanna cause a scene. Oh wel :) Live and learn right?
10 months later and my Microsoft office has vanished.
just as requested
great price
"BUYER BEWARE...
I wish I would have read these comments before purchasing.  This product does not work."
"I love all the programs in this package, especially the updates to iWeb and iPhoto. Read what the changes are on apple's website. The only thing I haven't gotten used to yet (and not sure if I like) is the new iMovie. It looks way different and I feel like I have to learn how to use it all over again."
Works well for kids.  You will be happy with this program.  Lots of fun with good graphics to help your child improve typing ability.
"NOD32 has won several awards on their great software. It deinetly barely uses any system resourse. MY vista computer used less then 50% of Ram before and is still under that range after installation. My dual core 1.8ghz pc is still only at less than 10%. And that with the scan running. This is a must buy if you know a little bit to a lot of computers. Not for the average user, unless you have a friend that can teach you. I suggest purchasing from TragicLittlePC. They have a great price and if you just order regular shipping, there will be a free upgrade to Expedite it.

Spent 2 weeks in Italy and France and it never steered me wrong. Did everything I needed. Easy to install.
"I am a MasterCook user for about the last 5 or 6 years.  Was excited to see the new version had compatibility with my palm pilot.  Was sooo disappointed when I got an error message the first time I tried to use that feature.  I can't see any improvements over the version I was using previously, which was about four years old.  So disappointed."
Beat the heck out of Word!!
Great. I've used other Anti-Virus software but I always seem to come back to Kaspersky. It doesn't slow down my computer and does what it's suppose to.
Been using Quicken for app 10 years this is a piece of junk  now they will not refund money
"I just couldn't support Turbo tax after the way they treated their customers  and so after using Turbo Tax for 15+ years, I switched to H&R block and admit that I was nervous about switching.  I have waited to give my review until after completing my tax return.  I am very pleased with the product.  I am using Windows 7 and had no problems with install or importing the Turbo tax files.  Navigation was good and I find H&R block to be more thorough in their questions.  I did have to use the online chat for a question and the wait time was a couple of minutes.  I am very happy to have taken the plunge and even more happy that Turbo Tax can't hold me hostage anymore."
A powerful yet affordable solution to my accounting needs.  Love this product!!
"This garbage is a waste of time, money, and will likely decrease the amount of years you will live from all the stress you will get trying to figure out how to use it. That's a terrible sign when people actually want to downgrade to the previous product. I have an easier time solving the Rubik's cube than trying to use this junk. I heard there was a conspiracy that Macro$loth wanted to change the interface so that once people get use to it, they will no longer feel tempted to switch to Open Office. Better to not learn the new interface and perpetuate their monopoly."
"I have used Turbo Tax before and after this 2010 version and I will continue to use
Turbo Tax to prepare my Federal Tax returns in the future."
"Math Without Borders Home Study Companions, along with the recommended course text books, provide a solid and challenging math education.  In each course, Mr. Chandler's clear examples and explanations really help when trying to understand hard concepts. My son has completed several Math Without Borders courses (Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2/Trig, Precalculus) and is currently using the Calculus course. He really enjoys these courses and highly recommends them."
"Purchased mainly for advertised claim of being able to convert 2D video files to 3D format, and claimed ability to share video's on YouTube or FaceBook...

Sharing from program to YouTube automatically allows you to share to YouTube using YouTube's 3D viewing options...  However, when trying to share 3D files on FB, instead of uploading the Anaglyphic 3D format intended to be shared, it seems to ONLY be willing to post video to FB showing side-by-side video images, one for each eye's perspective instead of posting the intended anaglyphic format video to FB.

To share 3D video generated with this program to FB, ONLY working option I've found so far is to save the file to your hard disk, then go to FB and use FB's own file upload options to upload the 3D format video file in the viewing format you intended to be shared on FB.

The rest of the program seems to work close to flawlessly...  But their file sharing to FB is SEVERELY LACKING in functionality."
This is one of the most useful and wonderful things I have ever gotten for myself.  Thank you that it exists!
"Wish I hadn't wasted my money. This product would not install at all.  This is the last time I buy any Symantec product until they correct problems and have REAL SUPPORT other than their useless online ""support"".  In the last 5 years it seems they have produced sub standard products and yet still keep raising their prices."
"DO NOT BUY THIS VIRUS PROTECTION PROGRAM.  On April 21 2010 McAfee trashed computers all over the country with a download that replaced a critical XP system file. I spent 6 hours on hold and 30 hours rebuilding my system.  The CEO David DeWalt promised a free two-year subscription to affected users.  Today, I got a renewal notice from McAfee.  What?  Customer Service said I had a window from May 10 until May 31 and I missed the deadline.  I had called on May 5 and was told they would have a link from the web site but neglected to say it would be a limited time offer. There are many freeware and shareware programs that do a great job."
"Quicken is overall a problem free and accurate program. There is one feature I detest! Entries copied from my credit union or bank statements do not remain in the order I enter them. I do all hand entries. Being human I do make mistakes. It can be difficult to find errors if comparing bank statements to Quicken, due to Quicken rearranging entries."
Used TurboTax for 15 years. Saw they used trickery and changed product this year in an attempt to scalp more money from consumer. Changed to H&R and found it every bit as easy and thorough at less than half the price.
"Bought this software via recommendation of representative - impossible to migrate from PC - Mac, three separate calls and three different answers - last one said I need to have bought different software than was I was told.  Unless needed I wouldn't recommend this product or company."
Did not need wrong item
I used this program for a couple of years and found it to be complicated and not dependable. I would not recommend to a friend.
"This program is absolute trash.  For a paid screen saver (I might add they want you to pay an additional fee to buy more fish), its quality is depressing.

Static backgrounds, no Anti-Aliasing, no Aniostropic Filtering, no realtime shadows, etc.  I expected it to be of game quality, but instead got some flat fish bumping around a static, low-resolution background.  The background didn't even look nice.

Clearly some people lack the system resources to run this well.  I do not.

Norton has a great solution for computer virus protection
"I purchased this software in March of 2011 and have used it mainly for converting my Sony Handycam digital tapes to DVD.  Now suddenly, the software has stopped working despite 2 attempts to uninstall and reinstall.  Support from Roxio is effectively nonexistent as I have tried to contact them and have not gotten a response.  I'm running Windows 7 and my computer is working fine.

As I need to do more converting, I have purchased another brand of this type of software and obviously it was not Roxio this time.  I don't plan on purchasing another Roxio product and offer ""caveat emptor"" to anyone considering purchasing a Roxio product."

Worked well
I have been using Quicken since it was first introduced. I like the fact that you are able to use as many or as few features as you choose. It is easy to use and conversion from one version to the higher version is always easy.
I needed the djay 3 software in a hurry. They sent it out just like promised. I've been using it for all my wedding dinner music and it works great!
Doesn't add value to any of the previous versions.  Doesn't even work as well.  I object to having to pay for an update that is as good as the previous program.
Item was received in excellent condition It is exactly what we needed to do our job.
"If you are planning to use this for your business or personal use then you should look anywhere else for another product, or just keep your older version of Office.  My company requires us to use Microsoft and we purchased several of these for a department when we upgraded  the computers.  I spent so much time just trying to get Office to launch on a consistent basis that I gave up after a month and spent a weekend uninstalling every copy Office 2013 and reinstalling the copies of Office 2007 that were used on the old computers.  Let that be a lesson to all system administrators.  Keep all of your product keys stored somewhere safe.

On the up side, if you flatten the Office 2013 box it does make an acceptable coaster."
"I got this CD rom set and it is just horrible. It is not even a 1/20th as good as Rosetta Stone (that's the price ratio). The games look like they were made in the 80s, they also run slow because they are all coming from a CD Rom. The vocabulary is merely okay. They show you the item and you're supposed to pick what it is. Honestly, it's not that difficult to mess that up. I was very disappointed in the voice/microphone aspect of it. With instant immersion you speak into the microphone, but the program doesn't grade/rate how well you did it. It just records it, so you can listen to yourself again. What good is that? In Rosetta Stone, the program actually determines how well you said it and gives you a rating, this really helped me improve my accent. Also for vocabulary, you can get an even better program and it's FREE. Go to SpanishDict com and their flashcard games are great. They even have video lectures, which are also free. Back to Instant Immersion, the grammar portion seemed okay, it involved you putting random phrases in the correct order. For people with a decent amount of Spanish, this program is also too basic, which I should've been tipped off on by Level 1,2,3. What prevents this from getting 1 star is the company's awesome return policy. A week after buying it, I mailed the product back to the company asking for a refund (because they have a money back offer) and a month later, I got a check in the mail. I had to pay for shipping, which wasn't too much. So if you're on the fence, buy this product and if you hate it like me, send it back for a full refund. In the end, all you risked is about 4 bucks for return shipping."
excellent product
I order the Trend Micro Anit-Virus and it come in a couple of days ... quicker then I thought it would ... my other Anti-Virus hadn't expired yet ... I installed it on one of my computers and it works great ... so far very happy with the product and the quick shipping
"I gave up on free software (AVG, Avast) for Kaspersky and it was definitely worth it. I had some minor conflicts between this and other programs, but it just takes a simple work-around and is something you expect with antivirus software. This is the first time I've tried the internet security version-- if the price is not too far from the standard antivirus, I would definitely go with this version (you can use this in place of Malware Bytes type software, it also has some systemcare features, and the virtual keyboard is nice)"
"I bought this hose about a month ago. It is as advertised, and has good metal cover housing a small diam. water pipe, seems the size of your kitchen sink water pipe. Because of the smaller pipe size, water flow is also smaller but makes puling away and storing much easier. I gave it 4 stars only because its not a regular size {diam} and anyone expecting the normal garden hose water flow to connect to garden sprinkler might get disappointed because of low volume of water being discharged."
"Can I say how impressed I am, a paper book manual...a thing of the past. I hate downloaded manuals for programs you need step by step help.

I had 4 photos really beautiful in 30 min. I now have my name and copyright mark on the ones I post on Facebook. There is a share option for various sites I have only used Facebook and it worked great.

I like it doesn't have all these layers you have to create. You just put the picture you want in the work area and adjust color, tints hue, angles, red eye, skin tone, whiten teeth, remove objects, fisheye,and many many more. Of course you can change pictures to black ans white, sepia or any color you wish. You can make templates that apply the same things and save them. I love you can go down the list and do everything on the one photo then save and share. This may not be enough for a professional but for the average person it is wonderful. I consider myself an intermediate to semi-pro photographer but right now I do it just for pleasure. I have some other programs and don't get me wrong they are great and offer a lot more than this one does but for the hobby fun level I like this one more.

I plan on taking some classes in the future so the other programs will be great. I highly recommend this to anyone who has never used an edit program for photos all the way to a pro who uses all the standard features for fast results."
"The main reason I got the Dazzle DVD recorder was to copy my VHS tapes to DVD.  Mostly I have instructional videos and a few old videos from a trip.  So far, I guess the Dazzle is doing what it says it does, but not without causing a lot of frustration first.  I had problems installing both the Instant DVD Recorder software, and Pinnacle Studio.  Instant DVD froze twice, and I had to restart the computer both times.  Pinnacle Studio also froze twice.  The 2nd time I was trying to install it froze when it appeared to be almost finished, it said it was configuring the software.  After about 10 minutes I had to ctrl alt delete and close it.  But it must have finished installing cause it was on my computer and working.

The first thing I tried to do with it was try using Studio to edit some mini DV home movies that I want to put on DVD.  My camcorder instructions say it can be connected to the computer with a USB cable, but Pinnacle Studio couldn't detect the camcorder and says it must be connected with a firewire cable.  I don't have one of those, so I went looking for the S-video cable to hook it up through the Dazzle.  Tore the house apart looking for it, but couldn't find it, so I can't comment on how well it works with that.  I decided to try VHS to DVD using Studio.  The video it recorded was choppy and the sound was garbled.  I thought maybe the VHS tape was bad, so I tried a different one.  Same as the first.

I couldn't figure out what the problem was with Pinnacle Studio, so I tried the Instant DVD software to do the transfer.  I recorded 5 minutes of a VHS tape (I didn't want to waste my time if it was going to be garbled too), it recorded fine.

So it seems after finally getting the software installed it does the bare minimum I wanted out of it, record VHS to DVD, but it seems I won't be doing any editing with the software."
"The product scans fine but I was never able to register it.  When I entered in the appropriate information and pressed <Next>, it just gave me a blank popup.  I guess I will have to contact their tech support or email one of the community forums."
"I purchased this because my lectures from school were so long I needed a way to get them typed up faster. I thought I could put the mic next to the recorded lecture, and it would transcribe it for me. WRONG! You do have to read quiet a bit of material so it recognizes your speach patteren before it will start typing for you. Then it still gets a lot of words wrong and even when you repeat, repeat, and repeat, it still does not get it wright. Not at all what I thought it would be. Although my daugher has programed it to recognize her voice and does some of her homework this way. I still find it combersome and tireing to try to get it to understand me."
It doesn't track an HSA account or my Nationwide 401K.
The one star is only because yes i made the purchase. .  was a waste of my money.  Did not allow format to do the reinstall or repair.  It was put back in envelope it came in to remind me of this experience failure if i ever think to make another purchase such as this .. .waste of time and money.!!!!!
"It's just amazing to me when a company's attitude is just ""sc*** you."" Sorry for the ""French"" but this product has been awful since the get-go. I was thrilled when Dragon took over, though Nuance is a pretty crummy company, judging by their IOS apps. But I bought 3 and though I didn't work well I soldiered on. But then no upgrade price to 4.0 and 4.0 doesn't run with the last three Mac systems. If you are a Mac user, avoid any Nuance programs until there is some signal that they give a damn about their customers and their products. Or maybe SIRI will get good enough we can just wave goodbye to Nuance with our longest digit."
"This is an excellent program for artists, especially for someone with a focus on comics like me. I even prefer it to photoshop."
"worked as advertised, simplified the whole process, I see it is capable of more functions - I only wanted duplicates removed which it did well. May go back and look at what else it can help with. Very satisfied"
"Slow, clunky, awkward-these are the words I'd use to describe Amazon Music for PC. It does play the music I purchase, and it does download them automatically, but only when I open the app. The downloads are much slower than they used to be with the old Amazon Downloader. The only good thing about the app is that I have access to my music on multiple devices and locations, without having to save it on alternate media. Still, this needs a LOT of work before I would consider it as my primary music provider."
I've used Taxcut (on both Windows and now the Mac) for several years and have had no issues.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relatively inexpensive home tax solution!
"Microsoft can do better...please fix these issues.

specially hard to work on if installed on a laptop.
on a mouse pad, if you hit the start button, and swipe your finger to the desired icon to click on, the swiping motion, makes Microsoft think you want to minimize the start button.

so let me elaborate that a little further.

your working away and you decide to pull your finger on the mouse pad towards the lower left portion of the screen to hit the start button. well your finger lands on the lower left hand of the mouse pad obviously. once you do hit the start, you see an icon on the right top of the screen that you want to hit. well, on windows 8, if you swipe your finger from the lower left of the touch pad towards the right upper side of the touch pad, it will make the start button minimize.

there are other big issues too that goes against normal functions and ease of use, but don't have the time to type them.

I hope these issues get fixed because I am a big fan of Microsoft and their engineers."
"I wished it worked as smoothly as the 2010 Home & Business Edition that I upgraded from. Examples of simple problems are:
- Even though I cancel the pop-up window, EVERY time I update the account the pop-up opens, informing me that I may have missed prior splits. Please make this stop.
- Allocations do not properly segregate retirement and non-retirement assets in the account.
- Manually updating an asset drops it to the bottom of the screen.
Just upgraded and I am fearful that these simple problems, that did not exist in my 2010 edition, are just a prelude to greater frustrations."
"I was going to do the auto download from Norton and I was disappointed with how much they were going to charge for it. I purchased the disk at a BJs for less than the restablish service fee, so I decided to shop. I found this verison on Amazon and read the reviews and decided to download it. I was a little hesitant, wondering what compatibility issues I might have, but I proceeded. Once I had it downloaded I again became concerned that it was only a 15 day trial and I could not find the product key. I went back to my confirming email with Amazon and found a link to their data download area and poof...there was my record of my purchase and the product key. I then went back to my computer and entered the product key in the pop up box. After I entered it, the full activation took place and low and behold, my subscription stated it ended in 366 days. I am still getting use to the new version and it's changes, so no comments on that yet. I did run a scan and it performed similarly to my scans from the 2011 version. I'll hold my fifth star in reserve for this part of my evaluation to come later."
"I wanted something better than a spreadsheet to help understand finances so I could create and track against a budget. The problem is the functionality just didn't seem to stack up. I could track what happens (basically just a fancy check register), but the ability to look into the future is very limited. I ended up buying Quicken for my PC instead, which has a much more robust toolset."
"This was the worst mistake I have ever made. What this did was to keep on taking my Internet connection down. Since I installed this my Windows 7 is all messed up. I am now forced to purchase Windows 7 again and reinstall my system again because the icons for the various programs will not show. They come up blank. I had to uninstall this junk and am using temporarily Microsoft Security Essential, which is Microsoft's own Antivirus program. I am now running Windows Ultimate, but you can no longer that. There are very few copies available of it and the price has gone through the roof. I am getting Windows Professional. I will have to reinstall everything from scratch. It's the only way to undo what this program has done to my system. Once I install Windows, I am getting Norton again. It consumes a lot of memory, but it always protected my system well. Never again will I buy this junk. I don't recommend it to anyone."
Wanted to upgrade my S+T 07 but had to buy the gps locator again to get full functionality. Not thrilled about that.
"not even $1.00 really, you can get much more for much less (free even) all over the web.

I wish I could give minus stars.

A series of slides with really boring audio added on so they can call it `video' learning.

And they don't give refunds if you've opened the box and seen what rubbish they've given you. I called their support and it just goes to a cell phone voicemail and they never return the call and their email address just bounces back.

Please do not get ripped off by this hokey outfit.

I wish I could give minus stars."
I find this product and all the update versions to be cumbersome in that the computer takes too long to reboot each time when loading the anti-virus.  I've switched to another brand.
"The software is very easy to use.  I did not have to read any manuals, or references to get started.  The software does indeed support many different manufactureres labels.  Anyone who knows how to use a word processor should be able to figure this one out.  It is extremely user friendly.  In addition to having a large quantity of backgrounds, fonts, setups, and clipart, you can import your own image onto the label.  The package also comes with a terrific applicator- it certainly beats memorex and neato's applicators by a long shot!  I would highly recommend this product."
"This is my first experience with H&R Block after several years of Turbo Tax.  My returns are straightforward, with a few stock sales and a number of charitable deductions and some dividends.  H&R Block was a few dollars cheaper, and I had a recommendation from a retired CPA, so I gave it a try.  Very simple to download from Amazon.  The ""interview"" format is similar to Turbo Tax, just a bit easier to understand.  Neither program allowed me to download W-2's, etc from the web, so no difference there.  Unless you like some unique Turbo Tax feature, I would go with H&R Block."
"I purchased Pinnacle Studio 8 and the Linx USB cable to capture a relative's wedding as a gift, based on the excellent reviews I read in a PC magazine article.  Although I was able to create a video CD of the wedding after about one month of hell, it was the most painstaking experience I've ever had with any software.  The bugs are endless, and the technical support is non-existent.  Pinnacle expects their customers to offer each other support based on their own trial and error.  I experienced intermittent software crashes (so I saved often), aborted rendering after 99% of the video was completed (this was apparently my fault for using too many dissolves, 3 total!), and glitches with audio/video being out of sync.  With every software problem I overcame, I became more determined to complete the project.  In the end I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the VCD that Studio 8 finally produced after all the time I had invested, as it was much poorer than the original filmed footage.  Pinnacle explained that the Linx USB cable allows a maximum resolution that is about equal in quality to a VHS tape, which I accepted when I bought it, but it turned out much worse than this.  Their new Moviebox USB, which replaces Linx USB in capability, supposedly offers twice the resolution, but I don't trust that it will work any better from the negative reviews I've read.  Listen to the overwhelming number of unhappy customers and stay away from Pinnacle products.  I paid about $150.00 for Studio 8 and the Linx USB cable, which I only used for the one project.  I will look for an alternative and never use this software again.  If I could give this product zero stars, I would.  It has no redeeming features."
now i can read on my P.C or my tablet.
"Blackmoor is a fun game! Great puzzles, independent smaller games (board games, cards, memory,etc.) that are actually fun to play (and this, I think, is something of a novelty, games inside of games), rich characterization,great classic story,  controls that are for the most part quick and intuitive, (important for impatient games like myself.) But Blackmoor is also smart. Ptolemy is here, Greek mythology, astrology (Chinese,too), runes, the planets including their symbols, horticulture, astronomy,gargoyles, alchemy, too. Jane, a young character in the game, is being tutored at the Manor in the ""proper"" studies, which include French, History, and some other things which are to remain secret. Sometimes on passing her door while she is in a lesson, you can overhear her French lesson, a real French lesson. Or a real History lesson, the Hundred Years War, or Waterloo. Also,each  other name and symbol used in the game is the real deal. Runes,The Book of the Dead, Latin, planetary symbols, zodiac, constellations. And Alchemy, genuine names and symbols. Fantastic! However, I feel that parents maybe should get a heads-up first about the content, because the game's target audience is ""10 & Up"". Some parents may hesitate to expose a 10-year-old child to these concepts. Golden Dawn parents, get this game! I gave the game four stars because, as a Nancy Drew game, there are a lot of clues and hints, in the cell phone, in the diary, Nancy herself, and some of the puzzles can ONLY be solved using an obscure give-a-way that can ONLY be found in the ""cheat"" diary. This is not Myst. But it is probably what a kid plays before he/she grows up to play 'Dark Fall'. Toodles!"
"I upgraded to Snow Leopard the day it was released and since then I've thoroughly enjoyed the improved operating system.  To be clear, Snow Leopard wasn't meant to be a brand new OS - as some have claimed - is was targeted as release because it updated/fixed many issues users had with Leopard and added some smaller features (e.g. Exchange Support).  Being a frequent user of my MacBook Pro, the performance difference has been significant, especially when running multiple programs such as Aperture, Photoshops, and iWork 09'.  I've also noticed a slight increase in battery life although I don't know if this could be attributed to Snow Leopard or the fact that the battery has been cycled properly and is now conditioned. Bottom line, if you're looking for a solid update to an already solid OS (Leopard), then Snow Leopard is well worth the $29."
I just purchased as I was happy with NAV2002 but this does not work. it only takes up space in memory and on the system tray. Autoprotect cannot be enabled since it causes an internal system error. The msg gives a link to the knowledge base for fixing this but it does not solve anything. Browsing the support pages you see user after user posting the same problem but they all get the standard stock answer that does not help. If you want to talk to a person its an additional $30. Since I bought direct I cannot get in touch with anyone for a refund...
"Working well so far. Easy to understand. Close to Windows XP. My husband finds it easy to navigate around the system and he is just a beginner. Only thing the key code was hard to read, too small!"
The best program for beginners very fun way to learn how to type
"We've had the earlier version, Windows XP compatible, for years.  But the recent purchase of a refurbished desktop from our employee sales program at work with Windows 7 made an upgrade necessary.  Looked around and here it was for 1/2 the price on Amazon.  Arrived a week early and we're back in business killing friends and relatives with my bad poetry!  Thanks, Amazon.  Really liked the fact, noted in a previous review, that our older cards imported with no trouble into the new program, so we didn't lose all those memories (not to mention to verify not making up the same bad poetry five years later, or, even worse, using the same card design for the same person again...)."
I was looking for virus protection since my Norton had expired. Even with the constant requests to upgrade its still a bargain. Eventually I will upgrade.
"This product was horrible. Never updates in time, or if at all. I've spent way too many hours trying to update my accounts, I could do it manually through the product, but why after paying so much for this product to do it for me. I have switched to using mint.com which is free and actively up to date. I wish I could get my money back but since I bought this online that is not possible. Worst investment I've made thus far. Hasn't worked for me since the first day I installed it."
"Be aware that there is an activation limit with this product (I think it's three). A hard drive failure, migration to a new machine, and other significant hardware upgrades/replacements count as an activation. I just ran into this after using the product for 5 years and Microsoft support would/could not help me. The only option is to repurchase the product. It's spelled out in the license. Boo. I will not buy it again."
"I have used Bit Defender for several years on many different machines.

It is the best product in its class, or was, until BD 2008.

This is very buggy software now, with modules ceasing to work and requiring reboot, until finally the software completely quits and you need a special uninstall tool from Bit Defender to get rid of it.

Their registration website has been down for quite a while, so maybe they are going out of business??

Or maybe they will fire the product manager for this version and get back to their roots."
it is what I needed to get my customer back up and running
"I have been using Dragon 11 for some time and upgraded to 12. It works so well. Grammar is accurate, recognition almost flawless. Great product."
"Just what we needed.  The '08 version works great with our Mac and has all the features of the replaced Office programs-with 3 loads it does the job for most home computers.  If you are looking for the very latest in the Office series then the '08 might not be for you, but for most folks who want ""word, excel and power point"" this version is just fine!"
not intuitive
Great tool for brushing up your typing skills and increasing your speed! Love the games included in this current edition.
"Virtual Calculus Tutor provides an interactive and detailed study through calculus math courses. This product carefully takes you through calculus with videos and example problems for each lecture. Whether to teach from or to learn from as a student, this is the best product out there."
"I've been using H&R Block since mid 1990s (used to be called TaxCut).
Using this software is like using an accountant to help you with your taxes (you just pay much less.)
I did a test in 2004. I prepared my tax using H&R Block software and also used an accountant to prepare my tax. The result came the same (I got the same numbers for refund on both Federal and State taxes whichever method I used).
I also used Turbo tax one of the years, but  I like H$R block more (personal preference, nothing against Turbo Tax)
Conclusion: don't hire professional help, buy this software instead"
"I eagerly look forward to each new edition of Streets and Trips, having selected it as ""best"" some years ago. The 2007 edition has - unexplainedly - introduced bad map data near me. Specifically, there are ""locked gate"" PennDOT-only access and service plaza service roads being used for routing along the Pennsylvania Turnpike in the Philadelphia suburbs. Clearly this is bad map data in the 2007 edition. Anyone traveling through this area, beware, as the routes are impossible to follow."
"If you have an older copy of Windows that allow you to upgrade, then take that path because this does not include a DVD/BDR codec - in short, you must fork over an extra $15 to watch your movies on your PC.  If that doesn't bother you, then this product is fine."
Long time TurboTax customer ... but decided to try H&R after the TT mess.  Software is easy to use and will import old TT files. Seamlessly imported my brokerage statements.  Filing is fast and simple.
I have used it every year since available. Much easier than Turbo Tax....
"According to my experience, McAfee sucks cause it crashed my windows xp several times.  Norton is good, although it couldn't prohibit some dangerous advertisements.  Kaspersky is awesome and I feel so good now."
Does not import from Quickbooks Online  Total waste of time and money.  Don't buy if you are using Quickbooks Online.  Don't understand why Intuit can't fix their own software compatibility issues.
"I'm now in my 2nd year of using Webroot and couldn't be happier with the product that is for up to 5 devices. Previously I have used Bit Defender, MicroTrend, Norton, McAfee products both at work and home for the last 25 years. At times, all were highly rated excellent. By FAR and away though, Webroot is the least invasive, uses the least amount of system resources/memory and the deep scan rate on my laptop is completed usually in < 2 minutes or less. With BitDefender & TrendMicro (my last 2 antivirus, antispam, antiphising & anti malware programs) it would take over an hour and in some cases longer, slowing down my system. With Webroot, everything runs in the background seamlessly and you never notice it only when the results notification comes up. One warning though, if you use the Permanently Erase Feature, make sure you do not need those files ever again, they are gone permanently!

Also I buy mine on the Webroot site since usually they have great deals going on. Go to this site for their specials:

"Quicken is an amazing product, for 1998. As many other reviewers have noted, Quicken really hasn't updated anything in many years. They just change the look a bit, add a new graph or two, and call it an update.

Most annoying for me is that Quicken still doesn't offer a smart phone app. I want to be able to record transactions on my phone while I'm out at stores, restaurants, etc. Then, when I get home, I want to be able to upload those transactions into Quicken. Is that so much to ask? But Intuit hasn't even tried to build a smart phone app for its Quicken products.

What a disappointment to watch a product die a slow death."
"Updates may disable your startup. Fixes for known bugs often worse than the bugs. The current creators update package created so many errors i had to reinstall completely. I will post back with an update to tell you all if reinstalling fixed my problem ""BAD SYSTEM CONFIG INFO"" upon startup after the update mentioned before.

Had enough, if this install is not flawless, i will convert to linux for good and run windows vms from my college days if i need microsoft again. I will take steps to avoid their buggy, expensive, monopolization of my time and money if i run into ONE MORE FAILED BOOT ON MY BUSINESS COMPUTER....

UPDATE: The issue was with a part of the 'Creators Update' having to do with some SSD (Solid State Drive) software or configuration. I spent 16 hours searching for a solution, only to spend another 16 reinstalling my software, only to have Microsoft Update install the buggy update AGAIN and hose my installation... ....you guessed it, AGAIN.

What's interesting is that while Microsoft posted a release saying they were working on a fix for SOME brands, mine (M.2 NVMe Samsung EVO 250gb) was not listed among them, but suffered the same fate. I have done computer IT support and troubleshooting for fifteen years and I can tell you, Microsoft's drivers and hardware support software misses the mark time and again. If you cannot get a proper driver from your manufacturer's website, your PC will get it from Microsoft's Russian roulette.

As I promised, I will be switching all my software to Linux from here on out."
"I upgraded from the newest version of 98 on a P III 450 that was bought in early 98 I think, and it certainly did speed up my system.  It also fixed some errors and crashes that I had been having earlier.  It did create some errors though that have been fairly easy to fix.  It would probably be best to call microsoft or your original manufacturer (or online) to see if your hardware/software will be compatible with xp before you fork out your money.  MS was very helpful online with one of their techs when I had problems.  I don't think you can expect to quickly get through if you want to talk with someone live though.  Some annoying things are the little bubble pop-ups that come up and can't be easily un-installed and the windows software that somehow wants to dominate your system and cause problems when you try to remove it.  This company does try to rule your system and make it a ""MICROSOFT"" dominated machine but I don't blame them, afterall we are in a free enterprise system and you could go get something I once heard of called lynux or fork out double to buy an apple."
"Finally I can run software that is no longer available or supported!  I use it for older games, and other products. I must confess, since my PC died and I've ""apple'ed"", I missed all the Monty Python games I have. They run flawlessly."
great product
Installed without any problems and was compatible with Win 10 and 7
"I was completely satisfied with Quicken 10 or 8 or 3.  I don't use it for investments, but I did want access to my bank so I
felt I had to spend the money and upgrade.  As long as you do this every 3 years or so it's ok.
I've been using Quicken since 1998 and I love it.  Just don't mess it up with too much unnecessary stuff."
It has cleaned my computer of a few viruses and kept it clean so far. Does offer a chance to upgrade by purchasing the full program which is really reasonable.
Habla YES!
it was okay it works nothing special
"good for ridding your computer of viruses and malware
only negative: will not do a defragment properly;  tells U that the defragment
might wipe out stuff U need to run computer;
I use the defragmenter that came with the computer; I think most computers have them"
Aside from not having any Led Zeppelin (Grrrrr) Amazon prime music is amazing!!!!!!!
I needed this software as I had to leave for an important assignment. Amazon not only gave the best price but brought the stuff before the date it had promised. Thanks Amazon!
I use At Home every year because I can import data from the the previous year and from Microsoft Money.
"Nothing but problems, crashed my computer, took 2 hours to recover"
Does what I need. Significantly different the windows version I was using. I also went from windows to iOS. I adapted.
"My grandson, who is three, just love playing these.  He has figured out a lot of it on the Logical Journey."
"I had purchased an older version of this program years ago, and it was great. Unfortunately, I never really got around to using it. Now that I have the time, that version does not work with Windows 7, so I bought this one. It is the same great program, but with even more features and it works awesome with Windows 7. It is much more affordable than Rosetta Stone, and it is the same type of learning. One downside, the mp3/Ipod download. There is a cd which is labelled as being for the mp3 download to computer, but it is just instructions. You have to put in the program disc 1 to get the mp3 audio off of it, and it only works with iTunes from what I can tell. The other downside is that when you listen to it in iTunes, it gives you the word in Japanese, but not in English. This makes it impossible to use as an additional learning device while on the road. I was hoping I could just load it to my iPod and listen to it in the car, but it doesn't really work that way."
"I have tried several Anti irus productas, but once I found Webroot I stopped looking. I am noe in my Third year as a happy customer."
"Bought 2 of these to extend my existing subscription with Mcafee on 3 of my PC's. You can't do better than this unless you get it for free. Started doing this in 2008, it's the only way to extend your subscription or start a new one. When you download this from the internet instead of the CD included in it you actually get Mcafee Total Protection instead of Mcafee Internet Security. Upgraded for free, you can't go wrong with that."
No comments
PC-Matic comes as advertised. I have used other PC Security programs [Norton and McAfee] and neither one compares to PC-Matic. Another plus is that PC-Matic is less costly than either of the others. I would highly recommend this for your PC protection.
"I purchased this ""updated"" version seeking improvements.  Even the maps were virtually unchanged.  This version was no help at all.  Worst upgrade I have ever seen."
"There isn't much else to say other than it is Office.
This disc includes 3 copies of Office for 3 computers.  This Office set includes Word 2010, PowerPoint 2010, Excel 2010, and OneNote 2010, which is all I, as a student, actually need.  I have no need for the other Office programs included with the higher priced sets.
You can also buy the single copy of this Office set, but I actually needed three.

Also, I bought it on sale for about 100 dollars.  That's three copies of Office for around 33 dollars each!  What a super-great deal!"
It was easy to purchase the item and receive the key code by the key code did not work it said it was invalid so now I'm just out of my money!
its turbo tax.  makes it easy to do on own.  great price for purchase on amazon.
"I can say without a doubt, this product is amazing. You get a lot of quality and usage from a product this cheap. While not as amazing as paint tool sai, it is an amazing product that can get you what is needed doing done with what you pay for. I would recommend this to any artist needing an upgrade from products like Firealpaca/Medibang. The interface is simple enough with many different features. The brushes are high quality and have features to ensure you get the most out of every stroke of the tablet. I love this program"
Keeps my laptop running well.
very happy for this free version of office.  WAY BETTER then paying for Microsoft office when all i use it for is document writing and spell check.
WILL NOT TRADE HDR SOFT'S PHOTOMATIX TO ENYTHING.PERIOD THEY ARE THE BEST IN THE HDR BUSINESS OF SOFTWARE BEST ALGORITHM.
"A significant number of people have complained on here that they had trouble installing X2 or that it locked up on them or that it will not run on Win7. All I can say is that I have used X2 heavily (on Windows 7) since I got it a couple of months ago and never had a problem of any kind. I had no trouble installing it after removing PSP 9.0 and it has never locked up or glitched on me in any way.

I have three 22-24"" monitors (they're dirt cheap these day -- about $170 on Amazon). I put all the X2 tool boxes on the left one and the Organizer (with all the thumbnails for a folder full of pictures) on the right one and work full screen on the middle one. I don't know if I could have done this with PSP 9, but I never did and I love this arrangement.

One of the windows I keep open on the left monitor is the tutor (""Learning Center""), which helps with any features I'm not used to. But I've had no trouble adjusting to the new format for old features which I've always used.

I'm not going to get into all the features, which other reviewers have done. I just wanted to offer an opposing view to some of the 1-star reviewers who say X2 won't install or won't run. I'm not claiming that it will run on all systems, just that it works for me. The funny thing is that if you look at PhotoShop Elements 8 reviews on Amazon, it has a lower average rating, more 1-2 star reviews, and a lot fewer 5-star reviews, yet it costs twice as much. Which just goes to show that you can't please everyone.

Bottom line: the upgraded and new features were well worth $30 (even $40) and I am very happy with this purchase. It doesn't even bother me that a newer version has come out, since if it had not been for the low price of X2, I would still be using PSP 9. I give it 5 stars to reflect my personal experience and the bang for the buck."
"Like someone already said, if you currently have Delorme 2007 or newer I would not advise upgrading because this version doesn't offer any needed enhancements that we use nor have I seen much of an update to road data.
I have had at the last six versions of this program.  Delorme needs to step up and upgrade the maps.  Major roads built four years ago are still not on the map.  The 2009 version stinks.  It looks like a giant TomTom on your pc screen, a real negative compared to the earlier versions.  The telephone numbers in the plus version is nice.  You can freak out your friends when you can make a list of a whole streets worth of their neighbors and their phone numbers.  Overall, I am not satisfied.  I always think ""well maybe this new version will have updated maps"" and am always disappointed.  Try Streets and Trips if they still make it or get a used earlier version."
"Loved the old CD of this but it didn't work on newer computers. Bought this updated version that claimed it would work on xp, but it does not work. Very disappointed."
"Well I have to say Quicken 2000 was working fine for me.  Got 2006 Premier Home & Business for whatever I thought it would add for me.  Practically nothing.  The nice one-click reports section I had on the left side in 2000 is gone.  Now I have to make multiple clicks to get the same thing (oh, you can put a up to 3 on the top bar but that's it - only 3 !!!).  I've been using quicken since before version 3 in the late 80's or early 90's and now I believe their programmers are just cranking out whatever they think is an improvement even though it's not.  I'm still testing 2006 after 3 months since I'm not about to quit 2000 without a thorough understanding of what 2006 gives me and takes away.  Too bad, the 2007 interface looks a bit better than 2006 but with all the troubles I read about I think I'll wait 'till 2008 to see if they fix the bugs/problems they put in 2006/2007.  Too bad, I was a quicken junkie until I saw 2006."
"I started using PowerDVD since version 6.5.  I upgraded to version 8/9 Ultra and found I needed to re-install the 6.5 version before the 8/9 version would load.  Next I upgraded to version 10 and found that I would have to install the 6.5 version AND the 8/9 version before 10 would load. Finally, I upgraded to version 13 ultra and found that I would have to load version 6.5, 8/9, and 10 before I could load version 13.

Cyberlink is nothing more than a company that is continually asking for more money for their ""newest"" upgrades.

Notice the shear number of manufacturer responses to people who have had issues with their software.  Take it from me - a long-time sucker.  Do not buy into the net of cyberlink.  You will get software that will run for a few months before the magical UPGRADE window appears.  Pleasse Cyberlink respond to this review, you will just make my point more clearly than I ever could."
"Very good product, easy to use and always gets the best results."
Not really user friendly
"This proved absolutely useless.  Impossible to enter destinations.  In map mode, it depicted towns but not roads. A waste of money."
"I am a consultant with a few (fewer since the recession!) clients and I work out my home. My method of bookkeeping consists of a once-a-year research project at tax time. I know I have all the info I need somewhere and, even though it takes a while to find and organize it, I have been able to pull it all together to do my taxes. So, I thought, if I have an opportunity to try Quickbooks, why not? Maybe it will make tax time easier and quicker. And, since I also use Intuit's Turbo Tax, this software would make it easy to import all the info needed for taxes with the click of a mouse. Once I started into Quickbooks, however, I found there was a lot more to it than I thought, and a lot more features than I need. My business is not complicated, but it is obvious by the number of features and terminology used in Quickbooks that this program is more for a retail business with inventory or a service business with a large number of repeat customers. It's overkill for me. I know it would make my life easier, but the upfront setup time is significant. Then, I'd have to make sure I keep everything up to date, and I know I haven't been the best bookkeeper in the world. My ""system,"" as disorganized as it is, is good enough for me with my few clients. So, if you have a few clients you invoice infrequently, and you don't carry inventory or have any real estate or office space issues, this might be overkill, but if you take the time to set it up and keep it current, I'm sure it would make record keeping and tax time a lot easier."
"After over an hour, its still not installed. The Amazon customer service rep, Moe, was wonderful and very patient. He could not have done more to help me resolve my issues. He connected me with Norton to try to solve my issues but he wasn't very helpful. I ran out of time to keep working on it so its still unresolved. I feel like I may need to cancel this subscription and start over. It shouldnt be this hard...."
Must have for Kindle books on other devices (non-Amazon devices).
"Waste of money: freq crashes, poorly writes code, cannot handle numerous files, and slow as a dead turtle.
1.) Comes with ""Total Training"" video which is cool, if it worked [needs Silverlight 1.0 to work, only Silverlight 2.0 available at this time and video is incompatible with 2.0].  2.) Tried to import a folder and after 8 hours of waiting gave up [folder had 31,000 20K pics and 31,000 4k htmls] 3.) Design View often does not show real appearance in web browsers esp with links making the view of little value. 4.)Trying to use Design View resulted in software coding what it said was incorrect coding.  5.) So I started using the code view.  Occasionally freezes in this view for no apparent reason, needing to be restarted 6.) To place the Dynamic Web Template on just 9 files took it 8-12 minutes each time. How long would it take my 170,000 html files? [Wrote my own software which did the total job in an hour--ya know Expression would have crashed again!] 7.) So I thought I could at least use its ftp to place the finished files on website.  It crashed saying it needed to abort.
If you want to write a  few pretty files, maybe this software will work for you. For me it was junk that just wasted my time."
"Does not work with Mac Sierra.  Causes Firefox and chrome to hang  and scans will not run . The recommended patch for issues with Sierra  does not solve the problem. I uninstalled and reinstalled Norton several times including reinstalling the recommended patch for issues with Sierra. Still have not gotten Norton to work since the Sierra update.

Update - ""Uninstall Norton"" from the Mac does not completely remove all Norton files & those left behind sometimes create issues with a re-installation. After researching, downloading & running the removal tool - RemoveSymantecMacFiles.zip  which ""removes all the folders that are created by Norton installers and any files within those folders including any you that have created"", I was able reinstall. So far Norton appears to be working. Many are having similar issues. Norton needs to proactively inform customers of these types of issues as soon as they are made aware of them. I have upgraded to 2 stars."
They continue to omit forms that were once included. This is my last year buying ANY Intuit products!
"Been using this software for a few weeks and I must say I'm very impressed.  I'm working with a small custom bike business and this software has a lot of features that I haven't used yet but it pretty much does everything.  I like how it keeps track of inventory, can depreciate our tools and other capital assets, and pretty much handle all my accounting needs.

I have been using some other 2014 Sage software for a few months now so I'm already familiar with the interface but it isn't hard to use and their customer support is top notch.  I highly recommend this if you have a small business and need some professional software."
Been a long time fan of Printmaster and very happy there is one that can load all the graphics so you do not have to change the discs all the time and on top of that get to save your work as a pdf so that you can email to people and not have to worrry if they can open it or not.  GREAT BUY! and still a big fan!
Disappointed
"Don't buy or use Family Tree Maker 12 if you want a family tree that everyone can see.  Looking forward to finding long-lost cousins and distant relatives?  Don't.  They will only be able to see your tree if they buy memberships.  How about your family, then?  They can see the tree--but only if you personally invite each and every one of them.  Anyone whose address you don't know, and future generations?  Well, tough luck to all of them.  They'll just have to buy expensive memberships in Ancestry.com.

Yes, Ancestry.com does believe that for a few bucks they earned by selling you their new software, they OWN your family tree.  They bought out the Family Tree Maker name, so if you have the old software, you can no longer use it to update your family tree.  Instead, you are forced to buy their new software, which requires people to BUY MEMBERSHIPS.  There they sit, raking in money by requiring paid access to the data that YOU put together.

If that weren't bad enough, it's a buggy program that syncs with your computer.  Do you KNOW how dangerous that is?

Instead, use myheritage.com.  It's free, and anyone can see it.  Use your old Family Tree Maker software to convert your FTW or FTM file to a GEDCOM file, and you can use myheritage.com to import the GED file you created.  Like the OLD Family Tree Maker, it's free, and anyone can see it.

I'm disgusted with Ancestry.com. Today I am sending my software back and demanding a refund."
I haven't used it enough to comment at this time. I had to try and down load it twice.
"As a long time AppleWorks user, it's great to see that Apple finally got around to writing a *modern* word processor in Pages.  AppleWorks had grown quite long in the tooth and the user experience was basically unchanged from Mac OS 9.  Not a big fan of Word (too slow, UI inconsistent with the rest of OS X), I had grown used to using the bundled TextEdit program which comes with every Mac.  TextEdit takes advantage of OS X system wide features like as you type spell checking, speech, floating font and color palettes, etc..  However, TextEdit can't do advanced things like multi columns, wrapping text around pictures, etc..  So the choices on the OS X platform were rather meager - slow an inconsistent Word, underpowered TextEdit, or old and clunky AppleWorks (aside from a few other third party tools which aren't very widely used).

Pages is basically TextEdit on steroids - all of the major features 95% of people expect a word processor to have are present and much easier (and faster) to use than in Word.  The regular OS X features such as customizable toolbar, floating font and color palettes, as you type spell checking, etc. are all present.  Moving graphics around is quick and seamless even on a slightly older Mac (667MHz G4).  Also, the import and export options seem to work very well from my limited testing - most importantly, it imports and exports from Word without any problems that I can see.

Sure, there are some things which Word can do that Pages can't, but most of them are not things I'll ever use any way.  I'd much rather have an easy to use and efficient word processor than have to deal with Word.

Keynote 2 (the other half of iWork) is also a great program.  I can't really compare it to PowerPoint since I haven't used Powerpoint much, but I have to say that it was incredibly easy to learn how to use.  The master styles are very handy for applying consistent features across your presentation, and the transitions and animation effects are nifty looking as well as easy to create.  The import and export from Keynote to Powerpoint also seems to work seamlessly.  It also allows you to export as QuickTime, Flash, PDF, etc..

All in all, highly recommended - especially for the very reasonable price."
The new version of Webroot (Secure Anywhere) is much faster and uses a lot less CPU than the previous version I had. Glad I was given the free upgrade. Thanks and keep the updates coming.
"I used to use Turbo Tax but switched when TT started charging more.  This SW does everything I need, and I have investments, rental, etc.  It's the best that I could find for the price.  It doesn't include the Fed efile option but I'm glad to pay for a stamp versus the extra $20.  And don't let anyone fool you, you can't deduct the price of the SW unless your business expenses exceed the threshold.  That isn not true for most people!
Recommendation: Be careful to get the Fed + State if you need to file state forms."
"As a former technology professional, I have been using Acronis for HD imaging for over 20 years. Given my background working on world-class and well-known enterprise and consumer software packages, I feel qualified to say that I have watched this product steadily deteriorate over that time. I can tell that Acronis is now nothing more than a marketing company, with some programmers in a 3rd-world country writing frankencode to keep the cash cow going. I have been tolerating unfixed bugs, instability, bizarre program behavior, and terrible network performance for years. Last week was the last straw. I stumbled upon yet another unfixed (undocumented, but known) problem in their TCPIP interface. There seems to be some hard-coded timeout for network latency, and if this is exceeded, regardless of the success/failure of the backup, the program will abort the operation -- AFTER the operation completes! After doing some research I found a competing product that does everything I need, is robust and stable, and costs about the same for a multi-computer license. Check out Macrium Reflect. They offer a freeware edition missing some advanced features, but the package is solid. The worst way to lose a customer is by way of a superior competing product. Goodbye Acronis."
"I had no problems with the Program.  My kids and I enjoy it  It crashed once but we had saved the game and just started it back up where we had saved it.  As with any game I recomend you save the game as you make it past milestones. My son enjoyed hunting and my daughter enjoyed the wild rides down the mountain sides.  ""Its like a roller coaster""  she said.
We have a pentuim 2 processor and great graphics package.  The program worked great on our computer."
"I got this for my daughter when she turned four as she was all about the Disney Princesses. She is now five and still loves it. It runs well and is pretty intuitive. We haven't done much with the making your own story, but she just loves to go through the different screens and do the activities on them. She has always been able to use it pretty independently unlike some of her other software. It is definitely Disney quality and worth purchasing, especially if you have a Little Mermaid fan."
The software does not launch on 64 bit computer running Windows 10.  Can not obtain contact number for customer support.
Will put this on my computer in 6 days.
"As a hobby on the weekends I run an AV team (five crew members) of gaming junkies that help run a youtube channel devoted to gaming and not all of us have enough discretionary income to purchase MacBooks and/or Final Cut Pro X.  As such it was a real treat to test out both Corel VideoStudio Ultimate and Pro X7 (for more information on Pro, see respective product for more) and we've had very positive feedback on the Ultimate edition.

Our co-founder and marketing expert Tom tried the Ultimate version and quickly discovered that his laptop was not only grossly obsolete (Windows 7) but most of the features exclusive to the ultimate edition are more gimmicky than utilitarian.

After find Tom a suitable computer to work on, he began working on a Legend of Zelda project using in game footage we captured with an Elgato capture card and some live-action sequences we filmed.  One of the first things he began to experiment with was the 3D plug-in and quickly disregarded when his new PC didn't feel like supporting them that and we have no need for them.  The other premium plug-ins were the Hollywood-esque transitions and titles but they still resembled something a high school or film student makes in his bedroom so they're not that great.

However, what Ultimate missed in its plug-ins it makes up for in its comprehensive layout and use.  While not as streamlined as Final Cut Pro X, it still had a very easy-to-understand layout even for rookies like Tom to understand and master quickly.  The software is, relatively, user-friendly and that is a plus to anyone that doesn't feel like shelling out over $1000 in premium software or Mac products like I did.

All in all, I would probably recommend Pro over Ultimate since the premium features on the latter are less professional than one would think.  I'd keep things simple."
"I waited for this 2007 version that came out in Sept to map our road trip down the gulf coast of Florida all the way to Key West and back home via the Atlantic coast with a side trip to ""the Villages"" just south of Ocala.  First, it has no information on any of the roads in ""the Villages"", just a black dot denoting it's location.  That was my first disappointment.  Once on our trip, using the maps from this new version, we left Cedar Key and looked for route/road numbers that were designated by the program and that I had printed.  These however, were not correct and we drove in circles for an hour until forced to consult our Rand McNally Road Atlas. The next disappointment was getting from I75 to Tarpon Springs, Fl.  Again, the route numbers and road names given by the program were incorrect.  We are still on our trip as I type this and not very confident that the maps that I've printed from Street Atlas 2007 will be correct.  In short, we feel this program was a waste of money."
Works and free!
"I am restoring an older laptop and needed the drivers re-installed. It took a few tries to get the software to load, then it kept freezing up. I am not sure if the problem is with the software or the old hardware. The diagnostic worked fine, but when it came to updating the drivers, it took 6 hours to do 96% of ONE before it froze."
"I wanted to get something that was a step above Inkscape.  However, IMSI has really limited this version in order to push their pro versions.  Simple extrudes can only be done on one object at a time, which causes issues with text objects that are longer than one letter.  Gears, something easily done in Inkscape are not available to the user in the ""Deluxe"" version.  For my CNC purposes, I think I am better off with Blender and Inkscape.  For me, the PLT & SVG imports completely failed.

I paid too much for a basic package that offers little beyond free software for my purposes.  If I could get a refund, I would."

"Running Aatrix payroll is anything but user-friendly. Aatrix goes out of their way say how Mac-friendly they are, yet the integration into QuickBooks is not seemless. I gave up, and switched my license to Windows 2000 running under Virtual PC on my Mac.

QuickBooks for Mac itself is the same as it's always been - a very forgiving accounting program with a decent interface. If you don't need payroll, I'd give it 5 stars."
"newnovelist isn't worth anywhere near fifty dollars. The story types/categories are extremely limiting and don't even come close to portraying the full range of possible genres that a novel can fall into. Once you finish the ""wizard"" (which is where you title your story and choose a category) the program isn't interactive at all. There are no prompts and the help is vague and doesn't cover more than the most basic principles of how a novel is structured. You learn more about writing a novel by reading good books than you do from newnovelist's help sections. There's no text/grammar editor. There's not even a spellcheck. The one saving grace is that it does allow you to take extremely detailed notes about every possible element of your novel, and to access them conviently while you're writing. However, it doesn't offer any help in creating a timeline or outline for your story, so there's no real way to bring those notes together. All it has is a universal notes section where you can write your own timeline without any help from the program. It's slightly more convienient than keeping your notes in Windows Notepad and having it minimized while you work, but outside of it's organizational properties, it does virtually nothing. Microsoft Office 2000 offers more in depth and useful advice about writing structure and style than newnovelist does. Because I already have it, I'll keep it just because it DOES help me with my notes, but given the choice again, I wouldn't buy it.
EDIT: I would like to add that when I emailed the people at newnovelist to complain, their response was fast and courteous. They actually went to the trouble of calling me on the phone to remind me that newnovelist comes with a money back guarantee. When I told them that I had done too much work on my story with newnovelist to return it, they offered me a free copy of the upgrade, which is coming out later this summer. They also told me that the 30 day guarantee is basically a guideline and that if I still wasn't happy when they send me the upgrade, I could return both for a refund. I've never encountered a company that took the satisfaction of its customers so seriously. Although I haven't gotten the upgrade yet, I've been told that it not only has a spellcheck and editor, but that it also addresses several other concerns that I had directly. I look forward to using the new program, and I'll come back and let everybody know if it's any better."
"my son really likes it.  That was my biggest complaint...the gaps between scenes.  My son gets impatient too, but he still likes it.  All of the other complaints to me were not a big deal  It's a pretty long game though and a bit tricky but it's entertaining.  Because it's so slow and long, we don't bother clicking on all of the trading cards that are found all over.

I found Pajama Sam You Are What You Eat From Head to Feet for $7.99 but then I found a 2-disc set of that same game with this one for the same price.  I'm really glad we bought that 2 disc set.  It's a deal, since it's like we got this game for free."

"I an sure, please don't waste money.
I wasted than I bought microsoft.
If you use the microsoft office before don't try word perfect. A lots of issue... Let's explain:
-If you save any documents and if you want to open on other computure you can not open. You have to buy it again for other computer.
But you can open microsoft word or excell everywhere online, even on your cell phone.
-If you want to send any documents to somebody, they probably can not open it. But outlook and i phones open microsoft documents.
-if you need help about software you can not find anybody, but their salesman always ready to sell, you can reach them but if you have a question they don't know anything about it .(I call them 3-4 times they help with just the e mails)
-I save a lots of documents it was company products with upc codes. * The corel software which is ""word perfect!!"" don't save the numbers with ""0"" , example: you can not write 00123 when you hit ""enter""  the software read it 123 no zeros. So I saved more than 8000 products (first I fixed the prices I worked 3 days) than When I transfer the follders I see there is no zeros so scanners didn't work and we worked for three days for nothing
-I talk them, I e-mailed them and somebody call me at 2AM from Singapore to help. He was probably 16 years old. He couldn't solve the problem.
-if you want to write the numbers on word perfect (quantum, fake excell!!!  for me) you can not write the numbers which start with zero or you can not COPY this numbers on different cell.
-EVERYTHING ALL FORMULAS DIFFERENT FROM MICROSOFT EXCELL, YOU HAVE TO LEARN AGAIN ON DIFFERENT WAY.
-IT WAS REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE..."

"Have used Norton for over 15 years without any problems.  THis is a great price deal (though I only needed 3 licenses).  On one other laptop, I tried McAfee but when it ran it slowed the laptop down so badly that I could do no work.  Deleted McAfee, installed Norton, everything is fine. The Norton scans can run and I can still get work done on the laptop!
I like the settings in Norton much more than in McAfee.  More flexibility in timing of scans, etc.
I highly recommend Norton."
"If you have a computer with any newer version of Microsoft, i.e. ""Home and Student"" or etc. you can use this upgrade item.  It sure beats buying the costly ""All In One"" Microsoft Office. I like it very much!"
"Without reading the manual at all, I was up and running quickly.  Have used other programs for
editing such as Corel Photopaint, Photoshop, etc.  I have some experience in using these types of
programs.  I found this program has a very fast learning curve.  Loved the way you can pick a pixel and then assign brightness, contrast, saturation, and color variations that can be held to
a less than compltete or complete picture area.  This is amazing compated to other programs that require masking or other types of techniques.  This alone, in my estimation, makes this program
worth the dollars.  I highly recommend this to any level of photographic enthusiast from just started to professional."
GREAT ITEM FOR BLACK HISTORY MONTH FOR CHURCH CELEBRATION.
"Good thing this was free because I uninstalled it right away. I am not out of any money, but I sure want the hours of my life back used to get rid of it, once installed.  It is tantamount to junk software with its grubby little fingers into everything. It really made my anti-virus suite nervous and it was practically useless for what it was intended.  I had to get another uninstaller to remove this IObit thing.  Seriously?!?!?!"
"It didn't work because the seller did a really great job and refunding my money.  I really wanted the software but it keep asking for a  license number and it was really cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for."
Quick and easy purchase. A bit expensive but totally worth it if you're a student or you work for a business that requires these programs. Definitely worth the money.
use norton for many years price could or should be lower
Repeat customer...I buy this product every year.
"I'm happy to say that I am -- for the most part -- very pleased with this upgrade so far.  I came from Vista 32-bit, and I have now officially entered the 64-bit era by installing Windows 7 x64.  For quite a few months I read about people's experiences with the betas and release candidates, and was excited about the good news I kept hearing.  I decided to just be patient and put in for my pre-order like most people did, which meant waiting for the October 22nd release date.

Let's go through this topic by topic...

INSTALLATION: It was easy, almost too easy.  For some reason I was half expecting to wait more than an hour to get this on my machine, but instead I was up and running in roughly 25 minutes or so (I performed a clean install, not an upgrade).  And on top of that, all of my primary devices were recognized (see the end of my review for complete system specs).  The Windows Easy Transfer utility was an enormous help in getting my user identity and files into my new configuration.

USER INTERFACE: Personally I thought Vista was very handsome, what with its transparency, 3-D effects, color schemes, and usability improvements to Windows Explorer, and I believe Windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy -- if not more -- while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements.  It just seems like a great deal of effort was put forth into making everything slick, polished, and logically consistent, and I've already fallen in love with many of the additional improvements, such as the revamped and more versatile taskbar, jump lists, and customizable themes.  I haven't yet become accustomed to some features like Aero Shake, but hey, those things are there if I need them.  But the clean, ""keep it simple"" approach, the attention to detail, and even minimalism in certain areas is certainly appreciated.  And sure, some people might scoff at the shiny facade and dismiss certain parts of it as being ""bells and whistles,"" but honestly, isn't it actually USEFUL to have the ability to see full-screen previews of running applications, or to be able to hide all of your open windows and take a quick glance at what's underneath?  All of these niceties simply add up to a more functional and usable desktop.

PERFORMANCE: I think it's actually better than Vista.  Overall the system feels more responsive and, well, ""snappier"" (especially with regards to video performance).  Gaming is as smooth as could be.  No complaints as far as startup, shutdown, and resuming from sleep mode are concerned.

STABILITY: Very good, but I'll give 7 an A- here.  I got just ONE blue screen of death so far, and that was during the installation of a particular piece of software (I forget what it was to be honest -- maybe a browser plug-in).  Other than that, it's been rock-solid, with absolutely no crashes.  I've even gone through some software development debugging sessions in which the program I was working on was repeatedly throwing up on me, and Windows 7 recovered gracefully every time.

SOFTWARE COMPATIBILITY: Pretty high marks, but not perfect.  I think some of it has to do with my transition to 64-bit anyways, like the fact that I'm having trouble with a specific component in Visual Basic 5 (I use it to support a piece of software I designed for work).  No big deal, though -- I'm going to circumvent it by using my copy of Windows XP in Sun's VirtualBox to run it, so problem solved.  Another issue I had was the fact that the installation of Samsung Media Studio 5 (for my MP3 player) causes Windows Media Player to fail to launch when I try to open a media file, but again, that's not a show-stopper because I can manipulate that device directly in the OS anyways without that application.  And don't laugh, but it looks like I might have to give up Publisher 95.  Heh heh ... yeah, I've been using that program for years now to do miscellaneous desktop publishing, but guess what?  Its installer is 16-bit.  So again, that's a 64-bit lack of support for 16-bit issue, not really a problem with Windows 7 per se.  Plus I guess I could still run it in my virtual XP machine if I wanted to.  Other than those snags I just mentioned, the majority of my applications and games run just fine -- and thank goodness Cakewalk Music Creator still works with my MIDI and audio interface devices.

WINDOWS LIVE ESSENTIALS: I guess it was a smart move on behalf of MS.  A little less bloat for people who would rather choose alternatives to those programs, but still available as a free download.  Personally I feel that Microsoft has been blessed with a lot of talented people who are really experts at design -- the basic necessities such as Live Mail and Calendar (and all of the other apps) are wonderful in my opinion.

OTHING THINGS I LIKE: The Devices section in the Control Panel is now much better, and ejecting USB devices is quicker and easier.  User switching works flawlessly.  I'm a big fan of the ""ribbon,"" which is the new user interface mechanism and visual style that is incorporated into the built-in tools such as Paint and WordPad -- I find it to be very fresh and innovative.  I'm looking forward to upgrading from Office XP to Office 2010!  (Even Calculator is better!)

BUGS OR QUIRKS: The link for opening the backup applet is broken, but not when it is launched via the new Action Center.  Also, unlike in Vista, Mozilla Firefox seems to have developed this strange problem of occasionally reporting that it can't find the server when I try to connect to certain websites that are listed in the results of a Google search -- but when I click the browser's ""back"" button, the site will then appear (and usually sites load properly when they are opened via the Bookmarks menu or through other search engines).  Internet Explorer 8 doesn't exhibit this behavior at all, and the problem has started to bother me so much that I finally decided to install Google Chrome as my default browser (I tried resetting my router, and it didn't seem to have any effect).

In summary, I think Microsoft did the right thing by listening to its users and trying to correct Vista's shortcomings, whether real or just perceived.  I can't say this is a revolution; it's more like evolution (boy, how many times has THAT been said about a software product?).  But to me it's a step in the right direction, and if things stay the course, Windows could have a bright future.

"I have all 50 of the DeLorme State map books.  They have good topo features and decent references to parks, points of interest, etc.  When DeLorme put the maps on a disk with a GPS connection I thought navigating would be a breeze.  I cannot tell you how much time I have wasted plotting routes on this software.  I used it on a 22,000 mile road trip/photo shoot in 2005. I work in out-of-the-way areas.  The database maps (both street and topo)have no detail in national or state parks.  They generally do not even show where the visitor centers are located. They do not show the points of interest in the parks.  They are just big green blobs on the screen with a line running through showing the basic road that transverses the park land.  The maps have absolutely no topo features like the books.  That is another software subscription.  The Topo map program (which I also bought for the 2005 trip) did not have the trip planning functionality that the road atlas program has and does not provide worthwhile topo features in the public lands.  The topo program is almost amatureish in its renderings and if you want to use the split map and see an elevated view, you get very little useful information for planning.  Certainly, with national lands and the trails in them being absent from the data bases of both the street and topo products, it offers minimal help to the hiker.
Notwithstanding my dissatisfaction with the 2005 street and topo products, before I embarked on the current journey (I have been on the road 2 1/2 months as I write), I bought the 2008 street map disc (it is not an upgrade, you buy new each time).  As with the 2005 version, the GPS periodically tells me that I am off route, as the cursor shows me tracking across farm fields, etc., maybe where the road used to go years ago. Frustrated by all of this, I went back to my Garmin Quest.  It also leaves a lot to be desired but it is more reliable.  If you get the DeLorme gps, spend at least a day learning the basic functions. There is little intuitive about its operation. Spend another day in your computer setting your waypoints (roads, towns, addresses, etc.)that you may be traveling the next few weeks and run a couple tests to see how well the program maps your route.  I often have to go into the route and force the most direct route by adding via/waypoints along the way that simply looking at the map makes clear.  If you try to do this while traveling, you will spend more time on your computer than driving.  I am on a 6 month journey right now and have simply removed the DeLorme programs from my computer and only rely on the Garmin to get me through or around metropolitan areas.  Otherwise the paper DeLorme state atlases and basic state maps guide me.  Finally, don't rely on the program to have up to date comprehensive info on lodging, points of interest, etc.  All have some, but in the last month none of the programs have guided me to one location where I ended up spending the night. For every one RV park that showed up from the data base, I saw one or two more in the same area that were better.  And if you have an ""air card"" for your laptop, you can use the Google maps and get traffic info along the way."
"I highly recommend Kaspersky over McAfee and Norton. I've used all three products and Kaspersky is the only one that has not slowed down my computer and still be effective. However, I did have an issue with the program in August 2008. The product completely stopped working and my PC Tools Spyware Doctor program caught the virus before it spread, but it originate from Kaspersky. THe product works but customer service needs some major work."
"I could say this product really stinks if I didn't think my issues stemmed from just a bad virus.  My computer was hit hard by a virus.  I found it while using a Virus detection application and it damaged my files so bad that on reboot, it couldn't find my hard drive.  I ran scandisk from a boot up disk and that proceeded to make matters worse.  I then found out about this product and what I read made me believe it would work.  It found many files but as it warns, found files are not always recoverable files.  Try to avoid ever having to buy somethign like this; get a good virus protection software and back up your important files."
"Because I've used TaxCut for over ten years, H&R Block's ""At Home"" came in the mail automatically.  Popped the disc into the drive and started the install.  A nice blue window popped up, but never populated with buttons, widgets, choices, text, or anything.  Nada.  Doesn't inspire much confidence in the product.  The product will simply not install.  It appears other reviewers are having difficulty with this product as well.

Okay, then let's check out TurboTax.  Reviews for that product are not much better.

Only other choice appears to be OnePriceTaxes, but all five of their reviews smell fishy.  They are all five star, brief, lots of exclamation marks and sound like marketing pitches.  Each of the five reviewers have not reviewed a single other product on Amazon.

Looks like I'll have to wait a couple of months to see who gets their lousy software working first before I buy."
"I have purchased Easy Media Creator 8, 9 and now 10. I have been disappointed with them all but have always given Roxio a second chance with each new release.

I recorded a TV musical in MPEG2 format.

I used Roxio's MyDVD to make the DVD's. So far these are the problems you can expect to see when using this program:

All the video is un-synced to the audio by half a second. It did not matter whether I used MPEG2 video or WMV video files.

What you see on the screen is not what you get. Even though I meticulously manually made every chapter marker, the program decided to place them all one second ahead where I chose, creating unintended effects and losing the impact intended.

The video quality varies and looks acceptable in some sections and looks unacceptable in others.

Yesterday my first DVD attempt, for this project, produced a DVD that did not start at the beginning the the movie, even though I tested the playback of the DVD on the DVD Menu tester. It was supposed to start at the beginning as designed. Instead it started five minutes into the DVD, which was not even a chapter marker location. In fact, with that DVD I did yesterday I had not set up any chapter markers.

Conclusion: Roxio MyDVD is a program to be avoided. It is unreliable and therefore unusable. If one program is unreliable in the suite, how can anyone trust the rest of the software? I have uninstalled the suite for good."
"I successfully installed Vista Home Basic on my laptop, and whilst being far from overwhelmed with the product nevertheless believed it to be a step up from XP**.  I then decided to 'upgrade' my desktop PC to Vista Home Premium, and boy I am wishing I had never even started that process.  I used Upgrade Advisor, and confirmed that my PC was fine, and then satisfactorily installed Vista, but then the problems started.  First off: Vista is significantly slower than XP, and that slowness becomes creeping until your PC virtually stops to allow Vista to do basic chores one takes for granted in XP.  Suddenly, your PC can spring back into life, and all seems okay, then ..... back into the slow lane again.  Also, Vista has fallen into the Adobe trap - it is much more invasive than XP and wants to take control of your life, not just your PC.

Pehaps I could have adjusted to its way of doing things, after all at 40 something years old, I'm no young Turk, and the onset of grey hairs and a fear of social networking makes me a techno-geriatric, however Vista gave me no opportunity to adjust.  You see the software kept crashing!  When I say crashing, I mean that the PC would switch itself off and re-boot (I don't mean anything so gentlemanly as log-off or shut down, I mean power off in an instant).  It kept doing this, and I could find no pattern to its decision making in this respect.  Plug in a thumb drive - CRASH!  Adjust a couple of photos in Photoshop - CRASH!  Browse the web - hmm, seems to like this .... - CRASH!.  I didn't try everything I could to solve the problem, but I gave it a good attempt for a couple of weeks, and I have no patience left in my soul for the condescending remarks of an ultimately hopeless support system.

My PC worked fine for a long time with XP.  My PC now seems to be working fine again - with XP.  Yes, the solution for me was to scrub Vista and re-install XP.  Hey Vista looks nicer/more contemporary or whatever, but XP works.

In summary, if you are thinking about upgrading to Vista, please think long and hard.  It is prettier than XP, but it offers very little added functionality.  The killer though, is that it is very unreliable - you may be lucky, but in my view luck should have nothing to do with it.  An operating system should work, all the time.  Vista doesn't.

**  The reason for me moving to Vista was for the much better sound capability it offers.  I use my laptop as a music player through my main hifi and Vista's handling of high quality sound is much better than XP.  On my laptop Vista has been a success.

So there we go - one reasonably competent computer user, and a 50% success rate at switching to Vista."
"This software lived up to the promotion.  The Accountant version has many new and improved features that have long been requested by accountants and bookkeepers, including being able to revert to older versions of QB."
Library very limited and small per ea big artist or lack there of.
It works perfect year after year. I highly recommend.
I ordered the paper port software because the (very) old software included with my Brother MFC died.  The new sw loaded quickly and worked immediately. Easy to move to folders. Clean results.
Avasti is a great product.  I have recommended it to many and they all love it also.  thanks!
Very easy to install and very easy to use. I would recommend it over Norton. It's a bit cheaper too.
"Ive been using this system on the Mac for a good while and had to leave a review.  It makes receipt storage a breeze.  The scanner is minimal in size and easy to use.  Receipts scan quickly and can easily be retrieved and printed if need be.  The accompanying software runs without any problem.  Fills all of your digital storage needs.  Works for essentially anything you need scan, organize and save."
License key worked with latest version of Smart Security for 1 year of updates (download the installer from ESET's website and then enter license key during installation). Threw away the CD.
Love this
"Working with Final Cut Express

Creating titles and credits with Express is important. The key is the Video Generator. You can create synthesized clips that you superimpose over your existing video clips in the Final Cut Express Timeline.

For good-looking titles, you can use san serif fonts such as Arial, Futura, Gill Sans, Helvetica and Impact. I have found using bold, red or blue 30 point fonts effective for my titles.

You need to watch for the 20 percent factor. The 'Title Save Boundary' is 20 percent smaller than your television screen. To see the boundaries in Final Cut Express, go to View then to Show Title. Best to keep your titles within the safe zone.

Final Cut Express allows you to create rolling credits like the credits at the end of a movie. You can set the duration of your video clips plus set the in and out points for speed of the text and scrolls.

Looking at Final Cut Express Storyboard

Storyboard gives me a visual look at my movie. I control-click the Final Cut Express browser and choose large icon new. Then, I drag the clips into the order that I want them to be played. Next, I click on the project's tab in the Browser and save it. Finally, I save the entire project.

Now to add my new storyboard to Final Cut Express 4 sequences. Draw a marquee around the Storyboard clips. Next, I drag the clips from my Final Cut Express Browser to my Timeline and save the project. To protect them, I can lock them to make sure that they cannot be modified. I can lock and unlock them with the F4 key for video tracks and the F5 key for audio tracks.

Pro Reaction

Express allows you to import iMovie projects. You can also import your Final Cut Express project to iDVD complete with special chapter marker. Express comes with an excellent hardcopy paper manual for learning how to use Final Cut Express 4. The manual is easy to follow without computer jargon.

Con Reaction

You have to work at learning how to use the Final Cut Express application. You have to spend the time to read and work with the Final Cut Express manual.

You cannot capture DV across time-code breaks. You cannot import your Final Cut Express project to iMovie or QuickTime with chapter markers and comments.

Final Remarks

Express is better than my iMovie applications and gives you professional storyboard, title and video effects."
"The Norton AntiVirus 2005 expands its work by protecting your computer from internet worms, before they get into your computer, and also defends against spyware and certain other non-virus threats including adware and keystroke logging programs.  That is a big change from 2004, providing great anti-virus protection and going outside that arena to stop other bothersome attacks.

I have used Norton AntiVirus Software for years and have never had a malicious attack without the software catching the culprit and advising of the destruction or procedure to follow.  Great software and a piece of mind to know that it is active on your compupter."
"Unbelievable CRAP! It's not even worth one star. Had to go back to Windows when my old Mac finally passed on. Thought Windows ME sucked? This is the new king of Suckedom. Freezes up CONSTANTLY, does unexplainable weird things for no reason, shuts itself off for no reason. I could go on for hours. Had me looking for the razor blades on a minute to minute basis. Thank the computer gods I was able to purchase an awesome used Mac Pro. Cannot WAIT to send this to PC hell in a million pieces. It's frightening something of this magnitude on the Crap-O-Meter is released on the public. If you use Windows, save yourself years of therapy and don't buy Vista!"
"Originally installing this the activation stated NOT GENUINE MICROSOFT.  I had to go through a set up Microsoft site and enter several six digit numbers.  Finally it was activated.  Now some months later I had an issue with the system and had to reboot it again.  Now its telling me the same thing on the activation, but this time it refused to activate.  It states that I have a counterfeit product and that Microsoft has blocked my product key number!!"
This product is a lot easier than Mcafee or Webroot. I highly recommend this product. 1. After installing the product make sure you have an online connection to perform the first live update. 2. After that has been done perform a full scan . 3. and after that perform a custom scan. so that your computer is safe.
It works Ok not great.
This version seems to be a bit more user-friendly than 8 or 9.  It still is a complex program that can do many things.  I recommend it for anyone's use.
Good program
Worked Great Thank You!
Love Turbo Tax!
Purchased Norton 360 as its less costly to purchase new software than to renew my existing software on the computer.
"I was so disappointed at the previous version I needed to purchase two years ago when I first got my Mac.  Everything transferred smoothly and I love the fact that I can sync it to my iPhone.  An automatic sync would be nice, but no big deal.  I have yet to figure out all the features, but like it so far."
"If your OS changes, forget about getting this software to work. I have used a Mac computer since 1998. Most software like this one says it will work on a Mac. It doesn't. Save your money. If I could rate it a ""0"" I would."
"I am surprised at the number of mediocre reviews for this splendid game. I loved it! I am rather amused at the ""10 years old and up"" on the cover..they had probably no idea that ""up"" in one case at least is aged 76, me- and that's really up.

The graphics are very fine. The puzzles are hard and you are obliged to play several games with the little girl in the story, Jane, in order to obtain certain tools to proceed. These games within the game did get a bit tedious, but I am was hopelessly slow at ""Petroglyph Punch"" and the like. And it took me five tries to gather up 13 ghosts milling around the manor. When something is timed I panic. I'm like my cats who vanish if I even look at the door where the vacuum cleaner is kept.

The voice acting is very good, and if the British accents aren't authentic, so what. The images of the characters are very well done, the gestures and mouth synchronization very natural. Mrs. Drake is particularly good, she's rather like a watered down version of Mrs. Danvers.

I could not have finished this game without the help of a walkthrough. The puzzles are hard. But the fact that I always cheat like mad doesn't bother me ar all and I never have felt that the game is spoiled one whit with the heavy use of a walkthrough. If you can finish this game without assistance, more power to you. But take it from an old lady- this game is fun and if you have to sweat a bit here and there, that's part of the whole adventure game enchilda."
Very easily downloaded. Now I feel secured having this product protecting my computer and valuable information
The Pages app is not compatible with new Pages documents.
great program and shipped on time
the best of the best
saved my MAC
Easy download and easy install...great price!
Good program
What a joke! This product is more about NetZero than typing. I bought this program so my daughter could practice typing and 10-key but all we got was NetZero and it does not ask your permission to put NetZero on your computer. Such a sad day for Mavis Beacon. My suggestion is try a free online tutor first. If you buy this product all I can say is good luck.
"I had Trend Micro PC cillin 2006 and was very well pleased. I was offered a free update to PC cillin 2007 back in Sept. 2006 and was leary of the product because of bad comments. In March 2007 I updated to 2007 and love it. It does the job great and I am very well pleased with its performance. Trend Micro had problems for a few months upon release of this product but now it does the job very well. Great interface,fast scanning and a great product now that all the bugs are gone. Highly Recommended and by the way I forgot one the most important details. FREE Customer Support by calling their 800 number and talking to a REAL HUMAN and its free because you bought their product. Imagine that Norton(Symantec) and so many others."
"I've used the MapSource 100k series since 2002 and purchased the 24K series when I purchased my new GPSmap 62s.  The 24K series is outstanding, well worth the investment.  I don't know if this is a 24k MapSource feature or a GPSmap 62s feature, but I wsa surprised to discover that I can plan a route to a street address by road.  I didn't expect to be able to find a street address with with 24 Topo map.  I wish I would have tried a street address before I installed the 24K series, then I'd know if it was the GPSmap 62s or the 24K MapSource that provided the capability.
The maps were great to have while hunting!"
"I've watched Quicken reviews for 2 years now and they've terrified me. I feel like there are many factors surrounding the large number of negative, mediocre, and positive comments.

The negative comments seem to be a combination of folks who have been legitimately screwed by the upgrade, people who are mad at Intuit for their lukewarm business practices, and people with a ""pile-on"" mentality.

The positive comments seem to be posted by individuals who live a charmed life filled with kittens and rainbows...oh, and unicorns. The conspiracy theorists might even say that the positive reviews are shills.

I settled in on the middle of the road.

I was genuinely afraid that the upgrade from 2012 to 2014 would ruin my day. I performed all manner of preparatory work by backing up, finding previous install media, performing last rites...anything I could think of to allow for a recovery from the impending disaster which would soon befall me.

The installation went fine.

The data migration went fine.

The program opened and functioned fine.

The registration went fine.

The data download from my accounts was ALMOST flawless. I did have to reenter one of my passwords (not sure why).

I am REALLY glad that, so far, my functionality is unbroken. Thanks Intuit!

The reason I am only giving 3 stars is that there doesn't seem to be any wow factor or compelling reason for me to have moved to the 2 year newer version. I understand that there are some mobile features and some cloud items, but this doesn't FEEL any different...or LOOK any different. Maybe for the masses that is a good thing. Heck, the Premier icon is not even any different. At least the TurboTax program updated the icon.

Look, I am not a Quicken or Intuit hater. I really like what Quicken has added to my life over the last MANY years. The chore of personal finances is much less onerous and cumbersome thanks in large part to Quicken. THANKS Intuit.

Intuit, please modify your business model with regard to Quicken (and possibly TurboTax). PLEASE consider getting OFF the ""every year major release"" merry-go-round. Go to a model where incremental releases are available across years for a more modest fee...or even free. I don't think the basic code changes completely from one year to the next. You already force users to upgrade every 3 years to get downloads (that seems smarmy, but I digress). How about a major release window of every three years? Maybe a subscription for online services that includes updates to the software? Or, something else completely. It seems obvious from reading the comments on Amazon that a great deal of people are not delighted by the status quo.

At least think about it.

Bottom line, for me, I survived Quicken 2014 day one. I hope that my luck holds out in the days to come."
"I bought this game 3 years ago for my son (now 8) and he loved it.  I didn't like the language- they say ""stupid"" quite a bit.  And I didn't like the way the characters make fun of you if you don't do well.  And I didn't like how there are movie-type scenes that they have to watch to get to the next game.  You can't skip over these.  But he loved it and it did teach him basic chess skills.  However, the game ONLY works if the CD is in the computer.  After about a year, the CD got scratched and stopped working.  Eventually, I decided to purchase LtPC 2 (see my even lower review for that!) for my son and to purchase this game again for my daughter, age 5.  She will only play 2 or 3 of the games because she finds it so upsetting the way the characters make fun of her if she doesn't do well.  My daughter is a spunky girl who has no trouble standing up for herself so it must be quite upsetting for her to not want to play the game.  I'm fed up with these games.  I work hard to teach my children to have good character, good sportsmanship and good communication skills.  I don't need that compromised by a poorly executed video game."
"Whatever this software is supposed to do, I never noticed it.  Kind of an odd brand and cheap looking packaging.  Wished I never bought it."
"I have been using System Mechanic for 10 years, and it has been pretty good.  Recently Iolo has become update-happy (it did two in quick succession today, each time finding problems that were missed earlier - or pretending to). It tells me I have 4 cores in the CPU (LiveBoost, Realtime Status) but Intel specifies that the processor has only 2 cores.  4 threads but 2 cores.  I believe Intel.  This does not enhance my confidence in System Mechanic.  If it cannot accurately detect the CPU, what else is it missing?
The System Shield malware protection evidently interferes with TrendMicro and, if the user is not careful he will hit the button to install the Iolo product, then have to uninstall System Mechanic to shut it off.  That is a waste of time.
Though I have two years remaining, Iolo has been bugging me to add time for the last two years.  Again, if the user is careless he will spend money unintentionally.
The product seems good but the company has become annoying and out of control.  When the license expires I will not renew."
"Not worth paying for this software.  It cannot download many youtube videos with https prefix.
Free versions work just as good if not better.
Truth is, not the paid or free versions can download all videos, but the advertising for this product had me believe otherwise.
I was a sucka for paying for this software, but, now helping others so they don't have to be one."
Total disaster. Does not work like its supposed to and I am unable to get a refund. I am unable to play embedded clips in powerpoints. There is no support and no automatic update of codecs. I wish I could get my money back but now I am stuck with this program which I purchased thinking that it would perform much better than any knockoff version. It is wrong that we cant get a refund for a product that does not work. I have spent hours looking for how to install codecs and how to get my Microsoft office to work. It keeps  freezing up my computer.
"This product is terrible, and so is the customer service. I thought I could save a few bucks by switching from TurboTax, but it's not worth it. For one thing, you end up paying for the state file. For another, the whole program is wonky and not nearly as easy to follow as TurboTax. Finally, trying to do an Amended Return is a nightmare. After intense googling to figure out how to do it, I was able to ""amend"" but cannot find out how to PRINT the amendment! There is no online web help for that problem -- they demand you call and talk to their Press 1 Press 2 robot, which eventually tells you there is no support available on Sundays.  UGH!! I can't say enough bad things about this product.  I would have been better off with paper."
I use TurboTax each year and this is just a continuation of the best software to complete a very complicated set of tax returns.
Great product.  I've used Norton for a long time and have always been protected and satisfied.
Great game for the pc. Got it here fast. Would recommend this game for anyone who loves challenges and puzzles.
"System wasn't very useful/encouraging and achieving good proficiency isn't very likely based on the picture system. Also keep in mind that you can't sell/transfer the discs and registration number to someone else. Use it or trash it, which I think is a disincentive to purchase this product."
This is an excellent product and I have been satisfied with its performance and the buying transaction.
Ease in working through tax requirements. Excellent questions for assistance.
"I purchased this product to protect my computer from viruses, malware, spyware, etc.  The best protection it provides is the disc acting as a coaster.  It was running and updated within the last few minutes when my computer was attacked by ""XP Internet Security"".  It looked like a Windows update screen, and it has wreaked havoc on my system.  According to the people at Norton, since I clicked on the pop up to close it, it allowed it into my computer and now 360 can't even see it.  Now ""XP Internet Security"" won't allow IE to open, I can't get to ""My Computer"" and I get constant pop ups for ""XP Internet Security"".  Norton said they can remote in to fix it for $140!!!  Are you kidding me?!?!  It missed this threat and now you want to charge me to fix it?!?!  The Geek Squad charges $200 and they'll also fix my CD and DVD drives (which stopped working about 2 weeks after installing Norton 360).  But they literally just called me as I am typing this to tell me the Hard Drive is failing a Read/Write test and they want more to fix that.  Thanks Norton you've protected me from hundreds of dollars of my own money.

A few weeks after I wrote this, it automatically updated to 360 4.0.  I have also started running Trend Micro Housecall from their website almost daily as I still don't trust Norton.  Also bought a 500GB hard drive to replace the failing one after my corporate IT guys cleaned the old drive."
"I recently began using this in conjunction with eClinicalWorks as the EMR, and find Dragon to be very good. I am used to dictating quickly to a transcription line, and I do have to slow down a bit and speak clearly. Dragon recognizes almost any medical term accurately, and even recognizes common proper names (e.g., patient's first names, like 'Cecilia' or 'Anna') and that surprised me a bit.

There are lots of tips included indicating how to improve accuracy; it's quite accurate already even before i have begun to use some of the extra activities suggested. I am happy and impressed with Dragon and don't see any limitations to it. I use it for a general adult medicine practice, apparently it can be customized for specialty practices, but I can't speak to that.

Recommended without hesitation."
"I can see where windows 8 would be a great OS for tablets, but I just don't think it's my cup of tea for a desktop.  I use dual monitors, and I play full screen video games, so of course my needs may be slightly different than others.  I also use skype, and I really just don't like the skype client and how it takes up the full screen, also as the messenger screen does.  I also don't like how even when I close the messenger app I still get notifications.  I actually had to totally disable it.  I'd just use Trillian, but it's not really updated to run Skype on windows 8 so there goes that.  Yeah, this is all pretty user specific complaints, so admittedly if you have different uses for your desktop it might not be so bad."
"Product installed fine but watch the newer automatic features that may not always be good. The ""sonar scan"" quarantined several *.exe files that were needed to run some important programs on this machine. Also the ""clean-up"" erases temp files which in rare cases may be needed. I still help others remove viruses from their computers each week with either Norton or McAfee already installed. Makes we wonder....."
"For $69.00 I bought the Sun StarOffice8 suite of programs. You get Word Processing, Speadsheets, Presentation, Database, and Drawing and Graphics programs. You also get the Mozilla Firefox Web Browser and Mozilla Thunderbird Email service. They also send you verions of Office8 for Linux, two Sun operating systems, as well as the Window version, and even a small manual. I find the on screen Help Menus to be much more helpful and useful than those in MS. It's also nice not getting charged extra for certain programs as you do with the the MS suite. It's also compatible with MS Word Excel, etc., so you can send and receive documents to people with the MS suite. More people should check it out."
"I needed copies of a dvd and ordered this software because it was inexpensive. I figured that it might not do what I had in mind and didn't want to spend a lot of money. Well, when it arrived, I installed it and quickly made a copy of the dvd. Tried it in my dvd player and it worked perfectly! It did what I wanted it to do and was able to make several copies in a few minutes. All turned out ok. I'm pleased."
excellent for learning to begin to sweep.
"I love Amazon Music!!!! I stream at home and in the car with the iPhone app. Easy to use and the sound quality is better than other apps I've heard.
Having invested a fair amount of cash in a car system for Rock and Blues Music ( no Boom Boom music) the Amazon Music app sounds great!!!! And most any song I can come up with I generally find it."
"MS Outlook has been invaluable for emailing, calendar, reminders etc. for quite some time. Outlook 2007 tried to add more features and functionality but unless you upgrade to Word 2007 as commented by other reviewers you lose some of the word processing features.

Also, it may be just me but my computer has started running slower since I installed this version of Outlook."
Really like it!
I almost didn't buy this based on several of the negative reviews but I'm glad i did. I have just converted all my childhood 8mm movies to digital and being over 50 years old they needed a lot of help. The levels function combined with the color correction do a great job of making the clips usable. This may not be software for the professional but I'm impressed with it's capability for people like myself.
"It took me several hours to learn how to use this software,  easy to learn. I edited three video sequences, combined them into one, added various music and captions to my video along with a watermark, and uploaded to youtube. I did this on a Dell D820 laptop running XP.  Don't tease me about the old machine,  it works great and so does this software- which is well worth the money."
I can't get it to load onto my hard drive
"To take from the ""For Dummies"" book (FYI: I recommend you get, or at least read it if you're new to art programs),

""There are a lot of programs for making art, but few for actually making comics.""

Manga Studio fills that void and does a great job doing it.  I'm not well practiced with it yet, but I like what I've been pulling together in the time I've worked with it.  This is an ideal choice for would be comic makers."
"This is poorly designed and poorly tested software.  Really common and basic capabilities like file-->open for editing exising labels don't exist or work sensibly, on installation all dates on jpg files are changed (modified date)to the date the software is installed, slide shows don't rebuild without fiddling around with the audio files, check boxes for audio don't activate when displayed, sound tracks on DVD slide shows skip and don't sync when new pictures are added to a show. Ignore the professional reviewers, this is awful.

However, if you like puzzles, Media Creator is for you. Roxio didn't have a concept of how people use computers with version 5.0, it's gone downhill from there."
"Works well, but in Word, some of my documents do not show the curser at all. This is very annoying and makes editing difficult."
"I've been succeassfully using Quicken for over 10 years and want to upgrade to 2008, but the online banking function recently scared me.  I use online banking and bill-pay all the time without problems.  Recently my grown daughter used my laptop to access her own separate savings account in another institution.  Her account was not listed in my Quicken accounts, and she has never used Quicken.  After she logged off I opened Quicken to do some banking and was shocked to see my daughter's savings account integrated into my accounts and included in my assets!  There was even a full register generated .showing all of her transactions!  This was quite a surprise.  Her bank account is in Italy (on a US Naval base) and mine are in a different bank in California.  I tried to delete her account from Quicken but couldn't.  I called Quicken customer service which is headquartered in New Delhi, India, and spoke to a young woman capable of only broken English.  She fixed the problem, thankfully, but charged me $[...] to do it!  I had to provide proof of identity to this person, including name, address, SS#, etc.  Outrageous!  I'm a subscriber of [...] and recommend this service to anyone fearful of identity theft or using online banking and bill-pay.  I'll still buy Quicken 2008 . . . but not without taking precautions."
Does not protect IOS devices as advertised - only acts to backup your phone data. But good for computer protection.
Have been using this software for years.  This year seems to be even easier to use.  The help aids are very good and easy to understand.
right price
I tried twice and it didn't work.
"I was a little worried to use turbo tax this year after reading so many negative reviews. However, for me it once again proved to be everything I needed to get the job done. I will continue to use this product."
There is nothing that will make doing taxes fun. I've used H&R Block S/W for years and never had an issue.
"I've been using Family Tree Maker for years and have come to depend on it for storing thousands of records of ancestors.  The only thing I haven't liked about it is that it doesn't have enough flexibility for publishing a book, so I have to retype everything if I want to publish something.  I've used Family Tree Maker 9 for a while and bought the upgrade to Family Tree Maker 2005.  When I installed this new version I kept getting errors using my file from the old version.  The support center couldn't or wouldn't help;  I called repeatedly and they just said my file had been corrupted.  So my review is not for Family Tree Maker in general, just for this new version."
This is a great item....
I received this product because my magix movie pro wasn't cutting it for some programs. I give it 4 stars because it's a lot you have to do to get this up and running. YOU MUST DOWNLOAD DIRECTX TO HAVE THIS FUNCTION RIGHT!!.
"Every year, for $15 what else do you need, not turbo tax, its overpriced."
"I set out to learn flamingo but after working with Guitar For Dummies it soon became clear I had a ways to go.  I have certainly found this helpful in learning chords and some strumming and have enjoyed using this program.  It's easy to use and if you have as little knowledge as I do about guitar (other than having spent a great deal at a swap meet on a beautiful instrument the musician selling it said is specifically designed for flamingo) you will get a lot out of this.  I am deducting one star because Guitar For Dummies doesn't get into the style and fiery passion of flamingo and I found that disappointing.  However, I can see now that a basic foundation is almost essential and it's going to take me while before I can master the true art form that is flamingo guitar.  I can't help buy feel I was misled a bit at the swap meet because when I bought both this program and the guitar I was assured this is all I would really need.  That is in no way the fault of the Guitar For Dummies program and has more to do with my own impatience to fulfill my dream.  I do feel that I am making progress."
I have not experienced any issues while using WEBROOT. Excellent Quality software.....Would highly recommend it to everyone that owns electronic devices.
"So much cheaper than purchasing Family pack from Apple. I bought it 4 weeks before my (old .Mac) .me account expires. Entered in the updated serial numbers and on the day my acct is due to expire I'm paid again for another year. Sure beats the $17.95 I kept paying for earthlink services for 10 years.
it works great w/ all 3 of our Macs for backups, storing software, bookmarks etc.

For over the last 3 years we've been very satisfied with .Mac or .me accounts. Only one time did we regret having the service - Apple's transition to the mobileme world, why??? iPhone mania I guess."
"ZoneAlarm says that it will work with Windows ME, but it also says that it is optimized for Windoes XP. I have Windows ME, and installed Zone Alarm. My computer was running very slowly with some applications not functioning as intended. I ended up uninstalling ZoneAlarm."
"CANNOT GET SOFTWARE TO ACTIVATE.  Had the same problem before with Kaspersky software. Will not happen a third time.
Why can they not send an activation code that works?  I am currently in the LOOONNNNGGGG process of trying to get a good activation code. We will see how that turns out.  Believe me, There will not be a third time.
NP"
I have used webroot for years and have not had problem with my computer since.  Love it !!!!!!
"Previous versions worked flawlessly on my iMac running with Parallels so it will work with Windows 8. 2014 version tries to open up, but flashes various parts of black or grey screen until the computer locks up. Only way to stop the flashing of various screen patterns is to click on left side of screen until a Quicken image appears and then click on an account until all the flashing and jumping around simmers down and stabilizes.

Never had a bad experience with Quicken and have used the latest version available for over 20 years."
"My little pony is one of my little cousins favorite cd rom games, the love mostly dressing up the pony and baking the cake. Their least favorite part of it is searching for the items the little pony friends ask for. When they go to do the choreography session for the party , my cousins say she does the same dance moves. the are right they all look the same most of the time. When they go to dress the pony, they just love seeing the different hairstyles, some lookes so funny they would laugh at it. when they start baking the cake, they complain about not too much color to choose from. However the most annoying part of playing the cd rom game was the non-stoppable repetitive sentences the ponies kept using while the kids were playing. Their favorite part was entering the castle.. they'd start applauding, smiling and jumping up and down their seats because they reached the castle. You should see those kids' faces happy they accomplished their task. seeing those happy faces was indeed a pleasure"
"A great program with excellent customer support! There is a ton of functionality with this program and once you ""experiment"" with it, you will become very proficient at inputting recipes. When done correctly, the recipes are displayed in a professional format that can be easliy printed and/or emailed. The application has a large, built-in dictionary of terms ""ex. cups, tablespoons, all-purpose flour, lemon juice, etc.) that eliminates alot of manual typing. I particularily like the ability to import a reciepe posted on the web and the ability to import reciepes I scanned to non-PDF file formats. While Cook'n doesn't yet have the ability import PDF files, that problem was easily solved by purchasing an inexpensive program that converts PDF files to various Cook'n compatible formats. However, folks at the Cook'n user support help desk have told me that they are working on enabling this PDF import functionality."
"This was a horrible hassle.  The minute I installed it, everything kept freezing up.  I switched back to Trend Micro."
This a great product it is faster and  loads quicker  than older versions if you have a computer with enough power. I have put this on many peoples computers that I have built and it does a great job and the only thing that will work well for business. This is the number one financial program out there.
"The product does not seem to function properly. The manual indicates that you can change your settings so that you will not need to repeatedly enter your ID and serial number, but this function does not seem to work properly. I was in touch with customer support several times and they are extremely nice, but none of them were able to resolve the many problems I encountered. Unfortunately, they were unwilling to offer a refund, too, so I would hesitate to recommend this product to others."
"I own a Mac, and I was required to install Windows 8 (via Bootcamp) for a job. I had heard a lot of negative things about Windows 8, but I figured there was no way it could be as bad as I'd been hearing. I already own a Windows phone, and I'm pretty tech savvy, so a little learning curve would probably solve everything, right? Wrong. This is the least intuitive operating system I have ever used, and I don't think any learning curve can fix it -- it's like the learning curve on this thing goes straight up at a 90 degree angle, and if you do manage to scale the wall, you're met with a pressure plate trap that shoves you off the edge.

The apps are mostly useless -- the Skype app is so terrible that I had to download the actual Skype program to replace it (yes, apps and programs are two separate things; and yes, you can have a Skype app and Skype program which both function differently). It's like they were trying to be a Mac and Windows Phone's lovechild, but failed on all fronts.

Don't get this operating system unless you absolutely have to due to your job or being threatened at gunpoint."
"It is not stable on Vista.  Word often shuts down.  Plus you can no longer do ""save as"" from Word.  That adds a few more keystrokes for certain duplicative type of Word products."
"My rating reflects the fact that you can buy this elsewhere in Amazon for 1/2 the price.  At the lower price I think BitDefender 2010 Total Security is internet security software the way it should be built.

The installation asks you what type of user you are, with the choices of typical, gamer, parent, and a fourth choice I forgot. It then asks if you are a beginner, intermediate or advanced computer user. It then sets up the software based on your answers. Though advanced, I choose intermediate since I do not want to think about computers when I get home. I think the setup turned out perfect for me.

The newest version scans almost twice as fast as BitDefender 2009 and is far less resource intensive. I always thought BitDefender was efficient relative to other internet software, but 2010 has made another jump in performance. I was able to play Fallout 3, run a scan, and not notice a problem.

I like Total Security over other versions of BitDefender since it has all the features I want such as a registry optimizer and file backup. These are not available on other versions of BitDefender.

Of course, ""Does the software protect well?"" Results vary between different testers, but in general BitDefender does very well relative to others. But I work part time in IT security and I know keeping your software up to date and running scans regularly is more far more important than the type of software. Caveat, I do not use the parental controls or spam filter.

So why not five stars? I do not think there is such a thing as five star internet security software. First, all security software will have problems running on some computers. I have had Norton and TrendMicro not work on home computers, and read cases of Kapursky, and McAfee not running on other computers. I am sure BitDefender 2010 will have problems on some computers. Second none give great technical support. I have a four year computer science degree and I struggle to understand all security software technical support.

The main advice I tell people is go to an internet security site and try an evaluation copy. If it works and you like it, then buy a copy from Amazon where it will be cheaper. You can usually just plug the registration key in the software package into your evaluation copy. I have tried recent copies of McAfee, Norton, Kapursky, McAfee, TrendMicro and Avast. But with great software with a price for two years what others charge for one year (except Avast), I think you should start with BitDefender. BitDefender 2010 Total Security is internet security software the way it should be built.

The installation asks you what type of user you are, with the choices of typical, gamer, parent, and a fourth choice I forgot.

works good and barely slows things down. i do not like the verbal updates which override stuff I am doing so that is why 4 out of 5
"This purchase is an upgrade, but I highly recommend quick books.  It is very user friendly from other accounting software I have tried.  I have been using it for about 10 years.  I never had any formal accounting training, this program interviews you and helps you chose based upon your individual business.  I do all my own quarterlies and payroll now.  Buying it through amazon saved me about $100.00"
It was easy to install and set up.  It has good features and works quickly.  I only wish the instructions better explained how the virtual machine interacts with the base machine and it's effect on devices like drives.  I had difficulty knowing when to plug an external drive into the MAC or the Virtual machine and what the effects would be.  I figured it out through experimentation.
"I just finished using this software this past weekend to transfer all of the stuff from my old computer to the new and it worked great. I'm baffled at the problems that the other reviewers had with it. I had no trouble with it at all, very simple to use, on screen step by step instructions.  Like the other reviewers, I found that the time involved was way off from what the instructions said, but I can only assume that, that is because the makers of the software have no idea how much and what kind of data we each have in our computers, so the time is just a very rough estimate on transfering standard data. I store tons of pictures in mine so I assumed that is one reasons it took so long, about 12 hours.  I just let it do it's thing while I did other things, even went to bed and it was done when I got up, and my new computer looked just like my old one, right down to the wallpaper I had on my old computers desktop.  My old computer runs on Windows 98, new one on Windows XP Professional,and I used the printer port with the cable that came with the software.  It transfered all of my sounds, Office 2000, Quicken, with all my banking information, all of my pictures, casino games, pinball games, everything.  I was very please with this software and am glad I bought it, it did all of the work for me. I would definately recommend it."
"As others have noted, you now have to buy the more expensive Investments & Rental Property version if you have any stock, etc income.  Bad move by TurboTax.  My CD was defective in that it would not run on my Win7 Samsung laptop.  Nothing wrong with my PC since my last year TurboTax still can run and install.  I had to pull out my external CD/DVD RW Samsung portable drive on which it thankfully would run.  I was fearing I would have to return it and loose time I need to prepare my taxes.  For these reasons, I give it 3 starts.  Otherwise, it is the same TurboTax and walks you through the process easily."
Lots of potential but a steep learning curve and you need to purchase add-ons to maximize use. I got a coupons for add-ons with it.
I'm going to be building a house in CO next year and used this to layout and plan in great detail that house. It will go straight to the architect to draft the blueprints. Easy to use and exceptionally capable.
Thought this was more cold friendly but I'd say 12 plus. Games aren't fun for 10 year old.
"There's not a lot in the box.  It's a single hardcover book and a card with access to an online website where you do most of the activities.  It's possible to use this program using an app on your tablet/phone, although using it on a phone is probably a bad idea because of the small screen size.  I think it should be possible to use a computer to access this program, but it doesn't seem to work very well.

Once you get online, it plays a bit like a video game, with very simple animations. The games start out very simple (identifying letters) and eventually progress in difficulty (actual reading activities).  It's made by Rosetta Stone, and if language experts can't be trusted to teach reading, well....

Ultimately, what holds me back from a 5-star rating is:
- This is a subscription-based service, not software that you can own forever like my other Rosetta Stone products. There is no CD in the box, only an online code.  Nowhere on the product is it made particularly obvious that this is a subscription-based product
- While you can access the program using an app, you cannot use the app to register for the service - for that you need a full-feature browser.
- Characters in the software seem to have exactly three positive responses and three negative responses.  That is nowhere near enough for Daddy, who feels the need to throw his tablet out the window every time he hears ""Uh-huh"".
- Wifi is a must, so we can't use this in our car or on trips.  It does not work offline.
- There is a really annoying video that pops up every single time you log into the website that you can't really skip over.  It's a small thing, I know, but the video is a good 20 seconds long and isn't even being used as a way to cover up loading the next screen or anything.

Many of these are small annoyances.  I think that with fewer of them, this is a 5-star product, but it has some growing to do first."
"I previously used Quicken 2007 for Mac and with the impending release of Lion for the Mac, I needed to find a new personal finance solution or upgrade to Quicken Essentials for Mac.  After trying various other solutions, I decided to go ahead and upgrade to QEM as there were little things that bothered me about the other solutions I tried.  Am I frustrated that QEM only offers a subset of the functionality that Quicken 2007 has?  Yes.  But it's not fair to dis this product for that reason.  Intuit was very upfront with what this version supports and the differences between 2007 and this version.  So for what this product says it does, then I have to say it actually does it pretty well.  However, I did encounter an issue with the product and support was of no use.

I decided to start with a new file, so I can't comment on the import capability, but it does exist.  I was able to quickly setup my bank accounts and transactions downloaded without any issue.  I wasn't able to directly connect to my investment accounts.  While this version has very limited abilities when it comes to investment accounts, I was hoping it would at least grab the overall portfolio value and update that, but it does not.  I have to go to my investment accounts, export a file and then import that into QEM.

There are a few other quirks that bug me and a few features that I miss.  There is no implied decimal anymore, so I have to enter that.  I don't like the way the categories are displayed.  I liked the old drop down box behavior over this big window that pops up with all the categories and they filter down as you type away.  When I create a new transaction, the date field is selected and specifically the month is selected.  I hit the TAB key to move to the date field, but I guess I do it to quickly, as the day field highlights but then it quickly goes back to the month being selected.  Very annoying.  Also don't like the fact that dates have to be entered as 7/20/2011 rather than 7-20-2011.  I do like the way I can reconcile my statements and it seems to be much quicker for me now versus in 2007.

After using the product for about two months, I was all of a sudden no longer able to download transactions from my bank anymore.  I searched online with the error message that was reported and tried the steps that were suggested to no avail.  I opened up a support case and they quickly responded with the same steps I found earlier.  After telling them that those steps did not resolve the issue, they told me that it's likely an issue with their servers and that they would escalate the issue.  I waited several days with no response.  I then sent a follow-up email asking for an update and that went unanswered as well.  Another few days go by and I sent another request for an update.  And again, I get no response.  Now I've gone over a week with no ability to update.  At this point, I troubleshoot further by creating a new file and resetting up my accounts.  Surprisingly, it worked!  So this told me there was something wrong in my original file, but unable to get any response from support, I was forced to start all over again with a new file.  I'm hoping this doesn't happen again.

In the end, I give the product 4 stars for what it does.  I would give their support 1 star.  If the problem I had appears again, then my rating on the product would definitely go down.  I'm still hoping they release a new version that brings back all the missing features from 2007, but at this point, I'm not holding my breath."
"Pretty sure that this is a virus.  The name of the process is completely not related to Amazon.  I downloaded from this yesterday, it disappeared overnight, and am currently running ,my virus scanner to make sure that it is not hiding malware on my computer.  Download from the actual amazon approved link. Do not use this suspect entry."
Best price for recognized product.
Too much of a learning curve for me.
"Quicken H&B is good for the money BUT save your cash for the Rental portion. Does not integrate well with the Business side .I do almost all with the Business portion . If heavy duty is what you wish, use Quick Books. U-Tube videos as to how to set up  rentals aplenty. Disappointed with the package as a whole , pleased with the H&B . Saving grace is the Quicken Community. I was able to make it work for me with plenty of tweaking and time ."
"CorelDraw is a great piece of software which I use often.  The learning curve is relatively low and the integration of the programs in the suite is great.  CorelDraw users are really dedicated to the software and I'm one of them.  I've been using it for many generations of the product.

Once you learn it, you likely will become a fan of the product as I've become over the years."
"The interface looks great and it works when you're actually making the slide show. Unfortunately saving movie in any format failed (leading to unexpected results). Totally useless for me then, and a big waste of time. I used only one large photo (20k pixels wide, Mac based), so maybe that's why there were issues. Customer support nearly non-existent, so I couldn't make them to fix the problem or even discuss it, so I've returned the software."
"I suppose it is unfair to give this a one star for not working on Vista, as it does not claim to.  This program is 16 bit, which means even on Windows XP it has to use the NTVDM.exe (the virtual machine) and that can cause problems and the video will never be great.

Not everyone will have problems but watch out."
"I own & operate an indoor/outdoor movie company and purchased this program to play background music AND movies right from my laptop to keep things simple.  Combined with a new Blu-Ray optical drive on my Dell Inspiron N5050 with Windows 7 & 4gb RAM, I do not experience any playback issues.  The program works well.

Point deducted because I do not like the way the menu is laid out, but it does the job and has all the features I need.  And the price was right.  Program was easy to install."
"I actually got the previous version at another place, best buy. It was more money than amazon. For me, on a one year old windows 8 machine, nothing but problems. The main problem is when using the internet. There will be a delay of about 30 seconds before it finally loads the  page. this happens enough to be a real nuisance and costs me about 30-60 minutes a day. some days are worse than others. i have contacted webroot support and they wanted me to give them access to my machine and i declined. just too much sensitive info on it and who knows where it ends up going right? while waiting it says in the lower left info browser window something like ""waiting for extension waiting for webroot extension"".. I am over it and looking for a namebrand like I used to have, probably Norton. Never had an issue with that it was just that best buy talked me into the webroot when I bought my computer. Not recommended by me for sure and btw, I am not new to this. Have owned maybe 15 computers since 1998."
"Fast download(Ish)
Products work great on my Mac.
Use it regularly for college.

If you need it, you need it. Just but it before its too late and Microsoft completely changes to 365 and you have to pay an annual fee. F THAT."
"After buying a new laptop earlier this year with pre-loaded Vista, I was eagerly awaiting Windows 7 to debut because it was supposed to improve the speed of my computer and reduce the crashing.  I upgraded to Windows 7 Professional 32-bit yesterday (which took 5 hours) and I have seen no improvement to the sluggishness of my relatively new laptop.  Furthermore, during my first day of use my browser has locked up twice, Excel locked up once and Outlook once (I've lost about 30 minutes of work).  So I'm no better off than with Vista.  In my house we also have an older PC that runs XP.  I've decided we'll keep it there for as long as we can (my wife and kids want me to buy a Mac, which is looking more likely every day)."
I have used this software at each upgrade for many years.  It is easy to use and have made many projects and productions on DVD of my photography shoots.
"This Sony video software is great, and I thank the seller for having the great price on it.  It's a learning experience, but easy to pick up on things like green screen, and the countless other editing options."
So far so good...
"I have  Dell with Vista 32 and found Windows 7 easy to install.  It seems to have eliminated various ""quirks"" which apparently were caused by Vista like printer issues or Outlook problems."
"Ok. I wanted to learn about these techniques because frankly, mind control fascinates (and scares) me. But this book is just HORRIBLE. It is loaded with cryptic, needlessly esoteric psychobabble and complex metaphors as well as thousands of random historical facts about MI6, the CIA, the FBI, Joseph Mengele, African tribesmen, etc all strung together randomly and using no particular time line. He jumps around so much that you wonder if he himself has multiple personalities or wrote this entire book stream-of-consciousness. I am being completely serious! In the very beginning of the book, he defines several mind control terms that will be used throughout each chapter (such as ""alter""), but this really does not help the reader along much because the problem is his writing style, which consists mainly of run-on sentences and extremely long-winded paragraphs that make no cognitive sense initially. This book was CLEARLY not edited by a professional. At times it is so densely packed with information that you literally have to read a single sentence 6 or 7 times to infer its meaning. Below is an example of what I am talking about. This is only a PORTION of a single paragraph (not the entire paragraph, which goes on for almost an entire page without a break):

""In Illuminati systems these early parts are dehumanized into thinking
they are gems and crystals. These gems and crystals then ""power"" the
entire mind-control system that is programmed over the following years
into the child's mind. The gems are not perceived as alters, so the proxy
core wouldn't integrate with what is perceived as an inanimate object.
The proxy core is allowed to want to move toward health with a therapist,
it is programmed to move toward healing, but to lead the therapist away
from the true core. She or he is programmed to believe it is the true
core. The real core & its first splits, which are the gems, are placed
hypnotically at the mind's deepest levels--in an area of the mind few
therapists ever search.""

How could anyone possibly understand this without some kind of ""decoder ring""? This is actually one of the more *simplistic* sections of the book! The whole thing reads like a technical manual. I just don't see the point of being so cryptic if your purpose is to educate people. I honestly don't think I would recommend this book to anyone. Ever."
Works great
"If Linux is what you want then go with the oldest distribution around.  Slackware has been with us for 10 years and keeps getting better with every release.  These are not 4 or 5 times a year like the other distros!
Although install is still text it is very easy to follow and getting a system up and running is a matter of minutes.  Most everything (if not all) is recognized by the setup program so on startup all is well.
On first login you won't have a graphical login.  But that is easy to remedy.  Just put a line into the /etc/rc.d/rc.local file that goes like this:
/opt/kde/bin/kdm (if you chose KDM as your window manager)
or use
/usr/bin/gdm (if you chose GNOME as your window manager)
or /usr/bin/X11/xdm if you did not install KDE or GNOME.
and if you don't want to do any of the above, log in and type
startx
and the GUI will start up.
I've used this distro for close to 10 years along with FreeBSD.  It is not bloated, it is fast, and there is lot of help on forums and search engines if you run into trouble.  Highly recomend it.  And if you like it, support Slackware, get a subscription."
"I like Final Draft because it automatically helps me write/format my scripts well.  I am impressed with the improved navigation, look, and feel. Overall, the entire user experience has been improved.  This does take some adjustment to get use to from 8. This is a good product for anyone aspiring, learning, or industry wide and is the go-to solution to keep up with the Joneses!"
Works well; Everything as promised.

"Kindle is a great tool. Ergonomic, easy and instinctive. Initially, I did not want to go away from paper, but Kindle changed my mind. It is easy, I can carry all my books, my whole library!, on my computer or my cellphone or my Kindle reader, it is fun and easy to read where ever I am. And the most important, it is comfortable to read with Kindle tools, just like reading on paper."

"Even though this is the Federal + State + eFile version, you still have to pay an additional $19.95 to eFile your state Taxes. Keep in mind you have the option to print and mail it. Only the Federal eFile is included in the purchase price. This upset me, but since I bought the software for 50% off at $21.99, it wasn't that huge of a deal. It was still a huge shock to have to pay if I want to eFile the state; I should have researched prior to purchase. The software works great, runs smoothly, and was worth the money."
"I paid $59.99 for this and by the time I realized that it was ""discontinued"" I had already opened it and so couldn't return it. An inquiry to the manufacturer about upgrading  to the current release brought the following sad response. I got suckered on this. In the future I will be more careful to read the fine print.

""Please advise the cost of upgrading my version 1 Printshop to version 2.

They responded:

Your cost will be $ 39.95 plus $ 5.95 fee for shipping and handling.

"I loved Calendar Creator and have used it for years.  The new upgrade to Calendar Creator 12 has been such a disappointment.  Again now my yearly calendar will not show and when I add an event it just hangs up.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled and still will not work.  The great features on the old version are not on this one and such a hassle to even get it to look correct.  They need to really take a look at what they created, did they even test it.  Such a waste.  Searching for a new program now."
"So sorry was very disappointed ! Over the years Nero was the only software I used couldn't wait for the the next version. MY MAIN COMPLAINT : NO SUPPORT FROM COMPANY ?  Tried for almost a week issue was uninstall / reinstall , I even tried registry edit with the tool they finally sent it was still no go. Things change over time life's to short to be frustrated.  SO ......I found  VSO-Software convert x to 5 , one issue with it which they got back to me on within 2 days problem solved !  annelise@vsosoftware.fr  Then I got a follow up message later on from them asking if there was anything else they could do. So give them a spin Think you'll be very happy with the way it works  !"
"This is the 3rd year for me  and Turbo.  Each year it gets better/easier to use and perhaps in a couple more years it will be close to perfect.  The program takes a person some time to get used too and, in my view, is best for a person with a good understanding of  tax preparation.

My main dislike is not with the software, but rather the cumbersome process one has to endure to get answers to questions, which can take 30 to 45 minutes to get through to a live person and could result in an additional charge if you have to speak to a so called ""Tax Expert"".

I would recommend the more complex programs only to those with a good understanding of taxes.  The basic program should be good for the general lay person."

"I have been using Turbo Tax since 2003, and love the product. Although it can take awhile to locate all the forms and data you need, the actual process of doing your taxes in Turbo Tax is easy. I love that it walks me through my Home Business and Rental properties. I was able to use this on my MacBook with no difficulties. I would highly recommend this for others who want to do their taxes themselves. Also the bonus option to get some of the tax return back via an Amazon gift card was great. Getting a gift card gave you 10% extra on what you put toward a giftcard. I just wish we had put a little more on a gift card because we spent it fast."

So the program has been in my family for years we have 70 in our family and I do believe we all love Quickbook products. I'm 80 years old and I'm still going strong on keeping my own books on your program and I love it at tax time. You can say no wrong when it comes to Quick Books. I was one of the very first in our town to have quickbooks keeping our books at Jensen's Blue Ribbon Processing for 33 years. I helped many people to get started on Quickbooks. Everytime I helped someone I learned even more about the program. Now that I'm retired I'm still doing our books with all our rentals. So I'm Still  hooked on QUICKBOOKS PRO.  I love it.  Thanks for making my life much easier.

"i have used QB for many years since it was first started up. However I recently had to reinstall QB 13 to my new Win 8.1 computer as well as a new laptop. I cannot get QB to open at all as it says ""QB has reached the maximum number of registered users."" Oh really? I paid $200+ for this? It was working on the old computer - which is now dead.

Emailed QB months ago and have never heard back from them. Evidently the only way is to pay up front then maybe you you get to use what you paid for. This is the kind of corporate arrogance that develops with virtual monopolies. And it's not the only time in recent years I had to deal with this kind of ""to hell with the customer"" attititude from them. Once I had to pay for the same program twice in almost a year.

I only use it for bookkeeping, as I run a one man consultancy. Dealing with these people is absolute GRIEF.

Still waiting to be able to get QB to work again."
"Last year I used TT.  I figured because my return is so basic that I would go the cheaper route and try H&R Deluxe.  I had two major problems using the software.  First, I had a difficult time figuring out how to get the Making Work Pay credit. Because I didn't do something, H&R yellow flagged an item related to form M but without clear directions how to fix it. I did figure out how to get the yellow flag warning fixed but it wasn't easy. For me that's $800.00. Second, H&R insisted on using form 8917 for a tuition deduction instead of form 8863 for the college tax credit that I deserved. Believe me it took a lot of research to figure out that I did qualify for the credit. That would have cost me $1000.00 refund.  A minor point, it also makes it a challenge if you have 3 cars and want to deduct the registration fees. It can be done but it does flag the ""other tax"" and asks for a notation on the tax form.
For grins I used Turbo Tax deluxe on line. I used bogus personal data but my real numbers. TT got the return correct, and I got an additional $1100.00 return.  H&R was cheaper but in my case it cost a bunch of extra time and possibly a lot of money in refund.
Just a note for California residents. Both programs got the same tax amounts for CA.
I did end up buying Turbo Tax. So I paid for 2 tax programs this year, but not next year!!"
Downloaded it straight from Amazon & man was it quick! Ive had to write papers & create powerpoints for my college class & its done everything & more. A friend of mine who has a PC & Microsoft Word was amazed on how different ours looked & preferred my display over hers! Excel as well has helped in creating charts that I needed for school as well. DEFINITELY worth the money :)
"I bought this product at Sam's Club and excited about the idea of making my own cookbook with my recipes.  I have spent the afternoon messing with it and am very disappointed. I found the help screen confusing.  It took me a whole hour to figure out how to import a picture into the recipe and it was not as easy as the direction indicated.

The cookbook idea is fine if you don't mind one recipe per page by alphabetical order.  To do even this one has to put the desired recipes in a ""meal plan.""  That seems illogical to me.  I was hoping to be able to organize by type of dish, but unless one labels it by the type of food first,but that won't happen unless you label each recipe something  like ""Bread - Basic Biscuits.""

It is rather easy to copy a recipe from a word document and paste it into the program to enter the recipe.  It does have some nice features in this part that made that process relatively easy once I got the hang of it.

Most of my current recipes are already in a nice word document with a font I like and indexed so I can create ""cookbook"" that one can use to find recipes by name and type.  I will not use this rather tedious program that does not do what I want it to. This software was money wasted on my part."

The product does run on my Netbook but uses most of the memory.  I can only run one application at a time which defeats the whole purpose of running Windows.

"I picked up this product as a replacement for Norton when they committed the cardinal AV sin - shutting down all antivirus services when the supbscription ended and then asking for an exorbitant re-up fee. Sadly, life isn't much better now.  There are a few key issues that you MUST be aware of:

1.  User Experience - configuration is cumbersome, complicated and incomplete (some alerts you can disable - others not, some tasks you can schedule others not).  I've been working on computers professionally since '94 and this UI is years behind the competition.

2.  Resource Usage - Since installing my system has slowed down significantly and I constantly receive connection failure errors when browsing the web - Hotmail attachments take 3 attempts to load.  And I'm running a dual core with 2 GB of RAM.

3.  Half-Baked Tools.  Its nice that McAfee wants to offer items like backup and a shredder but they need to at least try and match what real vendors in this space are using.

Net - Unless you have no other choice don't get this product.  I've stripped out all components of the product except the antivirus and my computer speed is almost back but browsing is still a pain.  I really feel like I've got a virus killing my laptop.  Today the entire thing goes and I switch to a new vendor."
"A good antivirus, seems to work  fine."

"I am an adict of this program from way back as it brings together Notes, Calendar, Contacts, ToDo lists in one file with appropriate views.  yes i need to migrate all this to more modern cloud apps and have done so with many.  but it does ease the pain of transition as it works on Windows 7 in XP mode"
This is an OK product but I probably won't utilize it much so I didn't want to take up computer space and only use it as needed
"The upgrade went very smoothly.  Drop the CD in and follow the prompts, with your Zumo connected.  It takes a long time.  I wasn't timing it but I think it was well over an hour.  I think that's just an artifact of the Garmin containing full maps of the U.S...  which is one of the nice things about the Garmin, i.e. not having to load different map modules if you are traveling over a wide range of states.  My only dissatisfaction was that for an upgrade, I thought it a bit pricey, but the maps were very complete.  It contained maps of areas that were relatively new and not on the previous release I had.  Good product though pricey."
"I have been using this Garden Organizer Deluxe for almost a decade.  My only regret is that it doesn't run on my Mac.  To give you an idea of how much I value Garden Organizer, I bought a copy of VMware Fusion for no other reason than to enable me to run Garden Organizer in a PC window on my Mac.  What I like most is that I can completely customize it for my garden plants.  I have kept track of hundreds of species over the years, entering all the data that I want to track in categories that I have specified myself.

For example, my categories include the date when I bought the plant, the seller from whom I bought it, how it is responding to various treatments as well as the social and botanical notes like the medicinal uses of the plant or other interesting characteristics.  Many plants don't do very well in the crazy climate of Miami where I live.  I keep track of which ones cannot tolerate our humid summers or dry winters so that I don't buy them again.  I'm also interested in the family connections--the place of each plant in the botanical world--so I have ""Family"", ""Genus"" and ""species"" as three of my categories. And I have lots of photography--my own--of flowers, leaves and fruit for each plant.

The last thing I want in my garden plant organizer is a data base of thousands of plants that I don't own.  If I want to know how to lay out a garden, or look up characteristics of common garden plants, or learn how to prune a shrub I'll buy a CD Rom.  I'll bet that most of the weird plants in my garden are not even represented in most gardening data bases."

"I could not register this product because I have ie7 and they can't work with ie7,  I have called their support phone number (toll call) and they told me to uninstall ie7.

"This was the only product I tried, including Intellisync that worked synchronizing the IPAQ pocket PC with ACT. Easy to set up and easy to use. My only complaint is that it doesn't synchronize notes in ACT."
"I previously used the first version of this product many years ago.  After it lost all my data, I started using a spreadsheet instead.  Great decision!

I got this version almost free with a purchase of turbotax.  It's hard to believe after all these years Quicken has gotten even worse.

My recommendation - either use a spreadsheet or use Quicken's recently purchased Mint online service."
"This software for preparing United States Income and State taxes works well.  IMHO all of these tax preparation programs are overpriced but the alternative of doing 20 pages of tax forms by hand can be so daunting that ""ya just bite the bullet and get it"".  And since H & R is considerably less expensive than its Turbo Tax Counterpart and since both do the same job - H & R has been our choice for the last 3 years."
WOW!  I cannot believe that this product has gotten WORSE!  Please don't purchase this software or you will be as unhappy as I am.  It is totally unusable and there is ZERO support.  You may as well set your money on fire.
"I had used Dragon before and it worked great.  But this version is HORRIBLE.  it does not recognize half of what I am saying even after working with it for several months.  Plus it now only types text to a pop up box and not directly to the software application where you want to use it i.e. Outlook, Word, etc.  I think I am pretty computer literate so feel sure I have everything installed correctly and I went through all the set up steps.  So I also feel sure that this is a function of a bad product and not operator error.  I have just uninstalled the program and am glad it did not cost too much since it was a total waste of money."
This is a great product.  I have used it for many years.  I believe my computer is well protected with it.  I will continue to use it!

Apparently this product does not work with OSX Mountain Lion 10.8.4 and there is no update for this. I wanted to transfer VHS (of my own bands' material) to DVD. After spending 90 minutes in which it seemed to be recording beautifully (audio and video signals looked/sounded fine), it would not ""Save"". The most I could get it to save was 3 or 4 minutes at a time. And even then, playback was completely out of sync, whether I used High or Medium quality setting. Horrendous and un-usable. It is completely worthless to me. I may as well have set the $ on fire, it would have been more entertaining."

"McAfee Total Protection with Site Advisor Plus provides a lot of value to home PC users. At an affordable cost, you can protect and manage up to 3 PCs with an impressive array of preventative maintenance and network administration tools. Importantly, you gain the peace of mind knowing that the software you are using is from McAfee, who for years has been recognized as a leader in security software solutions for business.

There are 12 main components to the product. These include software to help stop viruses, hackers, spyware and junk email. System administration tools include maintenance, file backup and restoration as well as tools for network configuration, file sharing and printing. Using an Internet connection, the software is continuously refreshed with updates so that you are protected from the latest threats.

I especially like the Site Advisor Plus feature which allows you to add a button to your browser's toolbar. When visiting a website, you can easily obtain a detailed status report of the site. The report includes an analysis of download tests for adware, spyware and other potential troublesome software; the number of emails you might expect to receive per month if you opt-in to a mail list; annoyances such as excessive use of popups; a schematic displaying the online affiliations of the site; and reviewer comments about the site. This nifty tool is immensely valuable when visiting a website for the first time and deciding how you might want to interact with the site, if at all.

The installation process was easy using a PC running MS Vista. I have since used McAfee to automate the process of backing up files to an external drive; the security updates are downloading automatically; and I frequently tuen to the Site Advisor tool for insight. In my opinion, the availability of these essential services in an easy-to-use package can save any home computer user the time and hassle of system maintenance, and consequently improve the home PC ownership experience.

I highly recommend this essential product to everyone."

"This program won't do what the PC version did ten years ago, and what it does try to do it does so badly that I could not recommend it to anyone, for any purpose.  Snap tools have minds of their own, help files (what there are of them) and ""support"" are exercises in idiocy. Want to move a wall off of a corner? You are in big trouble, because chances are good you'll pull your entire house down (""...once joined, let no man pull asunder!""). Sadly, even the PC program has regressed as its price has increased, and none of the versions even now accommodates more than three floors, so don't contemplate planing renovations to a three story townhouse with a basement -- unless you think you can work with cutting a floor horizontally in two with an extra floor floating in space. I could go on, and on. But I won't because i've already wasted too much time and money on this.

Run away. Fast."
"If you own a G4 MAC do not buy this software!  It runs very, very slowly and if you leave any Office application open it will slow down all functions on your computer.  Apparently only good if you have the new intel MAC not designed to work on the older MACs.  Getting information from Microsoft is impossible and MACTOPIA.COM was of no help.  They apparently do not even recognize the problem. Use Open Office which is free.  It too will be slow but not as slow as the Microsoft product."

"I switched from Windows to the Mac.  One of the things I was hoping to do was to switch my Quicken data to this Mac application.  It took a lot of doing and after I had finished it did not seem to be worth the effort.  The interface was really different.  One glitch I noticed was that my loan payments were not being computed correctly.  I also could not copy transactions.  There were numerous other minor glitches.  However, I decided to be patient, and I gave myself several months to get used to the new software.  I finally gave up and purchased the 2011 version of Quicken for Windows.  I run it on the Windows partition of my iMac.  I should have read the reviews of the Mac version of Quicken more closely.  If you are doing your finances in the Windows version of Quicken, do NOT switch to this Mac version.  Stick with the Windows version of Quicken."
I ordered this but the thing won't load. It keeps saying it had an error and will fix itself but it just keeps going back and forth. Trying to connect with customer service has been a joke. I say don't waste your time and money with this purchase!

"Vendor was great [5 Star], received FCE in one day.  Having just switch from PC editing to MAC, here is my opinion of FCE:  FCE is ok and would probably be great for most home photo and video enthusiast. Editing itself is good and has a fair to good amount of in application transitions, effects and editing abilities. For home slideshows and video editing it should work great.  I have a P/T professional business doing Photography and Videography.  My main problem is video; I have a prosumer Canon handheld and Panasonic professional video cameras, both format in MTS HD which FCE does not have the codec's. This means another step in processing.  First I tried what was suggested using imovie to create then load into FCE. I still had to convert the MTS to another format.  I bought a third party program to convert the MTS HD into another HD MPG4 or apple format. Very cumbersome and time consuming with having to convert and then the fact that FCE has to render before editing.  I also had to re-load several times to even get my video to load correctly [this is possible my inexperience with FCE].  I'm not use to rendering before authoring.  Still have problems in FCE accepting all of the clips.  Took my MAC book Pro to apple on a One-to-One and went over difficulties I'm having.  The tech was very helpful, but application would still be too cumbersome and to time consuming for keeping production costs within a practical budget.  I have ending up ordering FC Suite which is suppose to have the codec's in the application and not limited in all other areas.  I have been using Adobe and other PC based Editing software.  Everyone I know in the professional world had told me to get FC Suite.  I thought FCE would be like a ""FC-Pro lite"" and I could then see how FC Suite works. Unfortunately, FCE hasn't been updated in years and isn't like the newer FC Suite."
Fantastic price for the upgrade we will all need. I would highly recomend this product for PC users. More than enough new features to make you happy.
"My 15 year old daughter needed to learn typing, so I looked at MANY different programs and read the reviews. The reviews for this software (TypingMaster) appealed to me, and I decided to give it a try. The final conclusion: Our whole family LOVES it! This program is very easy to use and it's fun - in a straightforward, no nonsense, engaging way - and the learning curve is fast. I highly recommend that you try this version first!

"Norton works and works well across all of my devices.  I have had no issues, and fortunately it has not had to stop any malware.  Speed and resource-wise, the system impact is not noticeable to me.  To be fair, I am running a hexacore/12 thread Core i7-5820K with a M.2 SSD and 16GB DDR4 RAM."

"I've had a few problems with this latest addition. And you can call for assistance but the people I've spoken to haven't had a clue. They're sorta tried to help but they don't understand. In one section the program will prompt you for a yes or no answer, when the answer is neither, but it's an odd and probably rare circumstance. It works but I would suggest if you use this to print your taxes out and have them checked over by a professional IF your taxes are like mine, complex. If your taxes are really simple, well, then you don't need a program like this anyway."
"Been using Quicken for 15 years. Update every 4 to 5 years. Very pleased with program, does everything I expect and need."
"Office suite meets my needs very well.  I have only used the spreadsheet, and I don't do anything very complicated.  Primarily, I use the ""sum"", ""if"", ""or"", and occasionally, some of the other less sophisticated functions.  Especially for the price, I am very pleased with Office Suites."
I converted from PC to Mac last year. I had used FileMaker on the PC for years. The switch to Bento 2 was great. The ease of installation and use and the features the program offers did not disappoint.

"Inexpensive doesn't mean cheap when it comes to VideoStudio X4. You get the professional tools to make great videos that people will never guess was made on a product  costing under $100. Whether you are using an iPhone, DSLR camera or a pocket video recorder you're covered from start to finish"
Questions sometimes not fully detailed or explained.
Best map program ever and have used it for business and personal usage for 17 years.
"This version of windows works better on a touch screen laptop, tablet or all in one touch screen desktop.  It also works on a regular desktop computer but it could be frustrating at first.  I installed it on my all in one touch screen and its great I enjoy it."
"This game really makes you think. It is a bit of a challenge though, however my son loves it. The characters and story line are pretty neat. It did not take long for my son to catch on."
The product arrived in a timely fashion and was as stated. I had trouble loading it at first because of my security software. I contacted the seller and he helped me understand what I needed to do to download.  I find this product very informative and the interaction helps to understand the language.  For those that purchase this item be aware the parent company has sold the company that manufactures this product so you will not get help from them.  Over all I feel this purchase is satisfactory.
Although the product was a great buy- it comes with a virus that attaches to your web browser- frustrating to find and destroy.
"I installed the 2009 map update the day before leaving for vacation. I stepped off the plane, punched in my first address and while in downtown Providence, RI, my Garmin showed me driving where there was no road; looks like the update didn't include changes made there in the last year or two. After a few frustrating wrong turns and a couple recalculations, it was back on track. It worked better the rest of the trip as far as roads go, but the points-of-interest data is still very out of date. I was in Oakland CA looking for a grocery store, and it took me to a long-abandoned Albertson's (the whole plaza had been closed for quite some time; signs removed, boarded up - good area for a drive-by). I guess I knew this going in based on other reviews, but my old maps were 2006, so I felt I couldn't keep waiting. I'll wait 2 more years and hopefully the 2011 will do better."
"Just a clarification for all reviewers/readers based upon some inaccurate posts..

Parallels is not an emulator, it is a virtualization supervisor running under OS X. Some folks incorrectly call Parallels a hypervisor, but a hypervisor actually runs below any guest operating systems, such as OS X or Windows. Virtualization provides a layer of abstraction between the hardware and the guest operating systems, but the operating system still leverages the native instruction set of the CPU (in this case, Intel CPU) to perform its work. Emulation would involve a translation from one CPU instruction set to another, such is the case with Intel emulation running on a PowerPC CPU (running OS X), where the emulator provides a ""faked"" Intel environment for a guest operating system, where every Intel instruction must be converted to PowerPC for execution. There's a big difference between emulation and virtualization -- Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion are both virtualization supervisors, not emulators as this reviewer states.

Parallels is a great product with very tight Mac/OS X integration.  For the average user, it is probably a slightly better choice than VMware Fusion given a tighter integration with OS X.  However, Fusion is more efficient (but less flexible), and that may make a difference for gamers that tax their systems to the limit from a performance perspective.  If you are not a gamer and are simply looking for OS X and Windows to co-exist, Parallels is going to be a better choice (today -- EMC/VMware is not going to take a beating sitting down, and they have more Intel virtualization experience than any company on the planet, even though mainframe virtualization was invented by IBM in the late '60's)."
"There isn't anything in this new version that jumps out and says ""I'm worth the high price Intuit is charging for me!""  I upgraded from 2012 to 2014, mainly because I upgraded my OS to Windows 8.1 RTM, and I've had several program errors and crashes.  It's unbelievably slow to accept transactions, reconcile the accounts, and similar tasks.  What used to take me 1 second for the click now takes my 7 seconds for the same click.

There are only minor cosmetic changes to the program from what I've seen.  Is it worth upgrading?  Probably not (unless you have 2012 or older and Windows 8.x).  Is it worth the price?  Definitely not.  It would have been nice to see product information on Intuit's website BEFORE this went on sale, and to have the option to purchase an upgrade instead of the full product (again).  Apparently, Intuit does not believe in upgrades.

Additional review: The more I use Quicken 2014, the more I miss Microsoft Money!!  This is definitely not worth the money I spent.  It crashed 6 times while trying to reconcile my accounts over the last 2 hours.  COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!!!  It has messed up the payment amounts for several of my bill reminders (including calculated loans) so now I have to spend additional time to fix those.  If I could give this a -1 star, I would at this point.

I've done as Intuit asked and provided information on what's going on and not a peep out of them."
"I have been using Nortons since the 1980's.
They have added a lot of stuff but it is still the best."
"I love the way the tool works, however the battery life is not very good.  My suggestion is to always have spare batteries near.  I have had the unit quit while on the golf course."
"Once you get this program dialed in, it's a great help to folks like me who hate to type. Easy to set up and the ability to add specific words and phrases used in my particular industry is a great feature."
Keeps my daughter busy and she's learning to read more words.  Not as engaging as others we've tried but it's something different.
"I have been using Turbo Tax for the last ten years and it just gets better every year.  I have to say I am VERY happy I bought it here as a download.  Right in the middle of doing my taxes, my hard drive crashed.  Tried everything to save it but ended up doing a re-image on it.  Then I wondered how I would be able to get Turbo Tax back.  I anticipated that I would be passing emails back and forth with Amazon but NO, they keep it in a library.  All I had to do was click download and I was back in busines.  THANK YOU Amazon!!!!!
Highly recommend this product and really recommend buying it here on Amazon."
I was a heavy user of Photoshop 7 and Create It seemed marginally useful to me in comparison.  I installed the components but never discovered a use for any if them.
I used to read my son the book since he was 2 years old and now that it's on software he reads/plays it himself all day.  He really loves it.
"Great software, I have used it for the last 5 years.  It makes tax filing easy and simple with no fear of errors."
Much better than windows 8.1
So far so good.
"My initial experience with S&T 2008 was that the installation program failed with a meaningless error message typical of older era Microsoft products.  After that I realized that I needed the product key that came with the software.  Activating the MSN Direct Receiver is also problematic telling me that the version of the software doesn't support it.  (Huh?  They came in the same box!)  Online subscription-ware is something that makes life difficult for me.  I rely on the GPS capability when traveling and if I have to reinstall on the road this is going to be problematic.  Plus, I simply don't like 'activation'.  If I could return opened box software I would.  I guess this will be the last time I buy S&T."
"I have always used Norton or McAfee, and I am not sure why I bought Kaspersky this year.  One of my computers was infected with a virus within a month after purchase, and the ""Technical Help"" was not very helpful but offered to clean my computer for a fee.  I ended up doing a full system recovery, uninstalled Kaspersky, and purchased McAfee.  I also uninstalled from the rest of my computers, since it really impacted system performance, and erroneously blocked downloads I needed when doing my taxes."
"This software package is just what I needed and the merchant offered a great price. It took a while for the disks to arrive, but the price and quality made it well worth the wait."

"I've had Macs since they first came out. I'm not an expert but do enjoy the Mac system. As the hard drives get larger and the range of use expanding on all computers, there are going to be maintenance issues. I'm a home movie guy and have huge movie files which means lots of data to maintain. Techtool 5 works great on my iMac 24"", 2.4 Hz, running latest operating system 10.6.6. I have never used e partition (creating an E drive) successfully but maybe because there is a better way. On a Mac you can't clean up your main drive from running TechTool Pro 5 on the drive. Instead, partition your main drive into volume 1 and 2 with 2 being smaller. Put a new OS on volume two and then load Techtool Pro 5 onto the 2nd volume. When you are using your main volume (#1) and have some OS issues, shut down volume 1 and start up in volume 2. From #2 clean up volume #1. This works much quicker than inserting Techtool disc into computer. It takes a long time to use the disk to clean up your main drive . . . but it will do it.

Techtool Pro 5 does about 99% of all needed clean up. It'll also do the defragmentation, some recovery, etc. But the ""clean up"" maintenance is a routine thing everyone needs to do . . . like changing the oil in your car. Its sort of the same thing. Do it and life is better.

And if you don't want to partition your main drive, get an external drive and put an OS on it, and download from disc the Techtool Pro 5 program. You'll have same advantage . . . just costs more, for the drive, and its one more device to maintain (wires, power supply, etc).

Good luck. Enjoy your Mac! A great machine . . . not perfect but not bad. Get Techtool Pro 5!! (No I don't work for Techtool Pro 5 or have anything to do with them. It's just a good product.)"
"I have this on my iPhone, tablet, Kindle and 2 pc's so i can read my book anywhere, Dr's waiting room, airport, anywhere I have to wait in line i just get out my phone and read.  Sometimes i have a syncing problem but its not really a huge deal i just flick through the pages."
"I downloaded this so I could read a magazine I purchased, but it appears that I cannot use this software to read them."
"I have been using turbo tax for the past three years - no
problem - answers every questions - I would not be without it"
"Quicken has been my Mac go-to finance tracker for many years.  But, I could not upload files from Quicken 2007 although I tried many, many times, many, many ways.  Moreover, the conversion process was redundant and confusing.  i am going back to 2007, which is the best ever system for my Mac osx 10.6.8.  When they get conversion, I'll try a new one again."
Exactly what I was looking for and arrived quickly.  Will continue to purchase my paper products here.
"I have used this for a couple of weeks now, bringing trip pictures in, adjusting them, printing or exporting them.  I had an earlier version of this software, and this one is easier to use.  I can adjust/fix/change a picture in a number of ways.  I am a rank amateur, my kid can use this to do hundreds of things, easily, that I have to think through.  Therefore, ease of use is my number one goal, and this is pretty easy to use, hard to screw up.

So, for a not-professional, this is pretty neat for not-professional purposes...."
"This, for the most part, sucks. If you're wanting to do any sort of gameplay videos, do not get this. I had to reduce the screen size of my game by nearly half, and even then there was a lot of lag (the game works smoothly fullscreen without this on btw). Go with something else, try screen-cast-omatic--the free version of that was better than the paid version of this."
I have used this product as well as the PRO product for years and it has proven to do the job
This program helped solidify our home building ideas and gave us more confidence in bidding contractors.  It made us less at the mercy of a contractors designs and allowed us to play around with ideas.  This program has accelerated our time table for contractor bidding and final plans.  The reason this program does not get five stars as the stair designing is difficult when you have changes in floor depth 9' vs 10' vs 12' and its hard to keep some interior walls exactly the same.
"I have been using Turbo Tax for over 10 years, now they changed what forms can be filed with their basic version and charge you $70 to upgrade.  This is the last time I ever use them.  I'm switching to H&R Block from now on.  Good bye Turbo Tax. You will only cheat me once!!"
Had a Trojan horse virus and ransom ware and it stopped it cold
"I love this program!!! I used Webeasy pro 5, this is not much different, but they are both great and very very easy. The only thing I wish one could do is edit the html inside the program somehow. Otherwise it is perfect!"
Thought Music came w/ Prime - does not so i did not end up purchasing.
Although this product is pretty expensive it is a very good product and is great if you are doing any detox.  Replenishes your system with everything you need to rebuild.  My husband used it to detox from Aspartame.  We really believe this product made a huge difference in his improvement.
I've used this robot combo for about 2 years now and I'm always trying others. For the last 24 months this one has not been beat.
"Absolutely love it. Some controls are easy and familiar. Others are complicated (have had to search online for videos on how to do certain tasks). I love the detail and quality. I love the controls and things you can do, however have had other software that in comparison that has more options for editing (that I paid less for I might add). Overall I would rate this 4 stars."
"The Cook'N 2000 software needs lots of improvement. First, The interface is not intuitive and there is no user manual included. I met or exceeded all the system specs for this product, yet I received database errors that  froze up the program when logging-in, after updating just one recipe.  Mulitply this by the constant ""reminders"" to register the product  with DVO enterprises:a register.exe command is inserted in your win.ini  file, causing the reminder to pop-up even when you aren't using the  program. There is also the requirement that the CD must be inserted into  the drive to run the program, already installed onto your PC, adding  another straw to the camel's back.
I have since purchased a MasterCook  5.0 product and have been extremely happy--it has a very user-friendly and  intuitive interface, comes with a detailed user book (if you need it), you  can easily add your own recipes, it delivers wonderful recipes, runs  without the CD inserted, and costs about the same."
"Downloaded the trial version for 30 days. It was a big learning curve coming from gimp, but nice features for the price"
I could not get it to install it was not compatible.
"A couple of years ago, I was going to France, so I bought ""Learn to Speak French Deluxe"" By the Learning Company.  After 8-9 hours, I felt like I could perform basic tasks in French, like ordering, asking direction, checking into a hotel, buying a train ticket...

Now, I'm headed to Italy, so I looked for a comparable product, but unfortunately, there is no ""Learn to Speak Italian"".  I found Tell Me More Italian and it seemed to be the best option.

First of all, it cost about 5x what my very effective French software had cost.  Then, when I installed it and tried it out, I found it to be very complicated, much more so than necessary, and WAY over my head in terms of helping me to learn anything.  I started with the ""Beginning"" level, only to find dialog, drills, videos entirely in Italian with no explanation.  Here's an example... the VERY FIRST lesson asks you to respond appropriately to phrases spoken in a dialog.  So, the reader says something in Italian and there are a handful of choices all in Italian and I'm supposed to pick an appropriate one.  I don't even know what the reader just said, let alone what the responses mean.  There is no translation, no explanation.

When I was considering buying this product, I did a lot of research.  I found many, many reviews that complained that it threw you too quickly into the Italian with no explanation.  I thought to myself that those people were just wimps that didn't understand that you don't learn a language by memorizing vocabulary.  I already speak Spanish fluently, so I figured, ""Oh, yeah, I can hanle it""... boy was I wrong.  I should have headed the warnings.

What a waste of money (and, unfortunately, time)."
"I can't imagine trying to write without this program after having used it for a short time.  I got started and had to buy a book on using it because it is a bit intimidating  at first, but once I figured out (and I'm still a beginner) how to use the basic features, I was HOOKED.  I love how I can use the index card feature for outlining and how it tracks things, how it is searchable, and so many other reasons.
No serious writer should be without this program, it's just, simply, that good."
"I'm using a MacBook Pro and every once in a while it will quit unexpectedly.
 I'm sure they will work these problems out. It does have the potential to be better than sound Forge 10 which I use every day on my PC.  I just upgraded to 11 and so far I don't see any real different features from 10.
 I hope they can work out the glitches with sound Forge on the Apple so I can wean off of my windows and start using the Apple, it just works better for audio and video in my opinion."
nice
"Actually I give it ZERO stars but that's not an option. Tried several times to download this software on my NEW Dell computer. After installation, it asks permission to update program with patch. The Punch Update Installer does not work, causes error. Either way if you try to update or not, you cannot use the program, the error prevents it from opening and you cant open it without updating. Do Not Buy This Product"
"Kaspersky failed to support their product installation. I have some leftover files from a previous program that won't allow me to load the Kaspersky Internet Security software. They sent me a link to remove to files but the link was bad and the phone number they gave me to contact the software company was invalid. They (Kaspersky) would not help, I would give negative stars if I could, they have very poor customer support as far as I am concerned. I will gladly change this review when they decide to support their product installation."
"I've had both Final Draft 5 & 6, but just bought a brand new laptop, so I figured I should probably upgrade. Bad idea...
Long story short, I ended up uninstalling it and sending it back. For some reason, 6 works better.
Oh, and forget about using Collabowriter on 7. I was told by their own tech people this is never going to work because of new security features built into the new operating systems."
I just hope I can get more help this year from Intuit
I have used this for years. A god program and easy to use.
Free Kindle works great..no extra IPad needed. just download your e-book and start reading. great.
"I'm surprised at the poor reviews. Apparently, the packaging issue has been resolved, as my discs were not glued to the box. That aside, I LOVE this program! I took Spanish in high-school, over 20 years ago. I didn't do well then, and have forgotten all but ""hola,"" and ""gracias,"" since then. The first few lessons were pretty easy, very basic, but I was amazed at how quickly my vocabulary grew. I put the audio companion in my car, and can actually picture what they're saying without any translation. I'm stunned! I'm close to the end of level one, and it's gotten a bit more difficult. But at the end of each little section, I am joyfully surprised at what I'm actually retaining. This program is great!"
this Java IDE.  It compiled the best features from the competition and packaged it together in one slick product. The best out there!
"I'm a graphic artist. I'm always downloading trials of new software to help me with new designs and projects. With that said, I've inadvertently downloaded my fair share of spyware. Trend Micro didn't stop my computer from connecting online and interrupting me during projects. This BitDefender version did the trick and I can now focus on my projects. I can't even tell when it's running... but its definitely making a big difference so far."
"I have to say that the Portugal/Spain microchip got us through most of the country side quite succcessfully (minus some confusion in the 1zillion roundabouts). In general, no complaints!"
Bought as present for niece. Review as per her opinion. Navigation awkward and graphics a little dated. You have to take your own notes as no auto log to keep track of things. The sixth in the series but not the best-still fun but would prefer more depth.
"I love this product. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it would be nice to have a choice of aquarium backgrounds. To be able to change that once in a while would be nice. Other than that, being able to change the lighting and the fish is great. They look very realistic... almost as good... but in some ways better than a real aquarium. You don't have to worry about cleaning the tank or having the fish die. My granddaughter loves it and wants it to play all of the time. I love having the soothing bubble sound. I had to turn the bubble column off because it didn't pay properly, but once I did that, I still had the sound just not the bubbles. Love it."
"The advertisements and the box say that it copies Hollywood movies.  When I tried to copy one of my movies it told me that it could not copy a copy-protected DVD and it recommended finding shareware that would first decrypt the software.  What a rip-off!  Don't waste your money.  I miss the days when you could buy DVDXCopy.

Anyone that says they don't need to make backup copies of their DVDs has never had kids.  The surface of a DVD does not survive long with a 3 year old trying to put it in to the DVD player.  :-)"
"Used Norton 2005.  Upgraded to 2006.

Norton 2006 slowed my machine down to a crawl.

Went to ZoneAlarm.  Very happy with it.

Always try to wait for Free-After-Rebate deals on these if you can.  All I've paid for any of these is sales tax and/or shipping for the past five years."
"I have been using Quicken Essentials for Mac for a while and it works really well for a Mint like view of my financial state with a Mac interface that I really like. It is missing some of the great features of Quicken for Windows, Like savings goals accounts. I really like the application for the Mac and it is getting support from Intuit on a regular basis. My ultimate goal is to migrate from Quicken for Windows to Quicken essentials for MAC, and it is almost there for me."
"I bought this a long time ago, and I still use it.  I love my Mac, and I love MS Office 2008 for Mac.  I will upgrade both soon."
"I ordered it because I wanted the cd. If I had wanted to download it, I would have gone to the website, not paid to have a piece of paper mailed to me that directs me to their terrible website."
great
"As a working mom on maternity leave, I was trying to use this to automate my current process- about 50 recipes get used from a couple of books and a lot of single pages torn from magazines, monthly I make a meal plan and weekly I revise it and put together a grocery list.  The headaches are in finding the recipes, determining the grocery list, and minorly in setting up the monthly plan to keep from having spaghetti every night.  I have started entering my recipes and have about 32 in- I consider it drudgery, but the software is somewhat helpful.  Iam now playing with how it generates a grocery list, and I am thinking the software is trying to be too smart- trying to determine what size of a container I need to buy rather than what was written on the recipe, and I certainly don't want to be told brand names- I just want a SIMPLE grocery list, and would prefer to eliminate the brand names- seems like advertising I don't need.  I plan to keep fiddling with this product and get as much use out of it that I can.  Overall, I think its a good product if there aren't better recipe programs out there yet."
"Better Quicken than I expected. Quicken seems to always over promise and under deliver. This product does seem to be sound enough to handle the current financial fundamentals and integrated with mobile and internet access to a base line of comparable products. Quicken still holds out for updates and integration forthcoming...which could leave us still waiting for the best product for this market to produced by Intuit. They have promising the ""best"" since before the 2007 version for Mac. Overall a good product and workable to date."
"Good prize for a complete security solution, i feel very happy with this product, pc works smooth, simple User Interface, easy to install, and registration was not too complicated like i read somewhere, so i recommended to buy this, for they want a A/V works well and don't have a lot of graphics useless..."
"I have some of the national geographic state topo maps, and they do print a little prettier than these, but these will give you an overlay with the street names. They have all the detail of the USGS topo maps plus the streets. For $50 I think it is the buy of the century."
Good program
"Before considering buying this product I checked Quicken's support options.  Incredibly, this version doesn't even show up on their support page!  Also, there is no telephone support.  If you e-mail them, it can take 2 days to get a response.

No thanks!"
"Software download was seamless, G Data software successfully removed previous security software without problem. I purchased a ""3 pack"" - 3 downloads for one price, but wasn't patient enough to get all peripheral information before I started downloads, and wound up with questions Amazon could not answer. I contacted G Data directly, and the response and intervention by G Data Customer Service was quick and efficient. Problem was taken care of immediately. I was absolutely impressed, which is why I am writing this review. Awesome product, awesome Customer Service. This one deserves your attention!"
"Warning - I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my father. He attempted to use the software to no avail.  We had the serial number, but it required a password that we could not obtain.  My father made numerous attempts to resolve this issue through Nero, however they were useless.  It took days for them to reply, and the person replying had not a clue. In fact, they insuated that it was stolen, even when an amazon receipt was supplied. My father has had this software since Christmas - and he still hasn't used it.  I must say Amazon.com has been great.  They are going to reimburse my account and I am sending the product back to where it came from."
"YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SCAN THIS PRODUCT BEFORE MAILING IT TO ME, SO IT DOES NOT WORK, YOU HAVE WASTED HOURS OF MY TIME WITH MCAFEE TRYING TO GET IT TO WORK YOU IDIOTS!!!"
I give it a A+
"These maps revolutionized travel. I remember when I had to stop on the road side to open a big map and memorize a few turns to be able to reach my destination. But, that's not the best. The most important use is in city traffic. How many road go thru small cities and you have no idea how to achieve the other side of the town? How many walled cities have just a few entraces and many of them are one way streets? Having these maps save you a lot of aggravation and may be a few tickets. It worked very well for our trip to Spain and I recommend to use"
"I have been using Quickbooks and payroll services since, I think, 2005.  I have looked at other options but have found that QuickBooks is the easiest to use for me.  It is also seamless with my accountant services.  2014 I think has a better appearance over the previous version.  I do not have complex accountant pracitices and do my own payroll.  It is easy for me to use and anytime that I needed to get help from Intuit it was great.  Thanks for a great product and support!"
I did not read what came with this program close enough.  I did not know that Outlook was not included.  I loaded it and then learned I had to buy Professional Plus and could not use the program I bought.  So make sure you know what is included in this version.  I completely respect that my rating is because I did not purchase the right thing.
"A little more complicated than i expected.  I am pretty much a novice and have used imovie 08 for a little over a year.  I felt like i had outgrown that application and many of my videos started to have the same look/feel so i decided to move up to FCE.  I signed up for the one to one at the apple store for instruction.  in 2 x 1 hour sessions i have a pretty decent understanding about how the application works.  If i did not sign up for one to one, i'm not sure i would have gotten anywhere.  If you don't have access to a apple store/ one to one for training class i'm not sure i would get this product."
"When I got the Kindle for PC app, I was hoping to be able to read my Kindle magazine subscription (Soap Opera Digest) on my Laptop, but found it wasn't possible."
It is full of great questions for you; many of these resources take you way beyond testing day
"This was purchased for my 4 year old who loves my little pony. She has a leappad video game system and wasn't really using it that much anymore, so we got her this game and she loves it! It's great to give her when dining out to keep her entertained. Seems like a cute game. Happy with this purchase."
"I love taking pictures with my digital camera and enjoy sharing them with family and friends. Paintshop ProX5 allows me to organize and edit my pictures as well as to share them with family and friends.

It is important for me to have an easy to use photo editing software.  This software is easy enough for someone like me to use but has features that an advanced user would enjoy.

There are three tabs at the top of the screen that help a person use the software.  The tabs are manage, adjust and edit.

The manage tab deals with organizing photos, identifying them and rating them.  The adjust tab allows you to use a lot of different features to adjust the sharpness, tone, brightness and contrast of a picture. The edit tab allows you to edit photos in more ways than I care to list.  There is an adjust option in the edit tab that allows a person to use many of the features in the adjust tab.

I have yet to use the adjust and edit features completely but I could see a professional being able to do very complicated tasks. The help menu is great and there are ways to do quick fixes which allow the software to fix up a picture for you.  I have had this software for a couple of months and am still learning all that I can do.

Paintshop ProX5 has helped me to better organize my photos. More importantly, I have been able to make okay pictures into really nice ones."
"There is almost nothing this recipe program won't do for you.  OK, it won't cook the food but it will collect your recipes and recipes you find on the web through it's internet browser.  You can even use your iPhone or iPod to scan and save print or handwritten recipes - think of all those old, spattered and used recipes of Grandma's.  You can make and print a cookbook of your own and even send it off to have it printed.  You can email recipes to friends.  I can scale recipes for my family of 2 now that we are empty nesters or if the family visits I can scale recipes for the number of people for whom I am cooking.  I can make menus and lists which can be sent to my Kindle Fire or iPod to use for shopping and cooking.  The program will even give you nutritional values.

A big part of getting this software is the support which goes with it.  I had a problem and support worked with me until it was solved.

You just can't go wrong with this software.  I have used others, but none live up to this one."
Webroot Secure Anywhere is a very easy to use program while at the same time seems to be very effective.  The various processes completed in about one minute.
"I am a piano teacher and use this game for my students. This a very cute way to learn a basic of music theory for very beginners. Kids love it! What a fun way of the material delivery! The most complicated and boring material  as value of notes and rests presented here like the most enjoyable games for ""little people"" (:-),always ""requestable"" between them.
 When you will be learning the software,go to the end,don't drop it in the middle because In the begging it looks like too slow. Might be slow for you,but not fo 5-6 year olsd ones."
"My husband is self-employed, and Turbo Tax makes our taxes so much easier than doing the old way.  I really like how it walks us through everything we ned to remember to include. Saves us a lot of money over having an accountant do our taxes."
"I love this software, but beware...IT DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS 10.  Be sure to read what it is compatible with....I did not.  Common sense, I should have but was so excited when I saw it that I just ordered it.  AND, it is not returnable once you open the package  :(.  Another option is CreataCard Gold Tree, Version 3, but be sure it is compatible with Windows 10."
"You might think that version 10 of any product would have to be pretty bulletproof, but you would be wrong. I wasted two days trying to convert an mpeg to a dvd. I finally downloaded two shareware products that worked perfectly the first time (one to convert the mpeg to a dvd image, the other to burn the dvd image to a dvd).

Even the Media Creator program launcher could not close without crashing. Thankfully, Sonic offers a 30 day money back guarantee. However, I wish that I could bill Sonic for the time that I spent debugging their product.

It may seem obvious to suggest that Sonic improve their QA processes, but I must. This product should not have been released in its current state."
I bought this because it seemed like a good deal. This might be a program suitable for a more complicated business than self employed use. This was too detailed for just keeping up with profit & loss and no employees. Would have returned it but software once opened can't be returned.
"When Kasperkey labs failed me, I turned to Norton.  I switched from Norton years ago because of it's intrusive nature but the new interface is great and even shows you it's system usage which is 99% of the time a nice 0.  The price is great for the protection you get.  Excellent job."
"I can't believe computer users all over the world have not revolted over windows 8 and windows 8.1.  What a bug infected POS. I have had it for one year of continuous problems and hour after hour of tech support help.  I am not literate in all the technology to explain the problems I've had (have).  Please, if you value you sanity, stay away from this software."
"I knew this was used (there were no new ones available, or probably in production) but it would have been nice to know that that the platform is WIN/MAC 2000/95/98.  I have 7 computers in this house and none are old enough to support this old old old software.  Just wasted $50"
"I am very happy with my purchase. I covered three of my five PCs with this. Very good at self updating and scanning, which is perfect for my less savvy family users. Norton isn't my favorite, but it seems to work really well. It has been catching stuff on my sons computer. I am happy with my purchase."
I always use Turbo Tax
The Office Home and Student is perfect for what I needed.  I have had Office before and never used the Publishing or other parts of the full package.  I believe that this is the perfect blend of programs that fit my needs and at a lower price point.  Some of the new features in the Windows Word and Excel are worth the upgrade.
"This product is a nightmare. Adobe no longer supports their stand-alone products other than by blog and chat. After hours and hours of time on both, I finally got Lightroom 6 to load, only to discover the next day that Photoshop is now disabled. Now even trying to reinstall Photoshop CS5 from my disk results in failure. I have never been so frustrated with a company and it's lack of support."
"As a vine reviewer, I'm obligated to review items and have no way of notifying amazon that I never actually received an item, such is the case with this software. So I give it three stars for being the kind of product it is. Any product that helps you save your valuable data is well worth the money. They may be better products out there and I'm sure there are worse ones too (hence the three star rating), but something is better than nothing. Read the reviews of those that were fortunate enough to actually try the product and if it seems easy to use and something you might actually do, it's worth every penny."
Good OS. Bad metro.
"I am loving this program, and the shipping arrived just as expected. Thank you so much!!"
"I have been using, recommending and installing Avast free Antivirus for over 6 years! It's protection and minimal resource requirements are unparalleled. Hands down my first choice and first recommendation to all of my friends! Coupled with the leading Maleware protection, in my mind, there's no better solution to today's online threats. Plus it is the only antivirus to offer Boot-time scanning!"
"I used the product key to activate Word as well as Excel and the other listed products. It worked the first time, so whats not to love?"
"Been using Norton for many years. Has some quirks, but does the job."
"Sometimes I don't want to update software, I have this thing that if everything is working fine, why introduce problems and spend money at the same time. I was running with quicken 2011 just fine, then in July my software stopped working property, it would no longer download into my quicken from my bank.
I kept working around the problem, and decided today that I had enough, so I spent a lot of time trying to get it working. Then the software tells me some banks will not allow you to download unless you use the latest software, such as Quicken 2013. I spent the $49.00 and suddenly the software worked again. I think that is what I call ""crap""..... One of these days I think i will get rid of quicken and go someone else, but I need time to undertake something like that."
"Does not have realty purchased or sold on this one. Have used turbo tax for more than 10 years, worst experience ever."
great product. exactly what i was looking for.
It was easy to load but i thought it was for a year.  Once it got here it said 6 months.
The price is the only reason why it's 4 stars.
My toddler children loved these games! They were challenging and entertaining while teaching. Super product! Most of the Blue's Clues line of games were  wonderful tools for learning through play. This one was one of the even better ones.
"Got this with my new tablet and was looking forward to giving it a go. Unfortunately the colours are all wrong on my main monitor. The canvas is always a pale yellow though it insists that it is in fact white. Switching to a secondary monitor fixes the issue after a moment but it's not an issue with the main monitors colour settings as white appears fine in other programs. Furthermore the yellow remains after moving over to the other monitor until after the window-drag has been released. If I had to guess I would say somewhere in the software someone thought they would try to colour correct for the monitor and got it wrong.

Can't speak for the rest of the software as the colour issue is a bit of a blocker but will revise my opinion if it's ever fixed."
"I purchased this product after downloading, installing, and using an AVG 2014 Trial. I found the Trial to be an easy to use, set it and forget it product, just what I was looking for. The Trial came with everything I needed (including) the Firewall, Well, after purchasing the product and downloading and installing it I was rudely surprised by the Firewall area in the control panel missing and a dialog box telling me to upgrade to the 2014 AVG product - $46.74 per year. Well AVG, this is the 2014 AVG product and the Firewall is supposed to be in it. I tried downloading the file again and fixing the install from the menu with the same results, no Firewall.

Also, it's going to important for customers of this product to know that this not the only component missing from the control panel of the AVG suite, it seems AVG has made most all of the other selections to be  payware as well including ""Mobile antivirus security pro - $9.99"", ""Tablet Antivirus Security Pro - $14.99"", (why anyone would buy a license for 3 devices for two years and not get these two important additions included is amazing), ""The Driver Update Software - only $29.99"", the ""Fix Performance Tune-up only $39.95"", Family Safety 1 year of protection only $49.95"", ""Tech Buddy - just $15 per year"", ""Reputation.com - only $10 per month"", ""LiveKive Free Trial, no mention of how much this service which apparently allows one to sync their Mac and PC, costs. So, as you can see, there is not much included in the 2014 AVG Suite with 2 years of updates on 3 machines. I have contacted Amazon to hopefully get a refund on this purchase, as I believe the product is deceptive if it does not include the Firewall which is in the Trial. I will update this post with hopefully a refund, or, the Firewall addition which the Trial includes and this suite is supposed to have as well."
"I do not usually participate in writing reviews but my experience with this company has changed my mind. I ordered this product to try and see if it would be helpful in transcribing family diaries written in the 1800s. When the new version came out, I received a call from Nuance trying to sell me the new version. I explained that my needs did not include much more than this one project and I was fine with what I had and was not interested in anything more. I have been bombarded with phone calls several times a week, emails daily and more junk in my mailbox than I can count. I have never been subjected to such aggressive sales tactics from any company as I have from this company. For that reason, I will NEVER purchase another product from this company again and hope readers will be warned if they are considering purchasing from this company."
"I use this software in a GPS Map 76CS when riding an ATV. It shows many existing ATV and snowmobile trails, sometimes with the trail name. It also shows most logging roads, with names where applicable. Streams, lakes, and ponds are also listed. It's very accurate, and makes it easy to see where you are in relation to known landmarks. It's just what I was looking for!"
I love this software to no end. It helps me to stay away from bad area of the internet.
"I had seen this in Walmart the other day and just decided to purchase it, because the box made it look good to help edit and create simple videos for YouTube. My first video I went to edit was gonna be a PnP player mode video and the box had clearly stated it will create PnP videos. It took me a while to find out how to do it with the basic edition. Changed my picture into a horrible pixelated mess. Got the picture in the corner, but at the sacrifice of quality. Watched a few videos on how to do some editing with the software and thought that's easy. It was for the Platinum edition and the quality was way better than what I was looking at. I would save your money for a better program or buy the Platinum instead unless your just cutting and doing simple transitions for home videos.
I forgot to put in the review that you can try out there products for 30 days if you visit there site and download software. At least you will know if it's for you or not!"
My kids really love the game style of learning.
Works fine! Doesn't come with Outlook. That was disappointing! And that is why I gave 4 out of 5 stars
"Fulfills my needs without going overboard.  This is one of the few picture-editing programs I've found that will let you change just one color in your image to another color.
I took off one star only because sometimes when changing the size of the image, in pixels, the result is a 11 pixel image.  This requires an Undo, and a re-attempt to change size, in inches."
"If you like budgeting with your older version of Quicken - DO NOT UPGRADE TO THIS PRODUCT.
Has a rolling budget that does not allow you to use a Jan to Dec format (unless
you change the computer clock!! per someone at Quicken).
Budget doesnt even give you totals of income vs. expenses - you have
to get your calculator out if you want to see the resulting total per month.
Crap Crap Crap."
Really am impressed by the App. It gives me the convenience of anything on my kindle I can have on my PC.  Having my books and apps on either devise is great!
If you are looking for an inexpensive alternative to Adobe's PDF Creator Scansoft PDF Create is it!
Not compatible with Windows 10
Great product for the money.  I lost my product key so I can't install it on my husband's computer or laptop.  Have tried to contact vender but there has been no response.
Recommended for anyone learning the basics of Photoshop Elements 10. Easy to follow step by step guide. Videos make an easy way to learn.
This is the best program to convert all of my files from different cameras and different formats from videos; even them downloaded from the web. The progam is intuitive and very fast to be used without anyproblem to resolve how to see different videos that the people send you around the word and you have difficults to see inmediatly. For my was the best solution and recommend this program.
"Like all Microsoft Office Suites, great software combination but always can use a bit of work."
Its good for fixing the bugs
"I have paid for Norton online backup for years. I paid for extra space so I knew all my files would be backed up automatically.  I use my computer for a consulting business & it was worth it for me to have the assurance that everything was safe.  My computer crashed 12 days ago.  I have been trying to restore my files from Norton every day since then.  I have spent hours on tech support calls.  I am currently listening to hold music.  My phone says we've been on hold for 2 1/2 hours.  They claim that there is ""maintenance"" being done on the server which contains my files, but their description of the problem changes with every call/ chat session. There is no professional follow through, or special concern that this is not business as usual. In fact one tech guy in a candid moment admitted that the service was not intended for large blocks of data. (Why did they happily charge me of all that space??) The ""maintenance"" has been going on for 12 days now & they are telling me to wait 4 more days to try again.

So they are VERY good at selling their product, collecting the money & wasting the customer's time if you actually need to restore anything!!!

"very user friendly, prompts you thru every category, a big help for self employed businesses, highly recommended by many ."
"I purchased this as an upgrade from an Office Professional 2003 version that I had originally installed in an XP, then later re-installed  on my Windows7.  I installed this upgrade on the Windows7 with no problems -- installation was easy and intuitive (but make sure your older licensed version is resident on your PC before installing this upgrade)."
My granddaughter loves this game!!
"I bought this edition (had Premier 2012) because of the much touted ability to access Quicken via moble devices. This may work well for those whose entire portfolio is based in the U.S.A. and who have no investments to track. But people with investments overall and any accounts in foreign currencies will only see their U.S. dollar based accounts - a major flaw. The balance of the ""upgrades"" is basically irrelevant eye candy on which it's not worth spending money. Finally, for people whose Windows computers run foreign language OSs, you will get an annoying message to change language settings for non Unicode programs to U.S. English every time you open and close Quicken and may have some functionality impared. It today's global world, this is patently unacceptable. However, Quicken support knows of no plans to address this."
"We have three of the Scooby Doo Case File Games.
My four year old loves these games. He will play it for a long time. There is problem solving and mazes and other activities in each game.
My problem with this game (and the other Scooby Games) is that there is no variability. Once your child solves the game and plays it again, the puzzles are essentially the same. The clues might change and the villian might be different, but the puzzles are the same and the clues are in the same places.
This is not a problem for my kids though. They both enjoy the game and play it for many hours.
Enjoy."
I've been using Quicken since 1994 and haven't been disappointed.  My only wish is that Intuit would supply a LIFETIME license for a FEE so I don't have to keep purchasing this every few years.
"I've been a slave to Microsoft for too many years, and using iWork '08 proves it to me.  This software is fantastic for students, academics, and now with the inclusion of Numbers, for the business world as well.  As someone who will complete graduate school soon, I can promise you that this will be the software of choice in my office.

Templates are well thought out and it's easy to add more templates by creating your own or visiting a number of other sites on the web where templates are shared.  This is a real step up from my Office experiences of the past."
"I used H&R Block Deluxe two years in a row.  Both times, the software miscalculated the estimated taxes paid (by a significant amount) when carrying the total over from the worksheet to the 1040 form.  I had to overwrite the total which then prevented me from efiling.  I contacted H&R Block twice (each year) to report the problem, describing the problem in detail to several people as I was passed off to different departments, but they did not fix it.

If you pay estimated taxes, verify the total carried over from your worksheets to the 1040 form. It is possible the company has not fixed the bug in their software yet.  I purchased TurboTax this year so that I can efile - their software correctly carried over the estimated taxes."
"Have used their products (Deluxe plus state) for nearly 20 years.  Never had a problem.  Support site inlcudes phone help and in past years chat support although I don't see that for the 2015 tax year.  One annoyance is that even into March the program continues to download updates.  Sorry guys, but tax law hasn't changed much from 2015 and it is well-known well before the end of the previous year.  At $40 in my opinion it is overpriced so wait until they have rebates or sales."
"Purchased this to upgrade my Vista computer. After installing, I downloaded the Windows 10 software from Microsoft. It was easy to install. I didn't use Windows 8, just upgraded right to 10, so I can't say too much more. Software arrived in a timely manner."
In my opinion this is the suite on the market
"The program itself is a good tool for learning a foreign language.  However, I ordered directly from the company  (early advantage), and the quality of the actual dvds is horrid.  I've had to call and request replacement dvds because the center of the each dvd is cracking and beginning to chip away.  I wouldn't complain, except this is te THIRD time it has happened, and now the company claims it's 'most unusual' for this to happen.  The first two representatives I spoke with (last year), admitted that the dvds were part of a batch that had problems with this cracking.  However, the person today said that was not the case, and they need to physically inspect the dvds before they can replace them.  Who knows how long that will take.  Their customer service went from a 10 to a 1 (10 being great, 0, non-existent) in my book.  Too bad, because the program is a great way to get my kids familiar with a foreign language."
"I can't stress enough how much I dislike accounting for my business. That said, since including QuickBooks into my suite of business my life has become infinitely easier. If I ever get caught in an area that I am uncertain about, QuickBooks makes it simple enough to figure out - plus the FAQ is simple and answers almost all questions.

Can't recommend it enough."
"Buyer beware: Customer support is unbelievably poor. Quicken requires paid updates every few years - okay, fine, I understand. I have been a loyal customer of Intuit products for about 15 years. My product is 2 years old; it will ""sunset"" next year. For now: the password has stopped working. I changed it on the Intuit site, but the error message remains in Quicken: ""Hmm. That didn't work."" That's LITERALLY the error message. Last year this happened; through a Quicken support group I found I needed to uninstall and reinstall the program to get rid of a faulty patch issued by Intuit. I can't do that this time, because Quicken has pulled the program download from Amazon's website - so it's no longer available. I can't reinstall; I can only purchase an updated product. (No thank you--it's not time yet.) Can I contact Quicken? Yes, IF I WANT TO PAY FOR ASSISTANCE. Quicken only provides free support for ""current"" products, and my 2014 product is no longer considered current in 2016. Okay: maybe I'm willing to pay. But Quicken won't tell me what it will cost until after I get the assistance.
In summary: I paid for the product, expecting 3 years of use. I used it properly. Now it does not work, and the company wants me to pay to find out how to solve a problem the company created (and acknowledged a year ago)."
"I just love this program.  I have bought every version when they come out..  I especially love the calendar; I always plan a week's meal at a time, make my grocery list and then I have everything I need to cook at my fingertips.  I will continue buying new versions as they come out."
ok
Same TaxCut as always...adequate for the job.
"I confess, I've been using OS 9.2.1 for a long time, and I still use it a lot of the time. But I wanted to make the transition to OS X, and OS X.2 has been quite a lure for me.
I really like it. A LOT. I had zero problems installing it on my older G4 ""Yikes"" (PCI graphics) Mac. At 400 MHz, it's not the fastest Mac out there, but it  still runs OS X.2 just fine. (I'm sure the 512 megs of RAM I have helps too.) Also, this G4's 16 MB Rage video card can't do the Quartz Extreme thing, but so what? There's plenty to like about OS X.2  besides that. I am enjoying my time with OS X.2 more and more. Highly recommended."
Great price as compared to doing the usual upgrade with Norton or purchasing in-store via Best Buy or Wal-Mart.
"Reliable
Secure
Easy to use
Isn't that what MS promises with each new release? Red Hat has been providing all three for years now. This release is the best so far. You don't need to be a computer nerd to know how to use it. I find it simpler to use that Windows XP! If all you use your PC for is to surf the web, e-mail, and chat, then this is for you. KDE, and Mozilla are great, and getting better all the time. If you want to be stuck in the upgrade cycle, that is windows, then stay away from this. When you use it, you'l never go back. It's all you need in an operating system and more. (Redhat comes with Star Office, and the Gimp), you get everthing that would cost you... (Office XP and Adobe Photoshop) if you went with windows. That alone is a good enough reason to try it out. You might just be surpised with what you find"
"Well, let's see... I've been a major Norton software fan since the late 60's... okay at least since I bought my 286 many years ago. Now I have a 1.4GHz Pentium III running Windows ME, and I'm getting errors and lockups all over the place. I don't think I should blame Norton for this one as I think it's an ""ME"" issue, but turning off Norton often solves the problems. So, my advice? If you've got Windows ME, don't mix it with Norton Internet Security 2001."
My teen daughter is so happy to relive her younger years.
Its nothing speacial and you still need to go in and manually clear your cache
"Wow. The depths of how bad this product is defy easy description. I am a professional power-user of Word for 10+ years, and even with a separately purchased manual, it was incredibly hard to learn. Heaven help the non-technical person who just wants to write a letter, a student paper, or a business document, especially one who doesn't want to use Microsoft's hideous templates. Does anyone inside of Microsoft Corp really use those templates for a professional project or for their social groups??? Yikes. And then, wait for it... the classic Microsoft moment... and then THE WHOLE THING BLOWS UP. Simple search and replace and BOOM, all of your work is gone! This happened to me over and over with clean documents. It seems like you have to buy this product because it is the default. AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS."
"There are serious problems with EasyStep, the way TurboTax takes you through filling in the information for the return.  It is only because I'm knowledgeable about taxes and a software developer that i managed to get my return correct.  And deviation from simply stepping through, one item after another, leads to trouble.  Simply going back, using to back button, to change something can cause important screens to be skipped.

It is a real disappointment.  Intuit used to be one of the very best software companies.

I certainly don't want to recommend that people by the Microsoft product.  I'm sure one reason Intuit is letting quality drop is the price competition from the convicted monopolist.

My suggestion is to use a tax preparer."
Parallels give me a great interface to the windows based software I need to use on my MAC. It is great!
working. Let us see how long it sustains
"Seriously, the best thing about Avast in not that it's free. I've been using Avast! free on all my computers since 2007 with never a slowdown or hiccup. They've started marketing upgrades a little more aggressively of late, but nothing like the full on scare tactics and fake DoS attacks I've seen from their competitors. In any event the attempts to get you to upgrade are mildly distracting, but such a small concession for such reliable, secure and free antivirus service. Virus definition updates are timely, smooth (ie is not a resource hog) and thorough. In the 9 years I've been using Avast free maybe a handful of PUPs and low level malware have gotten through, stuff that's easily zapped by Adw-Cleaner. Occasionally I've had to run boot-time scans -- the interface for which is a little clunky -- in order to nail Root-kits after a new install on a used computer. But this is nothing out of the ordinary, especially on machines using other anti-virus programs, expired or otherwise. Anyway, thank you! to the Avast team for close to a decade of safe internet use."
excellent
"Unlike the earlier releases of Quicken I have used in the past, it is impossible to permanently minimize the ""Transaction Downloads/Deposits & Payments Reminders"" window that takes up the lower 1/3 of the screen whenever I open a linkable account in the transaction register.  I choose not to link any of my accounts online and find it extremely annoying to be forced to manually minimize this window.  I will continue to use Quicken to track all of my income and expenditures, but I am not happy about the way this new release has eliminated control over what I view in the transaction register for these accounts."
I upgraded from platinum 7. Now I can use all my projects on my windows vista and 7. It was well worth it!
"Installation quick and easy onto my Macbook Pro for this non-techie.  It was an online download, not a disk.  Works fine on the Macbook Pro."
Have been using this for several years now. It would be great if they allowed the multiple devices to be both PC's and MACs so you can install on either system since I have some of each.
"I hate the Quicken products.  This has become a necessary evil, and thorn in my side, since Microsoft sunsetted their Money product - which I absolutely loved.  Years ago I tried the Quicken and Money products side-by-side and the Money product was far superior.  There are a number of irritations that come to mind with Quicken, but a couple of outstanding annoyances are: when you are entering the name of the payee it puts a window of ""remembered"" payees up in front of where you are typing and you can no longer see what you are typing, and this version doesn't remember payees I have used often, but yet it remembers a Memo field that I only used once and NEVER forgets it again (I have to delete it everytime!).  Another thing I hate about Quicken products is that everytime they come out with a new version they are relentless on trying to get you to upgrade!  Every single time I open the program I am greeted with an advertisement box for the new version - and every time I uncheck the little box that says ""Remind Me Later"", but every time I open it, it reminds me again!  I loved Money, I could pay all my bills directly from the program through multiple institutions - for a much smaller fee than what Quicken wants to charge me."
"Misclassifications of building construction, chapters ending in the middle of sentences (chapter 10), grammatical erors and more. You can make the choice to spend the money. Editing is terrible."
Great software for the money.  Excellent features.  Fairly easy to use.  I got the download version so it was available almost instantly to use.  This software will take your photos to the next level.
love it
This screen saver wouldn't work on my computer because the note said I had a drive missing that the program needed.  I would like a refund please.
A good product that keeps getting better.
"I bought Iwork 08 from amazon and was cheaper than mac store and it was exactly the same product.
That was good for me."
"OMG fantastically easy to learn and use.  It has so many add-ins, that it's so easy to populate.  I think the only thing that it can improve the product is having create items requested by users."
"If you have taken or considering taking the plunge to migrate from a pc to mac.  beware!  Intuit has NOT put in the attention to its products for mac.  Data transfer is hit or miss, but the user interface is old, frustrating and three steps back from its windows component.  I had to keep my pc to run the business instead of migrating to all.  Waste of money."
Awesome money management tool. Works exactly how how I expected it should. Mobile app makes it even better. Buy it.
"I did some online research about virus protection programs and this one was consistently rated highly. I wanted something I could download from the computer, as opposed to waiting for something to arrive by mail. Fortunately, Amazon has this option.

In reading some of the reviews about downloads from Amazon, many we're complaining that they had a hard time finding out how to actually download it after making the purchase. I didn't have that problem at all. Rather, after I clicked 'buy,' I received a pop-up that took me directly to the Kaspersky site. It downloaded it directly, without me having to go to the site on my own. I did need to have the access code, but it was easy to cut-and-paste from the Amazon site.

From the time of purchase to the point where the program was downloaded took less than 10 minutes. Once it was downloaded, I had to register with Kaspersky, but that was fairly straight-forward. Just make sure to uncheck all the boxes along the way  unless you want constant alerts, offers, and annoyances.

Now does it work? That's where we, as consumers have to use blind faith. It's like taking vitamins; you just hope it does what it is supposed to."
"A very well taught subject.  Amy-Jill keeps my attention.  Surprised it is this ""dated"" product, but what difference does that make, the Bible has not changed."
"I thought this would be a lot easier to use, it is not, as with all photo editing there is some difficulty but this one is very hard to figure out!!.
 I should of stuck with Adobe Photo shop!!"
"I AM trying to return a package I got by mistake, I need this , but I need the deluxe suite. I need to know how to send back the one I have and exchange it for the deluxe suite."
"So glad I found out about this download.  It is better than carrying around books.  I read a lot and with the Kindle for PC, I read an average of 2 books a week.  Great for my commute."
"First of all, I have made many purchases through Amazon and they are the absolute leader on online sales! They have great customer service and their products come in a neat and timely manner. When I can't see the product in front of me before I purchase it, this is essential for an online environment! The MS Office for Mac that I purchased came in neat packaging. It was also exactly what I ordered and I use it everyday for school. It is a great tool! While Apple's iWork software is great and all, the Office for Mac Suite simply goes above and beyond when it comes to extra tools and optimization. It's definitely what separates the A's from the B's in college! Thank you Amazon for offering this amazing product!"
"Final Update - On February 1, 2011, I went to the Autodesk website to check for additional updates and found that FreeStyle had been withdrawn from sale.  Customer support stopped April 1, 2011.

Update 10/7/2010 - The first product update was released a couple of weeks ago. The major change fixes the first item below...you can now create custom symbols and store them in the library.  I'm still in the process of evaluating the release and will update this note after I've used it a bit more.

Original Review:
The designers of a package like AutoCAD FreeStyle face a classic challenge: It needs to be easy to use for a novice, with enough features to be useful, yet not so powerful that it will cannibalize sales of the high-end (and much more expensive) AutoCAD systems.  After spending a couple of days using AutoCAD FreeStyle, I think the designers set the bar way too low.  The interface is simple and easy to learn, but far too many features are missing for FreeStyle to be a competitive program.  That's not to say that FreeStyle can't be used to produce usable drawings; it just could be much better if it included basic features that are in other systems.  Let me go through some of the areas that stood out...

Symbol Library - A library is a collection of symbols that are created once and then used on multiple drawings.  FreeStyle comes with a collection of prebuilt symbols that are sufficient to get started, however it's not a complete enough library for a lot of projects - when I attempted to draw my sprinkler system, I discovered that there are no sprinkler components listed.  In most CAD systems, this problem is addressed by allowing the user to build custom symbols.  Once they're added to the library, they can be repeatedly used in future drawings.  This release of FreeStyle doesn't have that capability.  The symbols that come with the program are all that you've got, and that simply isn't enough.  Incidentally, what's in the library is even a little strange... the Electrical Symbols tab includes five Gas and Water symbols along with the basic electrical symbols and the Building Components section only contains six fireplace facades...I'm sure that in real life there are more building components than just those.

Paper Size and Scale - When you start a new drawing, the program asks you to select the size of the paper and the object that you' re going to draw.  e.g. you pick 8.5 x 11"" paper and select that the page represents a 30' x 40' space.  The scale shows that "" equals 1'.  This makes perfect sense to anybody not used to using a CAD program, but is backwards from the norm...normally a designer would select a paper size and a scale.

Splines - Splines are a way of smoothly connecting a series of points.  By adjusting the ""handles"", you can easily draw complex curves.  FreeStyle doesn't have a way of drawing with splines.  The menu allows you to draw with arc segments, straight lines and freehand ""doodles"".  You can adjust the points of inflection on the doodle and eventually get to the desired curve, but it's not as easy as it seems.  True spline capability would be easier.

Radius line joins - When drawing a floor plan, most lines meet with a sharp corner, but that's not always the case.  Sometimes a drawing needs to have a rounded curve joining the two lines.  Most 2-D drafting systems can do that automatically, but FreeStyle lacks that capability.  You can manually accomplish the same thing by drawing a small arc, but why?  You're only talking about a millisecond of computer time to have the program do it for you.

Double lines for walls - Often walls in architectural drawings are shown by two parallel lines, representing the inside and outside surfaces.  Freestyle doesn't have that ability built-in.  To do it correctly, it's a little more complicated that just having a double line as a selectable line type....you need to specify wall thickness, join corners correctly and scale appropriately as the drawing size changes.  Again, all this can be done manually, but the basic idea is to have the program save time by doing the work for you.  Incidentally, the work around is to simply draw a thick solid line for walls...look at all the sample drawings for examples.

Draw a wall of a house.  Now drag a window or door from the symbol library and place it onto the wall.  You'd think that the wall would break and allow the object to be inserted.  It doesn't.  OK, now manually break the wall into two separate line segments and drag the line ends apart to create the necessary break.  That would work, if there was a way to break a line into two pieces, but there isn't.  So you nuke the whole side of the house and redraw two separate line segments on either side of the door.  That works...until you realize that the door is 6"" to the left of where it should be.

The algorithm that calculates color fills is flaky.  When you drag the fill icon over a fillable area, the area is highlighted with a light version of the fill color. It's a nice idea, so you can see exactly where the color's going.  Unfortunately, a single open pixel prevents an area from filling.  The highlighting, though, isn't nearly so discerning.  It's not unusual to have an area highlight, but fail to fill when clicking on the mouse button.  I also managed to fill in an object and then select the color and move it while leaving the outline behind...it was a little strange.

There's no instruction manual.  You can get help for any of the commands by selecting that command and clicking the question mark icon.  Clicking on the icon showing three stacked baby letter blocks takes you to the Freestyle website where there is more detailed information.  It's annoying, though, not to have something you can skim through.  I was trying to figure out how to color in a tree and it wasn't until I saw a picture in the on-line help that I realized that the color was coming from a filled in circle located behind the tree.

I could add more, but you get the idea.  If the product manager at AutoDesk chooses, all of these can (and should) be fixed in a future release.  Until then, though, I'm only giving FreeStyle two stars.  The simple user interface is right on the mark for a non-technical consumer level product.  The omitted features, though, cost it dearly in the ability to produce usable and functional drawings."
I did have some problems with the earlier versions mainly in the spyware scanning and cleaning area. The latest version seems to improve a lot in this particular area. I did not notice any of the uninstallation and performance issues reported by others since I have a fast PC with no other AV software installed.

"I had purchased an earlier version of this Dragon several years ago. Even after spending a lot of time trying to train the program, I found that it did not work well enough to be usable. But I decided to take the plunge again, and I am happy that I did. Speaking Naturally 10 is impressive. With a minimal amount of setup, the program does a great job at accurately capturing what I say. Sure, it makes a few errors on more unusual words, but they have made the correction process so easy that fixing the mistake hardly takes any effort at all.

I find that I use it for creating rough drafts, and then go back to edit them the old fashioned way. The program has an excellent capability for editing, and I can certainly see that if typing were not possible (for health or some other reason), I could learn to do the entire job without a keyboard. But right now the hybrid approach seems to work best for me. However, I have a feeling that, over time, I will use voice editing more and more, and go to the keyboard less and less.

I was quite impressed with the program's ability to handle long phrases, and complete sentences. So you can dictate in a way that is most comfortable for you. If you decide you don't like what you just said, you simply say ""Scratch That"" and you get to say it again. This is a lot easier than deleting whole sentences with the keyboard or mouse after you decide to put the phrase a different way. If you want to search the document for a certain word - for example: Amazon, you simply say: Select Amazon and you find yourself with the word Amazon selected. I found this much easier that using the Edit Find commands.

You can also use voice commands to interact with the application. I spent a little time trying to use it to navigate around a web site, and found it more cumbersome that using the keyboard. But again, if circumstances are such that a keyboard is not feasible, then I believe the voice command approach would also be workable with a little practice.

Another cool thing is how the dictation works even in the presence of background noise. I have a noisy airconditioner right behind my desk, and yet I do not notice any degradation in the recognition quality when the air conditioner is turned on.

If you have ever been intrigued with voice recognition, now is the time to jump in and give this program a try."
"I will not purchase next year.  Last year I purchased and it worked well.  This year, the software offered to transfer information from last year's files.  It located last year's file, but crashed whenever I tried to transfer the data.  Now, I have to enter all of my personal information from scratch.  SUCKS!"
I have not yet used it. Amazon.com was a good choice for purchasing this software. It will be a very useful tool.
"Using Turbo Tax is the fastest, easiest and cheapest way to fill out and file you taxes. We have been using Turbo Tax for a long time now and we have never had any issues with the software. We would recommend this product."
"I have been using TurboTax for the past several years and have
been consistently pleased with this product.  It's user-friendly
and always leads to accurate returns.  And the price at Amazon
was good.  Highly recommended."
I got this book for free but it turned out that it had a few things in there that I never knew. Being an IT pro this book was a good refresher!
"MINUS 5. THERE IS NO MANUAL, HORRIFY EXPERIENCE. Fire the programmer. All I wanted was a simple way to track expenses. Old fashion accounting with paper and pencil is easier and less time consuming than this poorly designed program. A pencil allows mistakes to be deleted (erased). FOREVER. Not so with Quicken 2016. There is no true delete  I didn't like payee names that were downloaded from my bank. I wanted to simplify the names. Not so simple. First do the download. Then memorize. Then create new name and tell quicken what to look for so it will change future downloads. ONE LINE AT A TIME because Quicken won't allow multiple line changes. I spent hours making one line changes only to discover that Quicken duped every change. The original and my changes. And changed the amount on a few lines. NOT all lines just here and there. OK start over from scratch. Delete everything all accounts all files everything. NOPE. Uninstall program. NOPE. Can't do that either. This thing brings back all those deleted changes and dupes. I give up."
it is great.
"If I was only rating this product in terms of its versatility, intuitiveness and overall quality, it would score a perfect 5 for sure.

But then, if I rated it based only on customer service, it would earn a 1, and even then, I would prefer to give it a zero.

It is infuriating and inexcusable that the activation key expires so quickly, and that one must pay such an absurdly hefty fee for a new one.

I used CBC 2.0 happily for several months and endorsed it readily, but no more. I will have to find some alternative software, and in the meantime, I will advise everyone to steer clear."
"This program is disappointing!  It takes sometime to get use to the often complicated programmer techniques used to accomplish otherwise simple tasks.  However the most disappointing part are the tasks you can't accomplish.  There are other programs out there that cost less but I spent the extra to purchase this to get more.  The way Chief Architect limits the functionality is very frustrating.  One example is in the layout of anything involving cabinets.  You can put in the cabinets with a little practice but if you want to add a counter top that will cost you $200 for the professional upgrade.  I can't imagine a home user wanting to design a kitchen without countertops.  If I had to do it again, I would avoid this product."
Like it
good deal
It is okay.  It helps with typing speed and accuracy but I would need more functionality with different types of capitalization etc for it to be an excellent product.
Great product.
"Bought this for my 11 y.o. with writing issues. He enjoys using this to dictate assignments for school. It took some time and practice to ""train"" dragon to his voice but not it works well. I only wish we could put it on both laptops and the PC so he could use any computer that was handy at home. You can save more than one profile on the software though, so more than one person can use it without messing up the prediction rate for the other user."
"I needed this software for work following an arm injury. Unfortunately, it has caused so many more frustrations from basic use then just attempting to type with one hand. The free voice recognition software on my phone works 500 times better. Sometimes I cannot believe how wrong it hears the words that I am saying, and going back to revise everything is incredibly time-consuming. Additionally, it has strange little pop-ups that get in the way of text that I am trying to read or click on. As it is, I am now just sticking to my phone, and emailing text to my work computer so that I don't have to use this software."
received ok
Awesome product.  Great for small businesses.
"I own the 2000 CD version of 'My Mailist & Address Book'. My newer computer does not 'like' this older version.  I paid with a cc and downloaded the newer version.
It downloaded and I received a email w my password to use it.  The password did not work.  Every attempt to get help from Avanquest has turned out to be a round robin and futile. I would not give Avanquest any stars on either responding to customers refund request or to customes ability to reach any service HELP from them.  I spent the better part of two days online with them trying to get my download code to work, to allow me to use the program I had paid for and downloaded.  THE CODES THEY SENT DID NOT WORK. The phone numbers lead you in circles.  The online refund system does not work. THEIR DOWNLOADED PROGRAM SHOULD COME WITH A WARNING, IF YOU NEED ANY SERVICE YOU WILL NOT GET IT.  My recommendation is beware."
"While Quickbooks is a great system, We had some problems connecting with Point of sale. Several things had to be done manually."
"I have been a long time Zone Alarm Pro user.  Advocated it for all my friends, but the latest version was problematic.  Our kids PC keeps getting infected despite using a non Admin/non Power User account for him and requiring a password to confirm changes in Zone Alarm.  So after my own notebook started to head south a month ago in terms of responsiveness I decided to load the TIS Pro 2008 trial.  I have been very happy.

I like the update process, it is better than Zone Alarm's method.  I like the scanning, it doesn't use up the entire CPU.  I am still trying to figure out the best way to setup my MFCs.  The Belkin Network USB works with it once I added it's utility to the list of allowed and opened the correct ports.  It hosts a Epson MFC (9400-Fax) which works flawlessly. I am still trying to figure out (not very much time spent) on getting my Brother MFC-5840CN to scan across the network to this machine.  Printing works fine to it.  Just a matter I believe of doing the same thing as I did for the hub/epson by adding the correct programs (there are 5 I believe that machine uses) and ports to the allowed programs/ports lists.  Although I miss the program style control of Zone Alarm Pro, I think I like the TIS Pro model better.

Our kids notebook is crawling again (it has Zone Alarm Pro on it), I suspect once again it has been infected.  Looks like we will be using the recovery disk on that PC then loading TIS Pro 08 onto it.  My trial expires in four days, and I am buying this today.  I still have over a 100 days before my Zone Alarm subscription runs out.  I wish I had put the trial on the kids PC as well, but then I might not have had such an obvious way to compare the two.  I also wish I had found this before I renewed my Zone Alarm Pro subscription last spring."
Product key was already used.
Ordered 2014 Kaspersky Internet security and the software worked perfectly. Only had to enter the codes since I was updating from 2013 software. Saved lots of money as compared to buying directly from Kaspersky. Arrived within two days of ordering.
Huge learning curve.
"I recently recieved this in the mail from Amazon.com. Not only was the package torn up (I know it was sent from another company and not Amazon, so I don't blame them entirely) but the software wouldn't work on my computer! I tried to install it over and over but apparently the software isn't suitable for some components of Windows XP. I am really disappointed, especially since I was so excited to try this."
"The idea of a program completely on the computer was appealing to me as a first time home-schooling mom.  I bought this curriculum (2008 curriculum) for both my 7th and 8th graders.  We all found the program very constrictive and quite honestly, just plain irritating!  We struggled with having the right concept, sometime even answering with synonyms and the computer still telling us the answer was wrong.  In a few cases more than one word is acceptable but if you are not on track with their line of thinking - you can be close but not close enough.  I would have to use the parent password to figure out what EXACT answer was needed.  I do mean EXACT - spelling, plural/non-plural, no synonyms, spell the number or numeric...I agree that in certain subjects spelling should be correct but sometimes learning a new concept you just need to get the concept and grasp the spelling later - even partial credit would be nice -but not with SOS. There was way more hands on involvement than I expected - I would have rather used paper/pencil workbooks like by 2nd and 3rd graders used.  After paying 600 dollars for both grades we struggled through but I definitely will not buy this curriculum again."
I can only speak for myself. My win 10 laptop win 7 desktop and android phone this app does not work at all. The older app was fantastic for me. This is junk till Amazon decides to fix it.
This product is no longer sold and has been superseded by other products but Amazon wants me to write a review so I will say that I was happy with it when I used it and still sometimes use the smart erase feature.
We have been using Trend Micro products for years now and we have never had a virus on any of our computers.
"Just make sure you use the software from the website and not the CD. Another commenter mentioned this, and they were right. Using the website software on a mac mini hooked to a dell LCD resulted in a remarkably better picture after calibration. I love using my computer again! no more weird orange tint! easy to follow instructions! mac friendly! I am telling all my friends and co-workers. One of the best computer product purchases I have ever made. I'd give it 6 stars if I could."
"I hate it...it is so non user friendly and microwsoft won't answer question, refund or help."
"Second year using H&R block - I will never go back to TurboTax.  Do wish the questions were laid out better, some can be ambiguous.  Had to make a few manual entries to correct final audit problems, which should have been addressed in the base questions.  I also find the donation entry function to be cumbersome to use, and can't be edited.  Good overall, and will use again next year."
"I have been using Avast! on my PC, laptop, tablet and phones since around 5 years. Sometimes I did deviate towards others antivirus when in trouble, only Avast! worked. A whole-hearted recommendation!!"
Met my expectations
arrived as ordered...happy
"I don't like big security suites like Norton because I think they use too much resource and slow down your computer in the back ground.  I usually uninstall them when I buy a new computer and install a free software like this one.  I used to use AVG, but they are getting bloated too.  Avast still maintains a small foot print and does not add much to boot time.  interface is pleasant too."
"Easy to use, good for a small business."
does what it should
"I buy Encarta every year, and Britannica from time to time. This is my opinion:
TEXT: Britannica's writing style is more sophisticated, and its authors are very well known.  However, Encarta is not bad written at all, its authors are good and the contents are more or less the same, or better in the last versions.
You can update Britannica over the Internet free for a year, but only quarterly (4 times).  Encarta is updated EVERY WEEK with new articles and additions to the old ones.
MULTIMEDIA and FEATURES:  Encarta devastates Britannica with a lot of animations, interactivities, videos, music and sounds, pictures, literature sidebars, new translation dictionaries, Atlas, 2 D and 3 D virtual tours, timeline, games ...  It's not only the quantity and quality. It is the easy access you have to all the multimedia, and that text, multimedia and features are completely integrated.
NAVIGATING:  Encarta wins again. You only have to type a phrase, a word or de beginning of a word to see all the articles and multimedia that contains it.  If you have typed the name of a small village lost in Senegal (e.g.), you see it in the Atlas without clicking again.  If Encarta does not find anything, it gives you alternative spellings and you meet with what was looking for.  To go ""jumping"" from article to article is very easy and quick, because you have a lot of links and the ""Related Articles"" section.  If you need to copy text or pictures, the integration with Microsoft's WORD is perfect.
Navigating with Britannica is different. You do not get crazy, but ...  I only say that, if you do not know the exact and correct spelling of a name or word, it does not help you with alternative or similar spellings.
My computer is Pentium III 1000 Mhz 256 RAM, and I have copied Britannica into the hard drive (the same with Encarta). The fact is that it is very slow, and that takes a lot of RAM (50 % more or less).  If you have other programs open, perhaps Britannica does not work.  With Encarta, you do not have any problem.
I hope my opinion is helpful for you."
"Best value for PC protection.  If installed/renewed before expiration, you will lose the remaining days of protection.  Once installed, the software reset to 365 days to renew.  Use Mcaffee in the past.  Norton is trouble free."
"This is my second Hallmark Card Studio.
The good points: you can easily take their pre-made card and change the fonts - color, style, & size - or make one of your own from scratch. Most of the time you can change the headings like for Aunt rather Grandmother. You can add your own photos. If you like the verse but not the illustrations, erase it and put your own. It has an Event Planner Calendar to put reminders, an address base that prompts birthdays and anniversaries on the Event Planner, and that merges with sending out multiple copies of cards like for Christmas.
The cons: I think the artists must have been out of the United States. It has ONE African-American person, and that's a cartoon but 7 African people. Middle East - 8 cartoons, Irish - only shamrocks. British - 3 pictures with stones. Priest - 3 cartoons - one of them is a frog! Wedding - none in current styles - and about half of them are mice! Wedding dress - no beautiful flowing gowns.
While it says it has thousands of images, many look like they were drawn in seconds.
If you like their pre-made card styles and just want to add your own verse - it's quick and easy to use, the results good. If you want pretty, natural looking, detailed clip-art - there is probably a better program."
"Like another reviewer here, I received the box but there is no serial number anywhere to be found. Looking on forums, there should be some type of 8 page quick start guide that has it. There is no such guide. Very frustrating."
"As a beta tester for Quicken 2011 I've had a couple months to really dive into the features of Quicken Deluxe 2011 and have been using it as my primary Personal Finance Software. The last version of Quicken I used was Quicken Deluxe 2008 after upgrading yearly since 2005. Prior to that I was a MS Money users since Money 97, upgrading every other version.
When I switched from Money to Quicken I felt that I gave up some nice user experiences and fluidity of the application. Money was getting a little too friendly with butterflies and cartoony icons. Quicken on the other hand felt very old school, pretty rigid and sorta ugly. But I felt it was more robust and learned to work in the clunkier UI.
Quicken 2011 has gone a long way toward improving the user experience while maintaining the robust feature set. The influence of the Mint team is immediate obvious on the default home page with a drill-down spending pie chart that is taken directly form the Mint site. This is a good feature for quickly seeing where your money has gone. The ability to click down into sub-categories and then payees is very nice. It's also helpful to catch if you've miscategorized a transaction. Below that on the home screen is the upcoming bills/reminders so you have a clear view (after entering the reminders) of where your money is going to go. You can enter/skip this bills from that home page without going to another screen or register. At the bottom of the home page is a customizable spending tracker. I took advantage of the customization and removed this completely.
These home page features and their logical, easy links to Spending and Bills tabs lay out a good workflow for managing your day-to-day finances. Unfortunately, as you move further across the tabs you get to the Planning tab with the Spending Planner, Lifetime Planner and Tax Center. The latter two don't appear to have been touched since the 2008 versions but the Spending Planner is promoted from the My Savings Plan to front and center for planning purposes. I cannot figure out how this is supposed to work and be better than the budget tool in Quicken. And many beta testers had this same experience. The Spending Planner really falls short of being useful and I ignore it completely. Intuit could really benefit its users by including some video tutorials about how this feature is supposed to work and the philosophy behind it (the Help files are as cryptic as the feature). Ultimately, I would prefer that Quicken have it's budget feature better integrated to the Planning tab and not contained in a separate modal box. The budget tool appears to not have been updated since I started using Quicken in 2005 - and it is really one of the key tools I use consistently.
Overall, the at-a-glance and easy drill down of the home page, Spending and Bills tab make for a good upgrade from downlevel versions. If you are using Quicken 2010 you may not see real compelling need to upgrade, but for 2008 and earlier users, this is an upgrade you should really consider."

"I have used Family Tree software before and found many problems with it. So when I started back doing genealogy I did my research. I liked Root Magic  I was able to try it on trial first which I liked very much and I liked the reviews I read. I was so impressed that I bought the whole version. One feature I wish they would include and that is on making charts I find that the divorce (div)does not show up on the charts which I miss from having it on other program. It is a feature that is important in a family tree.  Maybe it is my fault it might be available but I haven't figured it out yet. But other then that I love Root Magic software 6....You can't go wrong try the trial first and see for yourself. Very easy for a beginner to use.

"I bought it meanly because the resume caster function can distribute your resume through the Internet.
After I spend a lot of time to manually input every thing (Because their auto import of the WORD file made a mess!), I found out that the resume caster is not working at all!"
Wonderful. Convenient. Practical. Well done
"I used TurboTax for many years, but last year they surprised me with a $35.90 fee to e-file one federal and one state return. $35.90 just to e-file is ridiculous. So I thought I'd try Taxcut. But in looking at their software, they say the package includes federal and state returns, and includes 5 federal e-files. What's with that - most people want a single federal and a single state return, and they don't say anywhere what they'll charge to e-file the state return. Does Taxcut also employ the ""surprise 'em with a high e-file fee"" after they buy the product? The non-disclosure is maddening."
great
"My mama always said, ""if it aint broke, don't fix it.""  That was never more true than with this software.  This software (and system works) fixes ""problems"" that aren't even there, and causes there to be major conflicts with other software.  It's so bad, there was a MAJOR conflict with this program a Norton Anti-Virus 2000, that made the Anti-virus software just not respond, ever.  Then the computer would always go to the ""blue screen of death"" each time I booted Windows ME.  Once I uninstalled Utilities, there were no more problems.
I spoke with some rechs at Dell, (the place where I purchased my computer), and they said Utilities does that alot, and that unless you know EXACTLY what you are doing, stay away"
"This game proved key to reviving a series several feared was staggering. Through innovative new concepts, such as the addition of the Hardy Boys and confining Miss Drew to a train for the duration of her sleuthing, even fans growing weary of the series will quickly fall in love.

Perhaps most pleasant about the game was the delightful variety amongst the characters and their personalities. This game, by far, introduced the most widespread array of personalities I've seen in the series.

I felt the game ended a bit too quickly, not in a sense of ease, but rather in the sense that I desired to continue playing! After this game I am very eagerly awaiting the release of the next game in the series ""Danger By Design."""
"Once you've gone through all of the pain of gathering up records (that you should have kept organized all year), it's nice to sit down with a program like TurboTax that will guide you through the rest of the process.  It's comforting to know that all of the changes in the IRS laws and rules have been taken into account, so all you have to do is follow your guide through the maze.  At the end, it will e-file for you and you're done.  Easy."
Thank you for all who took the time to inform of the inadequacy of this product for many filers.  Glad to see that people are taking their business elsewhere.  I too was a loyal TURBOTAX user for over 10 years. GOODBYE turbotax.
works well...great itea
It got here in a timely manner
Outstanding software seemlessly linked to fidelity. Downloaded and filed state return to accompany federal. Smoothly E filed both returns.
I was a bit disapointed due to the fact that you had to pay extra for state taxes to get processed and if you owned property they wanted you to upgrade to the deluxe.  Otherwise ok
"Very powerful tool with lots of capability.  I'm experienced with other video editing software and was able to start a new project fairly easily; however, it may take a little time to fully understand how to use all the tools.  I couldn't get the video capture tool to work and setting up the root menu for DVD creation was not intuitive.  That said, I was able to create a very professional presentation."

"I first saw ""Anime Studio Debut"" last summer at the Comic-Con convention in San Diego. I was impressed with it then because it looked so easy-to-use and actually had it in mind as a Christmas present for my now-9 y.o. when Amazon offered it to me in Vine. We have really enjoyed playing around with it and my DD has done some great little cartoons. The one thing we have not been able to figure out is how to upload the completed animations to my Facebook page. The user is supposed to be able to do it directly from the program but that isn't working for us."
Wonderful to use during the summer for children of any age.  The levels keep the child learning more and more each day.
"I was moments away from purchasing this at a retail store even though the only feature I really wanted was the ability to burn HD-format video onto a standard DVD (obviously with less time per disc due to the much smaller storage size). This was the number-one touted feature on the box (and on the Amazon website). I didn't have my reading glasses with me and almost missed the itty-bitty 2-point type down at the bottom that said that this feature was only available with a separate purchase of a special plug-in only available from Roxio. What the crud? This is SOFTWARE, not a mechanical device... if the software doesn't support the feature it advertises, then IT""S NOT A FEATURE... the plug-in is a separate software product and they should not be able to advertise it as part of the parent application! This is one of the most misleading cheats I've ever seen. At least on the web-site they don't hide it in 2-point type, you just have to follow the asterisks. If it's still worth it to you, and you don't mind rewarding deceptive marketing practices, the plug-in is available at the Roxio web site for twenty bucks extra. Let me know how it works, cuz' I ain't buying it."
"Won't dowload and the instructions are lacking. I'm getting a refund. ""Navagative to vitural directory"" without anymore instructions isn't sufficent."
"It's not bad software.  I guess it depends on what you use it for.  Personally, I only use it as a check register to reconcile my spending, although I do like to see some of the reports and gauge where my money is spent.  I don't need to download transactions or pay bills online so I haven't had any of the problems other reviewers are reporting.  I will say it converted my files from Quicken Essentials over without an issue.  Overall, it does what I need it to and I'm not going to complain."
"As a user of Quickbooks 2007 and 2009 after it, I was looking forward to trying out the latest and greatest version to resolve some nagging issues that I had with the 2009 version (some of which were carry-overs from 2007 that I figured would be fixed in 2009) and gain much-needed compatibility with Windows 7.

Most importantly, I wanted to have complete compatibility with Windows 7 (64 bit). While QB2009 worked for the most part, it was not able to generate PDF files and it was a little fussy about applying updates without running in Administrator mode. Generating PDF's is how I generate invoices and send them out by E-Mail, so this is an important feature for me.

On that point, I was very happy when QB2010 installed on both Windows 7 RC and the release version successfully. Unfortunately, a subsequent update caused PDF generation to fail. This update (R5) was done by Intuit on December 29, 2009, and nearly 3 months later, it has not been fixed. Fortunately, there is documentation in Intuit's support site about a workaround that is successful.

For them to break functionality and then not fix it after more than two months is inappropriate, and it calls into question what they might break in future revision updates. I will definitely think twice when any new updates are flagged and check around before applying them.

Aside from that, how does Quickbooks 2010 work?

Sadly, some nagging interface issues have existed in Quickbooks since at least the 2007 version and the company shows no sign of improving them.

For example, the process of entering billable time is very clunky. The fields do not default to a preset value, or even the last value entered. For a sole proprietor, there is never a need to enter a different person for whom time record applies. Rather than default to the only employee name present in the Employees list, the drop-down insists on looking through all of the ""Other Names"" for possible matches. My name is listed above the ""other names"" but as I type, it ignores my name at the top of the list and shows the first match to the letters typed until enough of my name has been typed to exclude all other possibilities. A small issue, sure, but aggravating nonetheless.

As a long-time Quicken user, my first impression of Quickbooks 2007 was that it was years behind Quicken 2006 in interface design. Dialogs look like they were designed when Windows 3.1 was all the rage. Being a business tool, I don't need or want animated clip art or unnecessary visual elements, but isn't it possible to introduce user interface elements that would make the dialogs more visually effective and maybe even a little more appealing?

In addition to a visual design that looks very dated, there are interface elements that are not suitably-sized for their contents. An example of this is in the ""Make Deposits"" dialog. The ""Deposit to"" drop-down box is so small that the names of the accounts do not fit. This makes it difficult to distinguish between accounts that may have similar beginnings with account numbers at the end. This forces me to change how I do things instead of the software adapting to my needs. The dialog has plenty of horizontal space, so expanding that field would not be a problem. The program is littered with examples like this, and I will not belabor the point by providing more examples.

The time it takes Quickbooks to start and load a company file got longer from 2009 to 2010 as well. I'm not able to time-test between them, but the startup time is excruciating (~30-45 seconds), and it prevents me from being able to pop into the program, do a little data entry and get back out again and return to other tasks.

Should a Quickbooks 2009 user upgrade?

At this point, I would say no. Unless you need a feature that was introduced in 2010. Since I received 2010 at the same time that Windows 7 was officially released, I don't have any experience running QB 2009 under the released version of Windows 7. It's possible that the PDF generation issues in 2009 can be fixed with the same workaround that is necessary for R5 release of 2010.

I have found no compelling features in 2010 that were not in 2009. Everyone uses this program differently, so what may be inconsequential to me may be vitally important to someone else. However, based on my usage needs, so little has changed between Quickbooks 2007 and 2010 that Intuit should be embarrassed to continue charging $150+ for each incremental upgrade they release each year.

That said, however, Quickbooks 2010 does serve my needs. I am now entrenched in the program far enough that I would not be interested in moving to a different tool unless there was a significant reason to do so. The time and effort that would take would need to be compensated by a large benefit in usability, features, and/or productivity in my workflow.

While I will check out the inevitable release of Quickbooks 2011 in the hopes that some of these issues will be addressed, they will need to impress me with what I see before I would shell out another $150 for a new version."
easy to use and navigate
"Great program, full of power for the creative. I have the old and new (7) and like them both. Either one will keep you busy."
"First off, i will be fair to say I did not purchase at Amazon, but got it from a membership store.  The worst part for me was deciding which one to buy and I wanted the one with the free ""State"" included free with it but I saw nothing big on box to state this like in the past but I found it.  Luckily, the store had it, but from what I read on Amazon, Amazon's was an added cost.  Maybe I just didn't see the one that included ""State"" on Amazon as I went by similar pricing instead of searching each one.  It was confusing and then once I bought it, I heard about forms that were missing on the Deluxe version and people had to upgrade and then Turbo Tax rectified it and well, it was a big mess for many.  Again i got lucky and did not need the forms that were missing.  This is why I gave it four stars as the Turbo Tax I purchased worked great for me but way too confusing buying it.  Turbo Tax needs to simplify the buyers experience as it has been.  I have been a Turbo Tax user since the early 90's and have relied on it.  Yes, updates need to happen and that is understandable, but don't take away that was once included and don't confuse consumers with product name changes.  if it ain't broke, don't fix it!"
It is not friendly user unfortunately. It is not the same way when you take pic f1.4 but heavy blurring which is hard to control to make it right adjustment.
I'm the kind of person that gets really uncomfortable learning a new skill from a qualified instructor without having any previous knowledge of said skill. I was really interested in learning the piano so I chose this product. I'm glad to say it is a great tool. Two of my family members who are pretty good on the piano are amazed at the progress I'm making. The software layout is great in giving you the ability to go at your own pace. It always you to continue working on problem areas while skipping those you excel at. The structure of the lessons is great and easy to understand. I recommend this product to anyone interested in learning piano or anyone who is shy about learning as I am.
"I wrote a review on this item, awhile back and I hoped it would of worked on my kenwood in dash garmin gps.
however it worked once in awhile, but never consistantly like the card I wanted to replace it with. it would load the maps one day, but the next day it would say loading maps for really a long time.
I do not remember giving it high or low review, a couple of weeks later. I get a email from the seller to ask me to remove the review, since it was too negative. I would of thought they would of tried to sell me a sd card that would of worked instead. I thought telling the truth is what reviews are for. and I come back and see my review removed, or I seem not able to find it. its a little strange. i never asked for my money back, since I might be able to use on another device, or give it to a family member's for them to use.  a little strange my review was deleted without my permission?

if your gps is compatible, my guess would be that this product would be good. just in my case, its not."
The software worked well once I got last year's info loaded into it.  I would have rated it higher if it wasn't for their horrible customer support.  I had problems loading last year's info into the app because my business partner did last year's taxes on his computer.  I talked to a support rep to find out how to deal with this.  It took forever for the rep to understand my problem and then the instructions she gave me were absolutely wrong.
"Here's the deal.  If you plan to make CDlabels that you will print just one time this is an ok way to get started.  The problem for me was I bought the first version of Professinoal CD Label kit by GlobalStar software.  I saved lots of CD lables for home moveis, Computer Install CD's etc.

Two major problems with the product:  first, I could not import any of my old saved labels from the first version of the program.  Second, you must buy refill paper as this program generally only works with the size of paper that ships in the kit which locks you into that and greatly limits where you can buy refill paper.  I tried creating a custom ofset to make the program work with lables other than what it shipped with.  It worked only some of the time and wasted hours doing it.

Also, you move the paper guides on your printer to fit these labels.  When you use ordinary full sized labels They are the standard 8-1/2x11"".

A much better way to go is buy a program that handles any paper then you can use just about any labels.  Staples generic ... no problem, avery, no problem.  The best program I found after many hours of searching is called: Acoustica CD DVD Label Maker.  The program is compatible with at leat 50 brands of paper!  And they will add more if you ask.  This solves the problem of what to do when the paper runs out.  Remember, once you save your cd labls on your computr you are locked in to their program and an paper refils.  It's a nightmare!"
one word wonderful
excellent.
Excellent application.  Nice to be able to ready my books on my PC when I don't have my Kindle available.
Does what it's supposed to do.
I can't print from my laptop that is vista and when hitting on the link it doesn;t do anything. I need help to get this to work. i wouldn't recommend this.
Excellent internet security software. I am using it for last 4 years and faced no threat or virus ever. I usually buy multiple user product and use it for all my devices.
"I have been using this software for about a month and it is by far the best anti virus/maintenance software on the market for the money. It runs quietly in the background and performs all the tasks it says it supposed to and does not Hog your memory and slow your system. I highly recommend for anyone wanting a great value and professional All-In-one program to take acre of their PC. And best of all, it is made and supported in the USA."
I was very limited on the amount of typing that I could do because of physical problems. The program has given me a new leash on life and I am able to continue to work. Thank you for the great product.
"Definitely a change from 2003! I am taking an online Microsoft Word class for a degree requirement and I have learned all the new tricks to 2007 and I like the way it is set up and the way it runs. Have patience with it to learn it, and you will too!"
best learning tool for children
I love this product! I had to purchase it again because I lost my CD
"I'm a professional studio musician and composer in Los Angeles and have been using Sibelius for about 3 years.  For creating high quality, totally professional looking music and scores, Sibelius is the best.  I constantly have other pro musicians come up to me after seeing the charts I've done in this program, to tell me how incredible they look.  I've even had other copyists tell me they were going to bail on Finale when they've seen the results I get.  There have been many times where Sibelius's ability to create Graphics, including PDF's have saved me, and my clients thousands of dollars.  Now instead of printing 500 pages of backup copies for a show, I can give the client a CD with PDF's they can print from any computer, or e-mail anywhere in the world in a second."
"There is a lot wrong with this software. Online banking is all but impossible, even after downloading statements in the exact format required by the software. Importing... forget about it! So, I now have all of these lovely online data files on my desktop and QuickBooks can't/won't read them.

No worries, I'll just call the tech support line, since we have a free 30 days of support with purchase. Nope. The info at QuickBooks.com/callme lets us all know that support is not currently available for our product on our platform and we can't even fill out the form to get ""in line"" for a callback tomorrow, when tech support is available.

What's with all of the hoops we get to jump through, after spending nearly $200 on this software?

I was the office manager for a small business that used QuickBooks Pro on Windows back in '99. I was eager to try out QuickBooks for the Mac with the financial records of MY small business (which has recently become not-so-small, hence the need to automate, rather than doing everything ""by hand"" this fiscal year) and the whole experience has been a big fat downer.

I'm still giving the software two stars because I guess I figure the cute ledger sheets and invoice generators are somewhat more robust than Microsoft Excel.

*sigh*"
Works very well
"It works fine but very over pieced.  Need Premier for a few simple mutual funds and still have to pay extra to file with the state.
Feeling kind of used and abused."
Sold as advertised.
"I have used several different apps for image processing and editing. I have mastered none of them because you have to make it a career to get great results, in my opinion. I lose interest in things quickly so I needed an app that gave me quick results. NX2 does this for me and without having to read a manual. I found the interface a bit lacking at first because I was used to hunting for things in other apps. I soon realized why the developers created the interface the way the did. As you work with NX2, everything you need is right in front of you. No menus to navigate. I really appreciate that as my attention wans with nested menus.

I shoot RAW + JPG and process the NEFs. The best thing I found was the non-destructive approach NX2 uses. You can easily remove the changes to files by undoing them without damage to the original file. Kind of like meta data.

Over all, a great product."
Runs beautifully. It also brings back many childhood memories :)
Won't start up. No tech support. total waste of money!!
Mobile application needs a lot of work.  They are on their 6th release to this point. I have been a user for the last five years.
"This product feels like it was designed for a different era -- a time when people used to purchase encyclopedias on CD-ROM. I found the entire program cumbersome and annoying to use. In terms of content, I feel that there are free alternatives out there that will give you the same benefit. This product is not an introduction to the language, it is a tool for learning how to ask for the bathroom and how to order a beer. You'd be better off with a small book or an iOS application that performs the same function."
"I have used Quicken & Quickbooks products since the early 90's. I have purchased several add on products during that time.
Quicken & Quickbooks started out as great products but have declined greatly in the last few years. They also offer extra cost products on many of their ""upgrades"" which were included in earlier products for free.
Customer Manager is a different issue. I started out with version 1. Description on box seemed to offer a usefull product. However, the program was so limited that it made more work than it eliminated. Like a fool I bought V2 when it came out because the concept seemed good & many improvements were promised. I was wrong. It has more bugs, hardly any real improvements than V1. The feature for sending e-mails is worse than useless. It takes several steps to put it into history and often doesn't work at all. You can see from all the other reviews that there are lots of other issues as well. I have experienced them as well."
"The program itself is good, but I have to knock a BIG star off for how difficult it's been to load and use.  First, it doesn't work with the latest OS (El Capitan). I had to go through unbelievable hoops to roll back my OS to Yosemite to install this on my computer. (For the record, if you need Yosemite, Apple doesn't offer it anymore. You have to get it from someone on ebay.) I also discovered that most of my financial documents (from my credit cards and bank) can't be imported. So, so frustrating. Quickbooks desperately needs to improve its software for Mac."
Got to have it.
"I mostly use this for educational purposes, And i'm very pleased."
"High expectations! I bought this on a lightening deal as a second learning program for studying guitar. I have electric guitars. Used it exclusively for about a week and was actually a bit disappointed. It functioned OK on my windows 10 operating system but the program itself is tedious to use after a few lessons. The included music referenced is old and royalty free. The exercises do help you learn to switch between chords quickly. The education was just about playing chords and I didn't learn much more than that. Still, it was useful a bit. The fretboard was nice. The videos were easy to use. The topic discussions were OK. The thing is that I just don't want to use it anymore so I cannot get into the program deeper to determine if there is something truly redeeming in the app. There were links included to other websites with tabs and more popular songs and those were scary links. The first link I clicked on triggered my malware blocker so I didn't use the other links.

In summary: So my review does reflect that functionally it worked. It may be useful to someone learning but it didn't appeal to me much at all. Following the included links to popular music are not recommended. It needs a serious upgrade to include some popular music that people can relate to with tonal memories to help them learn rhythm. But I cannot recommend this software overall. If it helps, I am a 50 year old learning guitar for the first time. I actually prefer Rocksmith (PS4) and some apps on the ipad over this software. Don't usually like to reference other software in my reviews because it might make people think I represent the other supplier. In this case the other software was a verified amazon purchase that I will review separately. It might be useful for some people and it does work on my Windows 10 laptop. So 3 stars. I would not buy again though."
excellent
I've used Norton for years. I did get a virus once. I feel semi protected. Still not sure who's better: Norton or McAfee? I highly recommend purchase from amazon because this is the least expensive place to get it.
No complaints so far!
"I'm still getting used to the new interface of the Online Essentials after working from a computer-based software version for years.  I'm liking it, but there are problems with the emailed Invoices now getting caught in my clients' spam filters which was not a problem previously."
"Turbo tax deluxe did a perfect job for me. It did meet my expectation. If you have stocks, you can still use deluxe and you don't need to buy premium for a higher price. Turbo tax could have been more genuine with its customers, however, had they mentioned Deluxe as handling stocks in its description."
"Dazzle, it's namesake apart - disappoints.  The box clearly says that it works with Windows Vista.  The software installed with windows warning that there were compatibility issues with Pinnacle Systems software. The patches were installed and Studio 10 and Instant DVD recorder crashed (Windows blue screen)- service is non existant and their online forum and support is of no use.  I will be returning this to Amazon.

DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT UNTIL DAZZLE CORRECTS ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS."
"I have used SnagIt 8 for years at work and loved it.  So, it was a ""no-brainer"" to buy it for my home computer use when the time came.  SnagIt 11 works great on my home PC with Windows 8.1 and I would recommend it to anyone who wants an easy-to-use screen capture software."
Better than Microsoft Office and it doesn't cost a dime. All my Microsoft Office files were compatible.
"Awful software. Worked twice and no matter what set of directions I follow will not work on any of the 4K clips from my Sony HC. Free version of competitor's software is ling the work just fine, wish I could get a refund..."
"This warning is for users who already have Nero 6: The installation of Nero 7 ""Enhanced"" requires the complete removal of N6.  There is an automated uninstall tool that rears its ugly head when you initialize the N7 install process. THIS UNINSTALL PROCEDURE IS HIGHLY FLAWED AND CAN DAMAGE YOUR PC'S BOOT PROCESSES.

Here's what happened to me: Before inserting the N7 install CD, I created an Windows Restore point, then loaded the disc. The N7 installer found the pre-existing N6 files and stated that de-installation of all Nero components was required before N7 installation, so (BIG MISTAKE), I proceeded.  It un-installed all existing Nero components in sequence, then requested a reboot before N7 installation.

Upon reboot, XP could get as far as the desktop image and then locked up.  No applications loaded in the Systems Tray and the Start button was inoperable.  Subsequent reboot attempts also failed.

N7 comes with a flyer offering a measly 10-day free tech-support.  However, in my situation, this presented me with a nasty Catch-22: To call the line, you must first register a provided ""TSID number"" over the 'net.  Well, gee, I couldn't do that since my PC wouldn't boot, but I called anyway.  Of course, when the tech guy comes on the phone, he sounds totally surprised, like no one else has ever had this problem, but I demanded he assist anyway.

He gets off the phone, comes back on, and tells me to reboot into Safe Mode.  I try it, but I can't even get that far; it just hangs uncompleted, too.  He does the  off-on phone routine again, and inanely tells me to try it again.  However, I opt for the ""last known good config mode"" option on my own.  It works, and the Windows desktop successfully loads.

I hang up, go thru the Windows Restore process, and test the restored N6.  It seems to be functioning as it was prior to this debacle.  And that's where I'm getting off the bus on the Nero upgrade route.

In retrospect, perhaps I should have stopped the process  when N7 prompted the N6 de-install, and used the Windows Add/Remove tool to accomplish that task.

After reading this, if you're still crazy enough to attempt an N7 install, you should consider that option.  I'll never know, because my N7 package is going in the garbage: If they couldn't even get something as basic as the upgrade installation  procedure right, who knows what else, equally non-trivial & dangerous, lurks in the product after it's loaded?

I strongly suspect that competitive pressures between Nero and Roxio (whose own Media Creator 9 has also been widely vilified) are forcing releases of bug-laden, unthoroughly-tested versions of their mutual flagship products.  Unfortunately, this is the same principle that has left the Big Three Detroit automakers in their present precarious financial positions: They, too, fostered off R&D projects as finished products, that had to be continually repaired from the day they hit the road, on unsuspecting consumers for years and are now paying the price.

As the Big Three have discovered, and as Roxio & Nero probably will also soon experience, consumers have other places to go to get well-built/tested products.

BEWARE OF THIS PRODUCT AND AVOID IT LIKE YOU WOULD THE PLAGUE."
I upgraded from Studio 9 to this version only to find this version is not at all user friendly like Studio 9.  I upgraded because I thought it would help me incorporate newer video types but this one wouldn't open the files I needed either.  So basically I threw away $60 for a product I probably won't ever use again.  Back to a version that actually works and is easy to use.
"Disc did not work on MacBook Pro this year.  Called and they could not find a resolution so sent me a link to download the program.  I did so but found that the state program had not been included.  I purchased the state on line but it did not install (an updater did but without the program you just got an error message) yet I received 3 e-mails charging me $39.95 each (a different  confirmation code on each e-mail sent 5 minutes apart from each other).  I called about that matter and finally was told that the 2 additional charges would be refunded.  O.K., I did the fed program (thinking that the state program had finally installed) but when it came to doing the state program, I was again asked to pay for it.  I called again (3rd call by this time and went through the whole deal again).  It seems that they should have sent a different link that automatically inserts the state version into the overall program.  Finally got rolling and was able to do the state tax and eventually e-file both at the same time (required).  I spent a lot of phone waiting for service (x3 - had to switch phones as batteries lost charge) and did not always get helped in a technical sense, just politeness.  What do I mean?  Well when you repeatedly say, I am using a MacBook Pro, as I did the previous year, and you keep getting Microsoft solutions that is not profitable assistance.  I also had to spend time on 'Live Chat' as well as the 3 phone calls.  I think I spent more time in seeking resolutions to software problems than I did doing the taxes.  I may be getting a credit from H&R Block because of the problems that I have only partially elaborated upon here.  I certainly hope that things go better next year!"
"I have been a huge fan of QuickBooks since I first put an employer's books on them back in 1997 or so.  The only quirk was that it was just as cheap to buy the upgrade every year, as it was to purchase the ""payroll tax table updates"" from Intuit.

Apparently, with QuickBooks 2006, they have circumvented this necessity by requiring you to purchase a $199/year add-on if you want to process payroll through QuickBooks.  I called the Sales line, and the operator was quick to tell me that I could *manually* do the payroll by calculating FICA, SUTA, FUTA, Fed w/h, and state w/h separately, and then manually entering all these numbers into the paycheck and having QuickBooks print it.  I believe that this unnecessarily complicates the process -- especially for those business owners that may only have a few employees.

I am very disappointed with Intuit for making these changes.  I think that this greatly devalues their product.  I would give it 5 stars if you are not processing payroll, but NO stars for the payroll issue.

QuickBooks is still an excellent program if you are just trying to track A/R, A/P, etc. but if you intend on trying to process your own payroll, look somewhere else instead of spending your money on this program."
Awesome program. Can't wait to become a master of it.... Thanks guys!
"I have played many tycoon games and some are more difficult than others. However, TV Tycoon has absolutely no chance of winning. The setting is 1954, that is fine, except you begin with a Bank loan of 24,000,000 at an interest RATE of 20% per DAY (yes, that's correct)!!! In the beginning you can only make about 1-2 million a day which barely cover the 1 million dollar a day rental expense for the TV station.. by the time you are making any kind of income, the bank loan has compounded to over 60 million dollars, that would be 12 million a day interest, and at the end of 15 days you will owe over 1 billion dollars. NO way of winning this game! Not fun to always lose. Buy Zoo tycoon or Rollercoaster tycoon, or Resort tycoon, or Farm tycoon or SIM city instead. These games are winable."
Very misleading name. You cannot file business taxes with this software.
Pain in the butt to install and get it to open. Gave me the Open exclusively by another user error for the data files.
fast shipping my girl friend loves the game sucks I got it because shes more into the game then spending time with me so yea this is a very addictive game...
"I have always been interested in genealogy.  While working on my own family tree, I wanted a program to store and organize all my information.  This fits the bill perfectly.  I have only begun using, but so far I am very pleased."
"I usually use Turbo Tax every year to do my taxes as well as taxes for family members.  I thought that the 10% bonus for putting all or part of the Federal refund onto an Amazon gift card was a great idea and I was excited about doing so.  Alas, I owed the Federal government money and didn't get a return.  Still an awesome deal!!"
"The product arrived on time, properly packed and labeled. I inmediately installed it and it worked very well since the very beggining."
This was the place to get the best price!!!! I went everywhere it there was a good $60 difference!
A great project for the entire family.  Easy to install and use.  Amaze friends and family with personalized cards to add to their special day.  Lots of cards to choose from and other templates for daily use.  Would make a great gift also.
"It works for learnsmart access only!!  If you need CONNECT access don't buy this product.  Although it is the same company and same book, they aren't able to transfer your access code to CONNECT.  You will have to buy a whole new code."
"I have a MAC and my daughter needed Microsoft Office to work on homework. It was so fast and easy to download. I'm glad I got it. Didn't have to run to the store to get the program, Amazon made shopping easy!"
"I found the Linux Mandrake to be a wonderful operating system even for the beginner.  The installation was easier than Windows 98 and took half the time to install.  The Mandrake comes loaded with hundreds of applications including Sun's Star Office which to me now is a must have.  (I could write a whole other review about Star Office.)  For the Linux newbee I would suggest to know what componets you have in your computer and cross reference them with the Mandrake web site to see if they are supported. Also read the documentation before you install and if you can afford it, give Linux its own hard drive. However if you don't have the luxuary of having a second hard drive, Linux Mandrake can prove to be a good neighbor with Windows.  I would recommend this OS to anyone who is willing to learn and wants to try something new.  I have tried other flavors of Linux and so far the Mandrake has proved to be my favorite."
"Not user friendly, did not help my husband at all, it is sitting on my desk collecting dust."
"I used to be loyal to Kapersky back when it used to take up very little processing power. Now it has turned into a CPU hippo like Mcafee and Norton. It works well for the most part though. However, as the expiry date approches, you'll start to get these highly annoying pop ups telling you to renew. The closer it gets to the expiry date, the more pop ups you get and the larger they are. After the product expires, you are bombarded with giant pop ups telling you to renew. Sometimes a pop up would appear while you are doing something else like playing a video game or watching a movie, which is insanely annoying. Because of this, I am no longer going to purchase another Kapersky product."
"Poor download and burn don't throw away your money. No two downloads the same, sone work and some don't.
There are other  sellers at amazon that do better"
"It's fine. I thought it would be like the picture in the ad and come with the factory instruction manual, but it didn't. It's just a copied disc of the original program. Because it's an old program, instructions aren't available online."
"I really had very little idea how taxes worked when I got married and had to start doing them on my own.  Then someone told me about TurboTax and I swear by it ever since.  This program takes you through step by step on how to do everything and what information needs to be put where.  If I can use it effectively, then anyone can.  I will always use this program for my taxes from now on."
"I used Visual Studio 6 / Visual Interdev a lot and found it very good. I'm a decent VB programmer so I created several apps and managed our corporate website /sub webs with it too. I could do all that my business group needed. VS.NET 2003 has just made all that a lot, lot harder for not much gain. Aside from learning the new languages VB.NET and C# which I don't really mind the new asp.net and web site development is horrendous for people who do it all themselves. It was a lot simpler before. First time you try to delete a test project you won't find a delete option or anything in the help about it. It turns out you need to use explorer to delete the files and IIS to remove the virtual site. Why would they do that? In short the gains are mainly for the big enterprise users with 2003 servers running IIS6. $$$. Very disappointing really and I really like Microsoft stuff. Microsoft SQL server is fantastic for instance. Good luck and be prepared to study..."
"As Always, Amazon.com does it again! Great Products, Great Suppliers, Great Prices!"
I did not like the ZoneAlarm suite.  Either I or the software is not smart enough to make it work in a multi-user PC.  I am very disappointed  with the product.
"This is the worst software that I've bought in quite a while - it's buggy - provides very litte functionality, and is WAY OVERPRICED.  They have no Tech Support - Go ahead and JUST TRY to call their Tech Support Line (949) 341-0007 - Option 4 for Customer Support - they will never answer the phone - it just rings and rings... !!

 But the worst part is that you THINK you are buying a piece of software that you can use for multiple phones as you change phones and upgrade to newer models - Oh NO!  You've got to RE-BUY their software each YEAR!  In order to get the needed USB Cell Phone drivers for any new phone - What a rip off !!"
Didnt work for me but the seller/service was excellent
Great value and seems to be doing it's job well.  Have been using it about a month.
"I didn't care for all of the ""hidden"" charges."
Very satisfied
"I find the Hallmark Card Studio 2014 very helpful in making cards for special occasions, making flyers and for making labels for church card ministry for shut ins."
"After reading all the negative reviews of Quicken H&B 2014, I went ahead and ordered it with great trepidation.  Before loading it, I made sure that I had all my files (6 of them) backed up and that I still had my Quicken H&B 2011 original disk. I only use the program on my laptop and my desktop (using Windows 7), so I cannot speak to how version 2014 works on mobile devices.  Loading the new program into both computers went flawlessly and so has the operation of them.  Converting my data files to the 2014 format went without a hitch.  I haven't seen any differences between the 2011 and 2014 version other than regaining the one step update function.  Downloads from my brokerage worked flawlessly and at the same speed as my 2011 version.  I don't download bank data, so I can't speak to that.  The program I received from Amazon was release #1 and after I put it on the computers, I was upgraded to release #7.  I couldn't see any differences between the two.  Maybe the problems were in the use with mobile devices.  I rely on Quicken heavily, so paying less than $100 every third year is well worth it to me."
"I have been using PSP since the days when it was free. I was finally forced to give up my beloved PSP8 version when I moved to Win7 64-bit. Though I actually purchased this version from Corel, my experience with this product and the company has been so negative I felt others should know. For 2 days now I have experienced repeated failures in getting this software to install and run. (I have a high level of knowledge and experience, going back to the Commodore Vic 20) I have tried many different installation methods, including those suggested by Corel. Perhaps more frustrating than the software is the horrible experience I have had with the company. In spite of having paid for the product, received a serial number, and gone through the web site registration process, I am forbidden access to the website for any sort of communication, even to post in the forums or send a contact e-mail. Only registered users are allowed the privilege, and though I'm registered...I'm not. The only recourse was to wait out a long distance phone call for 40 minutes in order to reach support (which, so far, has been useless). You're allowed one free call BTW. Each one after that costs $20! At this point I feel like some criminal organization has bilked me out of $60 and left me to flounder. I could install and open X4 once. Then, each time I closed and re-opened it, it would refuse to run, bringing up the same error about my copy having been damaged or illegally installed. I was able to get a taste of the program during these brief snippets. Sadly, what used to be a relatively simple-to-use and very capable program now suffers from bloat and an overabundance of ""features."" Gone is the simple, clean interface of past versions, which allowed one to do a day's work without encumbrance and confusion. The work area is now fractured into a complex of separate panes, a virtual rip-off of Microsoft's Expression Web. New and experienced users alike will spend lots of time trying to locate a simple function. Functionality is also hindered by an almost unusable gray color scheme, someone's idea of dee-zign (already bearing an onslaught of user complaints). Worst of all, the former re-sizable browser window with its variable thumbnail array, where the bulk of the management chores took place, has been replaced by a scrollable horizontal banner that runs across the bottom of the work area. A limited number of thumbnails can be displayed here at one time (even on a wide-screen monitor), leaving one to constantly scroll back-and-forth to view bits and pieces of the thumbnail library. It apparently can be expanded vertically, at the expense of squeezing all other panels into the top of the screen, but gone is the ability to view and manage a large array of thumbnails at a glance. In short, my brief experience demonstrated that the old, easy-to-use PSP, which offered pros and semi-pros, like me, A wide array of effective tools in a relatively clean and useable interface, is gone. Corel now offers a program crammed with salable ""features"" few will ever understand (or use), and has eliminated a very functional work-a-day interface, replacing it with one who's main features seem to be confusion, complexity, and eye-candy. Tragically, for Win 7 users there is no viable competition without moving into very expensive territory. Who knows, if I could just get it to install and run, I might find it workable in spite of its bugs and unbelievably awful interface.

Addendum: I was able to turn up clues that X4, unfortunately, employs DRM protection(!), and recognized that my installation failures were probably related. After 2-3 hours online with a very nice Corel tech assistant, the infernal DRM software defeated any and all attempts to allow us to get X4 running. Corel finally had to resort to allowing me to download a disk image and try running from that. After three days of efforts, X4 is up and running. I thank Cameron for the informative tip, which reminds me this program is going to require some relearning. Still, I feel that a program that used to allow all functions from a single screen, and now requires mousing back-and-forth between three different interfaces to get the same things accomplished, is not progress. Perhaps experience will change my view, but it' really irrelevant since there are few alternatives."
It turned out this not what I needed  but works perfect...
This simply a registration number. No data.
very cool
"My kids, ages 6 and 12 neither one liked it. One thought it was too young, one thought it was boring. Was not the tool I was looking for."
Works
"Most disappointing with this version of Norton.  Constantly attempting to up-sell other Norton Products and the program runs 'backround checks' while you are trying to work on the computer.  A Norton screen pops up literally almost every time I am on the ocmputer, where Norton usually does a great job 'running in the background""..NOT THIS YEAR.  VERY annoying."
"Actually I did not read it closely enough to see that this was actually Windows 8 and I would have to download the update to get Windows 8.1, otherwise I would not have spent $86 for it.  I wanted the actual Windows 8.1 version because I already had Windows 8 and was having a very hard time downloading the update since our internet connection was very slow, so I wanted to get it on DVD so I wouldn't have to download it.  Now because I opened the package and put the dvd in my computer to see what it was, but nothing else, I can't get my money back.  I was not at all happy with this purchase."
Excellent music. Also excellent Amazon support in helping to download in iTunes format.
I purchased this item for someone else they said that it was a good item. Thanks for the product a+
My kids loaned it to someone and never got it back so we got another because they like to play it over and over.
A little hard to use.  Once you have tried it a few times works pretty good.  Does not give you the option to print one side separately from the other side.  Once I printed wrong so it printed one side on two seperate sheets of paper. I wanted to just load one page back in but it would not let me print just one side
"I used this product since 1988 (DOS, 5.25"" floppies), and wouldn't want to give it up.  I've been buying it through my FI which has a partnership discount rather than from a re-seller like Amazon.com & Costco.  Right now, what you get is a TurboTax ""shell"" to transfer last year's ""info data"" to the current year, and forms which act as placeholders until finalized forms are released by the IRS.  The State forms are preliminary and incomplete, and they are last to be released by TurboTax, because typically, State tax codes are based off of what the Feds do.  Also, at this time, W-2's, 1099's, 1098's, etc. haven't been released, and although you can backfill them from all your 12/31/2012 statements, it reduces the ease you are trying to achieve.  Also, wait until your IRS report forms are received, then do an online software update.

TurboTax evolved to a Q&A type format which remains the user interface for the past decade or so, grouping similar topics together like ""Income"", ""Deductions"", ""Taxes Paid"", etc.  I think it reflects how many taxpayers think about the topics.

Previously, users have complained about the cost of State efile, and pricing structure.  I haven't studied the 2012 structure, but here are the usual suspects:

(1) State efile fee of $20  --  I just send in the paper and avoid the fee (3-4 weeks to receive a state refund).  Not really Turbotax's issue as the states should get together and perhaps adopt a common platform which Turbotax & HR Block acn just charge a nominal fee for any state rather than the (2011) $20 to file.
(2) My complaint is the ""up sell"" needed to do stock/securities sales --  previously, it seems the ""Deluxe"" was adequate for typical mutual fund or occassional broker transactions, but the TurboTax's ""guide"" points me to the ""Premier"" edition to do something that is common to many households  --  kind of like paying for ""premium"" airfare ticket to use the toilet (not everyone will use the on-board toilet, but come on, don't price it to be an extra).
Admittedly, while there appears to be rising SRP, the actual price paid seems to be just inflation indexed, rather than real increases (unlike my cable & cell phone bills) -- I'm skeptical about the ""more features for the same money"" explanation.
(3) Historically, price for the 2nd State was somewhat exhorbitant (is it still $40 ? used to be $20) - -  I needed it for several years because of relocations and cross-state situations (NY-NJ-CT is common, maybe DC-MD-VA.  TurboTax says it's competitive, I say it's the last gas station for 100 miles so better buy it at whatever they charge.

In the past, I have had several issues with TurboTax, and because I now look for them, it is hard for me to determine if they still persist, or TurboTax has solved them.

(1) Previously, the NY State software would default to Itemized Deduction if I Itemized for Fed filing --  in NY, often STANDARD Deduction is better than the adjusted Itemized Deduction (State taxes are not deductible for State returns, and for many renters, Standard would be better).  The State software was too dumb to do a comparison between the two.  I had to do an overide for several years but now don't live in NY anymore (NOTE: your state may require the same deduction election).
(2) I now file Form SE, and the first time using it, it would populate numbers that were VERY difficult to determine the source. It required a lot of cross checking to determine where the numbers were coming from.  It seems the Interface now has a specific question employment by International Organizations which don't have payroll deduction.
(3) In California (during 2003-09), TurboTax would not apply capital loss carry-forward to state taxes, and I paid state taxes on capital gains w/o offset from carryover capital losses.  I overpaid several hundred $ of Calif taxes, and when I became aware, was able to file an amended return (see below).  (Odd since Intuit's HQ is in Mountain View, Calif.)
(4) Compared to versions from years ago, the software has have much less ""data source"" documentation.  In the older versions, you could click on a field and it would send you to the field, form or info page where the data / number was transferred from.  Now, you get a vague entry that doesn't help to quality-assure the various numbers.

The Amend Return function for states is now much easier  --  I needed to use it for 3 consecutive years in arrears because of Turbotax sofware bugs.  Beginning around 2008, the software was able to provide (for states) a function that allowed more automation to the process.

I applaud TurboTax's ""User Account"" approach for online purchasers whereby you can download the software for at least 3 years.  When I filed amended returns, I had a different PC and was able to download the software to use.  I don't know about CD purchasers from re-sellers though.

Overall, it is still very good software, but you need to do manual tracing on the State return to validate, particularly if you have special situations which reduce your taxes."
"After you install Snow Leopard you may notice programs not working.  If it's not the latest version of the software chances are that they won't.  You'll then need to go to the software site, or where ever to more than likely purchase the upgrade.  The $25 soon jumps up.  And you'll need to do this for each program, which can be costly and time consuming.  I've been on Mac's for almost 20 years and this is the worst system change that I've ever gone through.  By the way, if you do install it, make sure you have a Time Capsule back-up before you do (buy a cheap external hard drive if you have to) but it could save you a major hassle (of which I personally know)."
Would not open.
"Having upgraded from powerdvd 13 this version loads faster and remembers settings.
For instance with powerdvd 13 it would not save the sound settings and I would have to change the setting each time I played a movie.
With this version set it once and your done.
The one big problem is it has problems with mono soundtracks.
I have two Blu-Ray movies that will not play sound unless you change the language.
There maybe others but I am not sure as I have not tried some of my DVD movies that have mono sound tracks
So Soylent Green or The Maltese Falcon are silent unless to switch languages other than english.
Support has been useless as they don't take support issues serious.

Powerdvd 13 played these movies fine and do other software players on the same PC.
Yet after telling support this fact they still ignore the facts and want you to try stupid things like reinstalling the program.
Or trying to play the disc on another player.

They don't really read what you tell them.

My guess is they didn't add the support for mono sound tracks to this version."
No where does it say it's a 7 day trial until it's downloaded. My anti-virus program kicked in Immediately. Do not download this product!
"I believe this program to be a good one, however, I do not find it to be user friendly. The user guide is very confusing. Uses too much technical jargon that the average home user probably can't understand.
I sent them an e-mail requesting assistance and the reply was of such a technical nature that I was ubable to use it. Wrote them again and asked for clarification but received no reply."
Only for the most beginner's of quilters.  Not enough choices in patterns or fabrics.
"The install on one machine worked really well. On the 2nd machine, the installation did hang up forever. I had to then manually uninstall the 2007 Norton version, then go to Symantec's website to download a special uninstaller, and then only I could install the 2008 version without a problem. There is not much new from the 2007 version. I did not find the ad blocking and pop up feature which seemed to work fine last year. Now I get annoying ads pop up on certain sites. A good product, but you need some patience until it's installed and working properly."
"I received the CD and I  could never get it to work as it required administrative approval.

"I've been using Windows 7 since its beta release, but my laptop's been running the final version for weeks now. I really disliked Vista and preferred XP still, but Windows 7 has tipped the scales...finally. Windows 7 has been reliable and it's snappier than Vista.  Windows 7 sips laptop battery power so my 1-year-old Dell XPS M1530 runs longer under Win7 than it did under Vista.  But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers. Here's a list of my favorites:

#1 VIRTUAL LIBRARIES
With virtual libraries, the special folders like Documents, Pictures, Music and Videos have all become libraries. Instead of being a physical storage location, they're indexes that point to one or many locations on the computer you're using, as well as other computers you're networked with. In a home setting, where you're running Windows Home Server, you can now easily direct file stores to your server.  Also in the home, housemates can easily see each others' data by including their respective folders in one another's libraries. When you search a library, you're searching your computer and any other computer that has folders you've added to your library.  You determine which physical location will be the default location for saving new files to your library.  This is, for me, the single best feature of Windows 7, and is an excellent reason to upgrade.

#2 START SEARCH
The Start Search has been improved in Windows 7 so results appear instantly as soon as you click the Start button, and then either type the name of a program on your computer, or a task you'd like to perform (like, ""change my display settings""). No more hunting folder hierarchies to find that elusive program, or spend time figuring out where Microsoft has placed something in the Control Panel. This is a tremendous time-saver.

#3 AERO SNAP
The Aero user interface has three new tricks -- Shake, Peek, and Snap -- but only Aero Snap is a major leap forward. Have you ever tried comparing the contents of two windows together, side-by-side? It's painful to do because you have to fiddle with resizing the two windows. With Aero Snap, now all you do is grab the title bar of one window, sling it to the left, and Windows 7 will automatically resize the window to fill-up one-half of your screen display. Do the same with a 2nd window by slinging it to the right, and it'll fill-up the right-side of your display. You can start comparing two windows in...an Aero Snap. Aero Shake and Peek are cute, but not nearly so helpful.

#4 TASKBAR
Gone is the Quick Launch bar that too many people didn't know existed. Now, the whole Taskbar is a quick launch bar -- drag and drop any program icon onto the bar, and you're one click away from starting the program. Also, it's so easy to move the taskbar around now. I keep it on the left vertical on my computer. Gone is the system tray, too -- Notification Area takes its place. The Action Center alerts you to anything you need to do to keep your computer working smoothly.

#5 PROGRAM COMPATIBILITY
Any program can be run in one of many compatibility modes now. Windows 7 has a wizard that will help you pick the right, earlier version of Windows under which to run an older program -- just right-click on the program icon and choose ""Troubleshoot Compatibility"". Or, You can do the same thing more quickly by right-clicking on a program icon, click the Compatibility tab, enable Compatibility mode, and select the earlier version of Windows you want to run with your program.

#6 STICKY NOTES
Less functional that the Vista Sticky Notes -- which nobody used -- but now I actually use Sticky Notes to put reminders on my Desktop. They're quick, easy, and work just like a regular Post-It note only you don't get fingerprints on your screen!

#7 JUMP LISTS
There are two kinds -- Jump lists that let you quickly pick a task to perform, and Jump lists to quickly select a document to open and edit in the associated program. Jump lists include most recently used files, or you can pin your own files, too.  These are nice time-savers.

#8 SAVED SEARCHES
In Windows Explorer, you can create filtered searches and then save them in your Favorites for later use. This is handy to find filtered data in the future. When you re-execute the search, it creates a dynamic results set (so your search is never stale).

#9 CONTENT VIEW & ARRANGING
Also in Windows Explorer, two new features. Now you can arrange a folder into subdivisions by date (great for your pictures folders!). You can use the Content view to combine thumbnails of files along with details that usually are found only in the Details view.

#10 USER ACCOUNT CONTROL
Most everyone hated UAC in Vista (even though it helped to keep your computer safe). In Windows 7, Microsoft tamped down the annoyance factor of UAC. You can change your date and time without setting off UAC, for example. You can also decide whether UAC should go into secured Desktop mode whenever it does get triggered (secured Desktop is when your screen darkens and you're forced to respond to UAC's dialog box asking permission to run a program or make a change to your system). You can easily turn-off UAC, too.

#11 PAINT, WORDPAD, CALCULATOR
All three of these utilities got updated. Wordpad and Paint have the Office-like ""ribbon"" now, and Calculator has a few new memory keys, touch sensitivity, and a Programmer view for those dealing with hexidecimals and binaries.

#12 HOMEGROUP SHARING
This is the easiest way to share data with others in your (home) network. HomeGroup creates a password that is shared among computers, and that takes care of all the issues with user accounts, file permissions and ""access denied"" problems. This is great for unsophisticated home networks.  I made this feature last because I'm not using it -- I just think it's a great idea for inexperienced users.  Note:  all the networked computers need to be running Windows 7 to make HomeGroup sharing work.

Upgrading advice:  I went through the upgrade process twice.  Here's what I learned to do before and after the upgrade:  1)  Remove Adobe Reader and reinstall the latest version (9.2 as I write this) after the upgrade.  Older versions of Reader won't render correctly in Windows 7 and an IE8 browsing session.  2) Remove your antivirus, anti-malware and anti-spyware programs, and reinstall them after the upgrade using the latest versions available.  3)  Remove any virtualization programs (like VMWare Workstation) and reinstall following the upgrade.  4)  After the upgrade, look for the latest video driver from the video card maker, not by your computer hardware vendor (in my case, it was getting a new driver from Nvidia rather than from Dell).

Looking to do a clean install using this upgrade disk?  You can, but here's how.  Insert the DVD and choose ""Custom"" to do the clean install.  During the install, DO NOT enter your product id or activate Windows -- yet.  Instead, you'll finish the clean install, reboot, then use your DVD to do an upgrade of the clean install of Windows 7.  Yes, you're upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 7.  After you upgrade, then enter your product id and activate Windows.  I haven't tried this out personally, but others have and have done so successfully.  Add a comment to my review to share your experience if you go this route.  Final note:  This tip isn't intended to circumvent the stipulations in the licensing agreement for upgrading your computer.  If you're not entitled to upgrade (because, say, you're using Windows 95, 98, 2000, or ME), then you must buy the full version.  As I tell my kids, ""Just because you can do a thing doesn't mean you should do a thing.""  :-)

And finally, my few quibbles with Windows 7:  My Dell XPS M1530 has always had sporadic issues resuming from a sleep or hibernate state under Vista.  That still is the case, even with Windows 7.  I'm not convinced, though, that the underlying problem is an operating system issue as much as a hardware/BIOS problem, so I can't knock Windows 7 for this problem.  Not all my laptops have had similar power-on problems, even under Vista, so my advice to you is to NOT expect Windows 7 to solve any power-on problems from a sleep or hibernate state if you've currently got those problems with your laptop.

Lastly, if you like to periodically examine the Reliability Monitor in Vista, it's not as nice in Windows 7 -- there is no precise data value assigned to your machine's ever-changing reliability metric.  And it's impossible to find in the Control Panel (but it's easy to do a Start Search on).  The graph is still there, though, and it's updated hourly instead of daily.  For most people, I'm guessing this is a complete non-issue.

In short, think of Windows 7 as Windows Vista done right."
Quickbooks meets all of my accounting and invoicing needs. They are constantly updating the software to stay current. Customer services fixes any glitches very quickly.
The only security I will buy for my computer
"I have all of Print Shop programs and have always been partial to Print Shop 12.  It's a simple program to learn and has lots of great graphics to choose from. I always recommend this  program over all the other programs from other companies especially for beginners because it's so user friendly. If you can find Print Shop 12 buy it, you won't be sorry. It might be an old version but it has everything a person that is just getting into editing photos would need."
It's been determined the Windows7 Home Premium is not genuine & is a pirated copy & is not a valid activation code. I am extremely dissatisfied!!!
"I upgraded from a 2008 version, so I was able to use that for three years. For the 2011 version, that will work out to $20 per year. Having the ability to download from my mutual funds and credit card is worth that to me. I don't download directly from Bank of America because they charge $10 PER MONTH! for that capability. So I have to manually download the transaction files and then update Quicken. (BoA bought out my former bank, so that is how I ended up doing business with them.)

Yep, there is not all that much change, except for the new file format. I am glad, however, to have that aspect tidied up. There is also an improvement in the use of Help. Unless it has not worked correctly on my computer, what I have always found is that if I opened Help and then switched windows to go to another application, when I Alt+Tabbed back I could not get to Quicken directly; I would always be taken to Help. And I would have to minimize Help to see the register. No more. I can directly switch back and forth among Quicken, Quicken Help, and any other window.

I had no problems installing and switching over to the new version. I haven't had it a month yet, so all I have done is download and enter transactions. But it has been smooth sailing, except for one glitch, and that one has been a problem for years. I decided to try out Quicken Support's online chat, and I got an immediate solution.

The problem has been that when funds were swept from my IRA brokerage account to my IRA money market account, sometimes Quicken would seem to get hung up on the issue that the money market account cannot have cash balances. For reasons I have never figured out, it would not use the share purchase information in the downloaded transaction, and I would end up with a BoughtX transaction that didn't buy anything. When that happened I would manually edit the transaction to fix it. Instead, the tech support person told me to use Ctrl+z. That shortcut recalculated all the transactions in the account and fixed the flawed transaction. I have to say that I am pleased with the support I received; my problem was fixed in minutes. It should not have occurred in the first place, and that is why I didn't give a five-star rating.

Furthermore, I really haven't given the program a work-out yet, but so far, so good."
"Awful, awful, awful.  I bought this product because I hate how Quicken makes you pay $40 for an update every couple of years even though you own the software.  This iBank product was a pain to download, it won't update from my financial institution, is difficult to navigate, looks ugly, etc.  It looks and behaves very amateurish compared to Quicken, which I will be forced to go back to.  Very disappointed, and I feel ripped off."
"I like Quicken and have slowly become familiar with its peculiarities. I wish that when one decides to reduce the size of the data file by using the end-year copy function with the ""I only want transactions in my current data file starting with"" option really worked. Every time I have tried to use this option my investments and loans data get corrupted. The file is ""OK"" according to Quicken but the investments and loans data is erroneous. Otherwise, it is the best platform based, as opposed to cloud based, accounts tool available. I prefer platform based applications. I don't, at present, believe that the cloud is completely secure and do not store sensitive data in the cloud."
unfortunally i lost money buying the turbo tax cd if i knew they asked for my 2012 tax files i would never bought the cd I now have to travel to the united states to file my 2013 taxes and i only order one cd why they sent me two and charge me for two i don't get it
"This game was bought for my son 1-2 years ago when he was a toddler.  Now that he's four we started using it.  There is an error in the piano game that basically teaches your child how to spell words incorrectly putting in lots of incorrect letters at random. The piano game features prominently in many of the exercises, so you basically have to do a work around throughout the entire process.

What really gets me though is 1) I recently bought what I thought was an upgraded version of the game only to find the problem had not been fixed by the manufacturer 1) there are no patches or upgrades available to fix the problem, 2) the manufacturer states on their website that they will not give a refund for this game.  Buyer beware."
"I have used and prefer LOTUS since the late 70s,  Not as fancy as some others, but not as complicated either."
The purchase was easy as well as the download and installation.
"As a person who drives for a living, Weather Bug Plus is a Godsend.  Being able to get accurate forcasts makes my job that much easier to plan for.  I also like being able to actually see what type of weather is heading in my direction using the radar feature.  My only regret, is that it does not as yet come in a full screen version, but hopefully that will be corrected soon."
"Why? It claims to back up a directory like Users in Vista but on checking does not do so completely. I am using the latest downloaded version. It also fails in this way on reinstall. I cannot be bothered with it any longer so have uninstalled it. I will just use EMC Retrospect which does back up when it says it has even though as somebody else has mentioned it has an interface that reminds me of 1980s computing.
 If you do try this software do not be taken in by thinking that you have backed up when the software says it has done so. Try a restore to a new file or check what has been backed up and that it's what you wanted backed up!"
Great Price!
"I started having huge slow downs on two home computers.  A system service running on XP (see scvhost.exe in the Task Manager window) was taking 99% of all of the CPU time a while after bootup and I couldn't do anything other than kill the process which caused side affects.  I did have Norton anti-virus but it was out of date since I didn't renew it because when I got it I could use it on both of my home PCs but the renewal only allowed me to use it on one PC.  So, I couldn't decide what to do for a couple of weeks then, like an idiot I bought Microsoft OneCare (you could use it on three PCs and MS knows everything).  It found NO problems, was completely happy, and slowed down my computer to a crawl and kept displaying pop-up messages about my computer being at risk (since it was a day or two since my last update). I had to dump it!  Then I got Kaspersky.  It immediately found my problem and quarrantined an accellerator application I got from my ISP (that had been running great for two years).  No more slow down and the CPU was back to frequent idle.  So, Kaspersky worked great.  Why four stars?  Well, I haven't tried or know about all anti-virus programs, maybe there is still something better. But for now, I'm sold.  Lesson: Be sure to try the trial period of OneCare before buying if you are considering that product!"
This was a gift for my mother in law. I should have had the guide with it. It would make things easier for her if it did. When you clicked the short cut on the desk top it would come up with an error. We had to uninstall and install again. I'm not sure if this is working right or not because I have never used this product. If anything new develops I will come back and add to my review.
"I downloaded pc matic.  I gave my credit card information for 1 year service.  It downloaded for what I thought was 1 year.  Then without even running even once it said I had to renew.  I tried and tried giving my info for 1 year purchase,  the same thin happened.  I had to renew for a lifetime over $300 charge and it never ran.  I can not contact pc matic.  I can not remove it from programs.  It holds my computer up with a pop up to renew.  Help if any one has a way to contact them.  I want it off my programs even when it is not a program that I can use.  A true bait and switch"
"So far, so good!  I'm using it right now, and haven't had any security issues!"
"I purchased french 1+2 about 2 months ago after I tried the demo session on their website. I love how the material is arranged and I always feel I am learning gradually at a nice pace every session. I just finished the french level 1 today and I am going to continue to level 2 immediately. I already got 3+4+5 after it's released before thanksgiving, and I am sure I will continue to learn with the program and will not give up.
thanks Fluenz team for putting this wonderful program together, you are really really helping me learn something i never thought i can :)"
Great game!
good virus protection for the price
"Have always liked this software. A few changes from the old format. Still a great tool to work with.
The best part.... a free upgrade to 6.5!"
I use it every year. It sure saves me a lot of time and work. I would not do my taxes without it.
ok...!!!
"Apple iWork '08 has a clean interface, is horribly easy to use and contains all the tools I need to run a small business.  I am extremely happy with this product.
Don't let the beautiful templates fool you.  I had Office 2004 on my Mac, but since acquiring iWork have deleted it."
"Far too often reviewers (that have very little expertise with a particular product or field) rant on about what they perceive is a failure of the product, when in reality it's not a failure of the product, it's a failure of the individual in not reading the manual, not following proper directions, or simply not checking for compatibility when purchasing the product.

We see this all the time in the technical field, so often that we generally tell the customer (that's ranting on about how a product doesn't work when we know it does) that their hardware or software issue is called an ID-IO-T (pronounced I-D, I-O, T) error.  It makes them feel good, and they don't even realize that to the tech working on their issue ID IO T really means (idiot).

That's not to say that some hardware or software doesn't work, but even then it's usually caused by somebody assuming that a 5 year old Windows XP version of software ""should"" work on his/her Windows 7 Pro 64 bit workstation.  Unless it states Windows 7 Pro compatible on the box, don't assume it works and most of your tech support issues will magically disappear.

The same is true with hardware configurations as well."
I use this software quite a bit and would not have any other program.
"I really like this version of Quicken.  Easy to use, but sometimes crashes when I am updating accounts.  A quick restart usually fixes everything."
"First let me say that I'm a software developer and my girlfriend is from Germany. That being said I can say, from a developer's point of view, the software is top quality. And from a language point of view the phrases are practical and spot on or so my girlfriend says so ;)

The lessons are well organized. Each one builds on the previous. I feel that I don't learn too much in each chapter, avoiding that overwhelming feeling of too much at once, and that I don't learn too little. After a few chapters I can easily mix and match the words I've learned to create new and useful sentences. I do it all the time with my girlfriend to which she often replies ""sehr gut!"".

What I like most about Fluenz's approach is it's like a classroom. Meaning, there is a real person who breaks down each chapter's conversation and explains why you use each word in the way it's used. Most software just gives you words and expects you to memorize and learn through ""immersion"". I won't get into that debate because it's been debated all over the Internet ad nauseum. But if you're like me and learn faster by having someone break down each word of every sentence and explain it in great detail then you can't go wrong with Fluenz.

Oh and my favorite part of Fluenz is actually two things: top notch support and the free flashcard application. After I've done a chapter I feel pretty good (languages seem to come easy to me...either that or Fluenz is just that good lol) but once I've done the flashcards I feel like it's cemented in my brain and I can move onto another chapter much sooner than if there wasn't a flashcard system.

Ok, and so why do I think it's pracical? Because the software teaches you things you can start using right away to get around in the country. From the hotel to the cab to customs to restaurants and clubs. You can easily go to another country and get around right away with what you take away from this tool."
Really Speedy and as described. This product was so easy to install I would use this software again thank you
Fast delivery. I have been using this product for several years. Works great.
I got this for my Garmin Nuvi 750 which is not a marine gps. Thought I'd try to get double duty from it and it works pretty good. Since the 750 is not a marine unit it doesn't take full advantage of all the features on the card but works well enough. I think most recreational boaters would be ok with it.
"I've used tax cut for over 5 years, and it's usually great.
This year, I've experienced several errors and their tech support is less than helpful.
My state return was rejected because fields were left empty. It turns out the same fields were left out on my federal return also (at least on the printed copy for records).
The data was correct in the survey, but never made it to the actual form.

Looks like it's TurboTax next year."
great product easy to install and awesome concept to use windows on mac. i recommend it
The DVD quality is great. I showed it to my students several times - never had any problems with the dvd.
"Not bad but still not close to the Windows version. Despite 2 years of customer support saying it will happen, it still doesn't work with my brokerage account (T. Rowe Price- a big company). Even worse the error message isn't honest-instead of saying it doesn't work with T Rowe, the message tells you to keep trying. . It is clear Intuit hasn't dedicated the effort into the Mac version as it does to the Windows version."
"I have worked with Backup MyPC for nearly two months.  Support has been fairly responsive, though problems still persist. This is the first time I've written a review of any software, but I hope it will help others avoid the expense and frustration that I've had.

One one new Dell machine with a DVD drive, Automated System Recovery went very well.  Then after an early drive failure, I found that system restore did not work quite so well.  I was never able to boot the drive after several attempts at recovery.  That sort of defeated the purpose.

On another new Dell machine with a CD drive, I could never span disks with CD-Rs.  I ruined about 25 in the process of trying.  Memorex CDs showed erros with every attempt.  CD-RWs *would* span!  There was no mention of this in help files or by tech support.  But the program will not complete the system recovery for some reason with CD-RWs either.  After a few hours of mostly attended backup due to CD size, I get lockups on disk 3 or 4 or 5.  But who knows if the restore would even work if backup did?

I doubt that most reviewers will attempt a recovery just to test software.  I would love to speak to anyone who has successfully done so.  At this point, I seriously doubt that it can be done.

The software does fine on individual data (groups of files) backups and restores.  If that is all you want, go for it or get any free zipping utility.  If you want protection for a drive crash, I hope you have better results than I've had.

David - shopping for backup software again..."
"One of my friends have this product. I admit that I am a cyber-geek who always likes to try new software on my computer. However, trying this product is a nightmare for me. The word runs slowly and sometimes freeze(my laptop is a new Dell XPS M1530, which is one of the high-end products of Dell's). When I use the reviewing function, it happens frequently that some of my revisions are suddenly gone, and the revised portion is going back to the original@_@

I'd say the interface looks shinny, but the functionality is indeed terrible. I'm definitely going back to 2003..."
"If I could have rated this a ""zero stars"" I would have.  Will never use this product again. I bought it in January and got rid of it in March.  I will never use anything but Norton again. It slows your internet experience down drastically."
I use this often in my remodel business
"Waste of money. Don't buy it. Full of bugs. Requires an Intuit log-in before it'll download bank information. It wouldn't show old transactions until I reverted to a backup data file. The list goes on.  I was forced to upgrade from Quicken 2011 after it was hobbled by Intuit, but after a month of trying to make the migration to 2014 I gave up and requested a refund. Don't waste your time giving Intuit any more money. I'm going to try to make GnuCash or KMyMoney work instead, but I'll go back to a spreadsheet before I return to Quicken."
Excellent product. I am a teacher so it's perfect for my home and for my school work.
"Bought this at the end of the year to do my taxes, waited til now to do my taxes and the software doesn't work.  Doesn't load, doesn't respond, doesn't work.  Paid $58 for it and I can't return it.  Turbo Tax... I will NEVER use your software again.  Very angry about this."
Buy it every year
"Even non-""techy"" people can install this program. I always get nervous having to delete my security program before I can install the replacement, but I didn't have any problem with the download version I purchased. Thank goodness for Amazon...while I rely on my Norton program, it would have been much more expensive for me to renew my subscription directly through Norton."
"have used Turbo Tax for years because  it assure you do not miss or omit anything,and when you efile they keep you informed."
"works, true posting"
"I am very impressed with the flash drive that came with this software package.  After testing its performance, it is found to have a blazing read speed of 31 MB/s and a decent write speed of 5 MB/s.  Compared to the many cheap standalone flash drives on the market, the read speed is probably 4-6 times faster and the write speed is about the same.  The miniscule size of the drive makes it perfect for a keyring.  The tiny drive is inside a credit card sized sleeve that you see in the box.

The software interface is not very attractive.  There are a lot of features which do not seem necessary and it installed a difficult-to-remove CA browser toolbar which impedes surfing speed and ease.  Without a virus-laden computer to test it on I cannot comment on its performance.  The program uses an acceptable amount of memory and does not seem to slow down the computer.  Users of older machines may only achieve normal performance after turning off optional program features.

I definitely would not suggest buying this software at retail price, but rather watch for the frequent rebates on this and other CA products.  The flash drive is certainly the redeeming quality of this product and is definitely worth keeping for general use."
Easy to install and does a fantastic job of protecting my computer.
"Works like a charm, like always, and offers to save your return in pdf format. TaxCut by H&R Block does not offer to save as a pdf, but wants you to download some third party adware that will only let you save as a pdf if you review everything they want to sell you first."
Perfect!
I love Kaspersky!  Have used it for 5 years and never a problem.  Ordered the Key Card edition without disc and it tells me that the code I received is a invalid one.  Will not activate because of that issue.  Am returning and hoping to get one that it will accept.
"Haven't had any of the problems other users have described. The download and installation did take some time, but I didn't have any issues. Burning DVD's is as easy for me as previous versions of Nero were. So far, after burning about 20 DVDs, I don't have any complaints. I have Vista with 2 gigs of memory."
I downgraded from Quickbooks Pro to Quicken Home & Business and I really love it.....glad I Did......Quickbooks is a good program but too complexed and a memory hog....Thanks Quicken
Wonderful item.  Now I need to sit down and watch all my old VHS tapes and put them onto an external hard drive before all the VHS tapes go bad.
"Filing was relatively easy with Turbotax this year. The Deluxe edition did include one state return although there was a 25$ filing fee for my state. It did fail to efile initially whilst I was wirelessly connected to the system of tubes, citing an ""SSL Error"". Googling this problem suggested that it might be resolved by plugging an ethernet cord directly into a router. This strategy, bypassing my wifi for whatever reason did resolve the issue and allow me to efile."
Useful needed tool.
Does what is advertised.
"Very disappointed. I have Publisher 2010, and upgraded in hopes of being able to import EPS 3.0 graphics. Microsoft says this imports EPS, but clearly not all.

Beyond file importing issues, version 2013 doesn't seem to offer much (anything?)  in terms of new functionality. I downloaded the software, so I can't return it. Definitely did not get value for my money."
"TaxCut offers individuals a powerful option for preparing an income tax return that is relatively easy to use. TaxCut assumes that you know little or nothing about income tax law. The software will ask a number of questions and will prompt you for information based on your answers. It will help tremendously if you gather as many of your tax documents as possible before starting. This software is significantly cheaper than paying a service to prepare it and much easier than doing in manually.

The e-file option has been around for some years and is a great way to get your refunds faster. But if you owe money, there's not as much of an advantage.  Still, you get five free electronic filing so you might as well use one.  In the unlikely event that you plan to prepare more than five returns, make sure you use the e-file for the ones due a refund and file the ones with money due manually.  The program will print all the forms you need so it's easy to do and it will save you the cost of the fees for the additional e-files.

There are a couple of issues to take note of if you buy this version of TaxCut.  First, this version covers only federal tax returns and does not include a program for state taxes.  If you live in a state with no income tax, this is the version you want.  But if you do need to file with your state, you'll want to buy the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/H-R-Block-TaxCut-2008-Premium-Federal-State-e-file/dp/B001HOD50K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">H&R Block TaxCut 2008 Premium Federal + State + e-file</a>&nbsp;version.  Second, there are some tax tools not included in this package that would require the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/H-R-Block-TaxCut-2008-Premium-Federal-e-file/dp/B001HO6Q7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">H&R Block TaxCut 2008 Premium Federal + e-file</a>&nbsp;version.  These probably won't be needed by everyone, but take a good look at the chart in the product description area to see if you will miss the features or not.

If you don't itemize your deductions and have a very simple return, you might be better off preparing the forms manually on your own. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you have a return with major league complications, you should probably go to a good CPA. For everyone else, this is really a no-brainer. It's inexpensive, easy to use, and accurate. I've been using TaxCut for quite a few years and would not even consider giving it up."
"I never got lost, its very useful. The only thing is that you have to carry your laptod in every stop."
"I pretty much expected I'd have to switch back and forth between environments, but with Coherence, it's like apps are just running on my Mac. Just note what I didn't notice in the product description: you don't get a disk, no big deal, but the download was more than 1/2 hour on my mediocre DSL. If I'd known that, I'd have downloaded in advance. You get a product key and a link to the download site. Install was mostly easy, except that I entered the product key for my copy of Windows wrong, but it kept restarting and trying to install, it never gave me the option of re-entering the product key after I got the invalid message from Windows. I had to manually stop the install and start over again. I don't notice any speed hit on my Mac other than when Windows Update is running."
"I live in WA so didn't order the state return module because we don't have state income tax. But upon completing the Federal return, I could not efile without also buying the state module. which cost me double because my checking account was overdrawn at the time by a software license renewal. After answering all the state module questions and providing the numbers, the program recommended that I NOT file the state return but keep for my notes. I efiled normally then. Very frustrating/infuriating..."
I am finally getting around to writing a review about this product.  I was very happy with my purchased and the Internet Security did the job it was designed to do.
"Awesome concept. The flashcards learn and adapt to how well you're answering different facts. They give you outline form of what you need to know for each disease. The info's really clear. As long as you get the big picture idea (from lecture), you can pretty much just study off this for most of the class. You can use the app when waiting in line or have some downtime, and the actual website when at home."
Installing Norton was easy and the peace of mind that it provides in its protection is priceless!! I always go with Norton!
"Several years ago I got Guitar Hero and Rockband for my family to play with.  We loved it and had a lot of fun with it...for a few months.  It didn't take long before I felt like i should be doing this with a real guitar instead of a plastic controller.  I searched high and low and there were no apps of any kind that could do that.  Fast forward a few more years...and I find Rock Prodigy...exactly what i was hoping for but better.  Something I can use my guitar with and learn to play.

Although I think the technology is great and everything - technology is just that...it's an enabler.  The real value I see here is the combination of this technology with the carefully crafted lessons and exercises and a lesson plan for what to practice and when.  Then there are the milestone pieces to really test how much you've learned...they can be real challenging and a lot of fun.  Over time I've noticed, that although the lessons and exercises are focused on a particular set of skills, there are actually multiple things being learned and reinforced in each one - this is what i mean by being carefully crafted...i'm learning more than i even realize and that really  does make the most of my time and learning.  Learning is fun i'm rarely ever stuck on anything so I am able to keep practicing - this is key.  Before RP I would find myself getting stuck on something and then i would stop practicing...for days, weeks, or even years before i got back to it.

Customer support has been fantastic.  The folks at Rock Prodigy answer every little question that I have about the app and have helped me to get the most out of it.

Challenges that I've had?  Well...it's a guitar...a musical instrument and not a plastic controller.  So I needed to learn how to tune it, turn up the volume and tone knob so the app could hear it better and not be so darn heavy handed with the strings since it can change the notes to be sharper than what is expected and the app will miss it...which is good...we're playing guitar here not Mario Brothers ;-)

I'm near the beginning of course 2 right now and for the first time I find myself watching the app and not looking at my left hand nearly as much.  My fingers are starting to find their place on the fretboard more easily...well a good chunk of the time anyway...but progress is happening and that keeps me playing!  I have a long way to go...but I feel like something is changing in me and the guitar doesn't feel as foreign to me as it used to."
I did download this thinking that there would be some lessons available for my 5th grader.  When you download it all of the lessons you have to pay for.  I called for assistance with the product only to find all the mailboxes are full.  I plan on reporting to the BBB
Constantly monitoring all the bad guys on the internet and keeps your computer safe.

"I didn't expect it to be as good as the much more expensive product, but it works the same way and as well."
"Very uneven quality with some screen captures used. some undersized still blown up too much and some good publicity stills.  Nothing you haven't seen better somewhere else.  Only the extreme 007 Bond fan will want this.  I bought it; but, it now resides in the storage box."
"Turbo premier gets better every year!  My only issue- if you will - is with the ""it's deductible "" which requires a subscription."

Best bang for the buck

"I had a very bad experience with this.  After using TurboTax for many years, I thought I'd see how a lower-priced product compared.  The program was difficult to update, though this was corrected through updating my Mac operating system.  Once updated, I worked through my federal return for about two hours, but when I proceeded to work on my state return, the program insisted that I pay $39.95 to download the state information.  After checking to ensure that the product included one state in the price, I called H&R Block customer service.  At the conclusion of a 40 minute call during which I explained the situation, and provided the authorization code that came with the product, the customer service rep told me she could do nothing for me, I would need to pay for the state information, and suggested that I contact Amazon.  I returned the product on Amazon for a full refund and purchased the TurboTax product which took less than five minutes.  The TurboTax product downloaded seamlessly, and while I paid a bit more for it, it actually works as advertised."
"There are seemingly a myriad of illustration programs and some do things better than others. Most digital illustrators work with several because no single application seems to do it all so well. But, I have to say, Serif DrawPlus X5 comes pretty close.

If I could make the perfect vector program it would be Autodesk Sketchbook, but Sketchbook is a bitmap program. What I like about Sketchbook is the intuitive, simple (but beautiful) interface. If I could write a program with all the features I could ever want I would make something like Adobe Illustrator. Adobe products are, for the most part, the heaviest on features but just so difficult to learn. Seems like I'm always jumping through hoops to get anything done in Adobe. Too many options. That marriage between the two programs, Sketchbook and Illustrator, might just be right here.

DrawPlus has similar buttons to Illustrator but unlike Illustrator, they tell you what the buttons do when you hover over them. This is incredibly helpful for the new user trying to remember what is what or trying to discover what other functions they might want to explore. Exploring in Illustrator is a hair raising experience. As in, 'I sure hope Ctl+Z can undo this and my program doesn't freeze trying to execute it'. On top of the descriptive hovering, the tools just make sense and seemed grouped together in a very logical fashion. For example, you don't have to go digging around to make simple shapes you use a lot, just click on the shape tool and the choices are there. I like that a lot.

Editing is a snap. DrawPlus gives you a shape or line with the simple understanding that it is made of points (nodes) and that you might want to move these nodes about a little. Simply click on the 'node' tool, select your point you want to manipulate and there you have it. Even better, the 'simple' shapes (circle, square, etc.) have built in node sliders that quickly let you make common adjustments to common shapes, which is just a brilliant feature. E.g. Do you want a square with sharp corners or rounded ones? How rounded? Well, just make a square and slide the lever to your roundness liking and there it is.

There are more features (animation, filter effects, etc.), or should I say enough to make most if not all of your graphic needs with very little effort in very little time. I was up and running creating graphic creations within 20 minutes. THAT'S what a vector drawing program SHOULD be like.

And here's the better part- they let you try it out (DrawPlus Starter) for free. Some of the more exciting features are disabled but there's certainly enough to get a great feel for it AND, best of all, no time limit! I tried it, LOVED it, and bought the full version. I have nothing but love for this vector drawing program."
"To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time where registering the product by supplying personal information is mandatory.  Upon installation, you are presented with a page to register the software and you are prevented from moving forward and cannot use Quicken until you complete the questionaire."
"This will load on an IPOD which makes it easy to use. At my age, learning a new language is not as easy as it is for a child, but this program seems to working. It is also far more affordable than the competition. Give it a try."
the software worded as needed. it was a good by for the price. item is recommended for the writing needs.
The download and installation were problem-free. I was able to load in my TurboTax records from the previous year. Be sure to perform a software update after installation.
This is so cooooooooooool! I just played SCOOBY DOO JINX AT THE SPHIX for the 100th time and it rocked me out! I love SCOOBY DOO a lot!
This is a better product than those in the series although I've used several with success. The newest version has much better separation of the parts and the instrument simulation quality has improved significanly. When working with already created tabs the ability to mute and adjust the balance levels is helpful when trying to get a feel for your own playing when you have limited time to work with a live band. A little difficult to work with if not experienced with using tab software and mixing sounds but an exelent tool and easy to use if you are experienced. It seems to still improve with each new version and the online resoures are good such as the forums and access to other product info and tip information.
Been using for years and this was the lowest price.  I don't renew but just buy new

NO HELP FROM SELLER ON HOWEVER TO FIX
PROBLEM.
seller did give me a refund.  My computer is still broke. I am not happy with this purchase at all."
"I have used Filemaker for many years, and it's the easiest database software to use.  I have several databases, large and small, on Filemaker, and I wouldn't be without it.  Filemaker 12 continues the tradition of excellent products."
"I ordered the original, free version of this, and have been pleased with its flexibility and clarity.  It is particularly helpful in that you can keep students up to date on any aspect of their performance, and you can obtain reports on any aspect of class performance.  It also is a fine scheduler, lesson planner, and attendance tracker.  Once I took the time to understand all of it, I was excited to see how much I could do with it.  Highly recommended until something better comes along."
"If you are looking for software for converting and saving audio files, this is not it.  I purchased this mainly because I was interested in being able to save my old cassettes and record albums onto my computer and thought the video portion would be a nice bonus.  However good it is at videos, it has no features or usability for audio.  You cannot edit, name, or convert the audio files in any way.  If you want a file with individual songs from your audio input, you have to stop the recording at the end of each song.  You can't just let it record from a cassette and later divide it up.  Further more, when I called customer service about this issue, they recommended that I use the free download of Audacity to edit the music.  One problem - Audacity won't open their music files, so you might as well use Audacity to record in the first place.  If they are going to advertise that you can use this for audio, then they should really give it at least some of the features that the video portion has."
"The type size, color and background are very hard to read when preparing your return. There is no provision to zoom or change settings."
"Incompatible with Windows 7.  Search online for info, none available from windows.
Loaded to Windows 10 and got error trying to register.
Then it said must restart win 10 to finsih
Guess what?  Windows restart failed!! auto repair invoked,  What did this program do?
Computer has restarted 4 times now, always ends in error restart.  Now I have to go to a restore point BEFORE I installed this crappy SW
Don't buy it"
"Had to upgrade to sucky Windows 10, needed my Corel, it's all good."
"Installed without any problems, works great"
"You may not want to put a lot of stock in this review, since my wife (not I) is the main user, and I don't have a lot of details.  But it seems like when Endnote is running, Word will often hang.  Maybe this is specific to Intel-based machines.  Maybe the problem is actually with Word; it seems to hang even without Endnote, although Endnote seems to exacerbate the problem.  But we're not wild about the end result."
"I've been using Dragon since version 5. This is the worst in one major respect: it is compatible with practically nothing. I had WordPerfect x6 with Dragon v. 12.5 and it was fine in Windows 7. There were problems after I moved to Windows 10. I upgraded Dragon to v. 13, but it wouldn't work with WordPerfect. x6. Nuance's website suggested I move up to x7, which I did. It hangs up every time. It also hangs with Google Chrome,even with the dragon extension installed.
Altogether an unsatisfactory product."
"I wish I could give this a better rating, as I'm generally a big fan of the Reader Rabbit series. I've used these programs for each of my four kids, and we've been through every grade level (including the previous version of RR Kindergarten).
Plus, I generally liked the construction of the game. It had a good story line, great activities and a very age-appropriate feel.
The main problem was that it's WAY too short - there's just not enough material for it to be really useful. Each activity is completed in just a few trials.
It's not even long enough for the auto-levelling feature to work well. It starts each activity on the easiest level, and a student that needs a more advaced level can zoom through and be finished before there's even a chance for it to ratchet up the level of difficulty.
I'll also give it a slight ding for not giving enough guidance toward the right answers. There's not much negative feedback for wrong answers, and it's possible to pass the activities by pure guessing. Sometimes it doesn't give any indication at all when an answer is missed.
All in all, this is an unusually poor showing for a program in the RR line-up."
"I have been a 10+ year quicken user and am thrilled with the new version.  It takes a little time getting accustomed to the new layout, but I learn a little more each day, and the transition has been fairly easy.  Even though many I know have switched to an online finance application, I like having a desktop version."
"I've used Techsmiths Snag and Camtasia Studio for over 5 years so when I saw this on sale I jumped on it for personal use.

I recently started a new job and the ability to use my key at work and at home is a huge benefit, its nice to find a company that doesn't punish users who purchase there software. There are many features that make this product shine above the rest, you just have to try it out yourself and see."
Norton Security is a very reliable and advanced AntiVirus/Malware Protection plan for your computer.  I love it!  I have done computer repair for over 25 years and that is all I use on my computer.  I have never gotten a virus.
"I needed to upgrade my Microsoft Office but i couldn't afford ""new"" upgrade so Amazon had this pre owned version. I was concerned that it was not going to work but everything was perfect. It was in original packaging, with all manuals just as if it was ""new"". Worked as promised, and delivery was on time. I am very pleased."
Easy to install and use.
Great product!
"I used to have different applications to run my small business, from invoicing, writing checks to banking. with Quickbooks I now have one and can import different bank accounts into quickbooks and track of my invoicing more efficiently."
NO COMMENT IN PARTICULAR.
"Years ago, Norton was the leader in anti-virus. They also had fantastic customer service, with actual English-speaking support personnel based in Sunny Southern California--both on the phones and online. Then they got too big not only for themselves but for average computers--bogging down operations to a crawl. (Maybe that was their way of avoiding viruses was to make the system inoperable...?) They shipped all support issues to Sunny India and it was rare you could get someone you could understand. I stopped using Norton at that point because in addition to losing their support, they slogged systems down horribly. So I was glad to hear a Fry's Electronics' employee recommend them because they were much faster than they'd been. True, they were, but they still dragged the system horribly. Pages that used to load in a snap now had a five-second or more lag time. Programs that used to run effortlessly now locked up, froze, and forced a hard shut down. Mysteriously, it would even swap my icons around, exhanging pictures of one for another. Add to that you have extremely little control over what runs and what doesn't. Plus, it simply didn't work on a basic level: I play online games and it couldn't prevent an advertising hijacker from forcing my browser to visit their game. Another knock was that Norton was too intrusive on your system and this continues. Not only did I have to use their foreign support people to remove a four-year-old version of Norton that was STILL on my system after all this time, but even THEIR OWN removal tool to remove 360 didn't work because a scan shows there are STILL remnants of 360 on my system. This is just about the worst Norton product I have seen and I've been working on computers for almost 30 years. Inexplicably, this once fine American product has gotten worse over they years, not better."
"The Mapsource TOPO product in theory has plenty of detail for what you use it for.  It has the equivalent of a 1:100,000 scale Topo map, showing major features, contour lines, trails, etc. It also provides additional streets, highways and roads that don't come on the Etrex Vista base map.
However, there is a major problem with the viewability of the topographical map information on the screen of your Etrex.  The Mapsource TOPO maps have some sort of background shading.  Perhaps this is color detail (e.g. green means vegitation).  The problem is that on the screen it is just dark grey.  With this dark gray background on your Etrex screen, you can barely, if at all, see any other map features, your route, waypoints or tracks.
Therefore, loading the Mapsource TOPO map on the Etrex practically renders the Map screen on the Etrex useless in the back country.  I found this out the hard way on a hike up in the mountains, when I really wanted to be able to make out what was on the map screen.
In case you think I just don't know how to adjust the screen contrast on my Etrex, I tried that, with some very minor improvement.
Other than uploading maps to your Etrex unit, you can use Mapsource TOPO to create routes and waypoints when you plan your hikes and then use the software to upload the data to your Etrex.  However, as an avid National Geographic TOPO user, I find these tools in Mapsource to be way less user friendly.  If what you really want is software to help you plan trips, routes, etc., you definitely need to buy National Geographic TOPO.
In summary, if I had to do it all again, I would save the [money] and not buy the Mapsource Topo product.

Could not get it to run.
Does the job well!
"Simple, effective and powerful antivirus software. Installed on three machines (two XP desktops and a Vista laptop), never experienced any issues or problems. Updates are fast and easy. There are two interfaces available, simple and expert view, and I used both (depending on task I am trying to execute).

Long story short, I am recommending this product to everybody."
"Since I have three different Garmin Nuvi devices; one of which they do not support updates online anymore (#350), I wanted to be able to only update maps once and then be able to put the updated information in the device I travel with the most.  Locally, I can suffice with the older maps.  When this SD card is put into the device used it works much more quickly and with more detail/choices especially for restaurants and fuel stops.  The fact that it included detailed maps of Canada AND Mexico was quite cool plus Puerto Rico (future trip).  I recommend this option for those who have multiple Garmin Nuvi devices with the SD card slot and who travel outside of their own home area often so that you will never be lost again. I will continue to support this less expensive option in the future as I do NOT like the one-time purchase of lifetime maps which come at a higher cost and only work on one device at a time.  What if Garmin decides to discontinue online support for a particular model?  (As has already happened, UGH!!)  Thank you Garmin for finally making this less expensive option available in the US!"
"I purchased Sketch Book Pro specifically for doing initial (draft) sketches of network diagrams, flow-charts, and other telecom engineering work. In the past I've found most drawing programs to either be lacking in features or far too complex to learn and use for simple sketches. What I needed was a program that could allow me to do a mix of vector object placement and drawing as well as free-hand sketching (with a Wacom tablet). Having tried many programs (like Iluustrator and Corel) I found them to be geared towards artists and designers as well they should be. I had resorted to using Microsoft OneNote (which I still use for other purposes) for sketches.

Sketch Book Pro offers the simplicity of doodle/sketching with some of the finer features of a mature drawing application such as pressure sensitive support and controls,support for gestures, flexible placement of pallets, etc.

In addition to these benefits it is a very reasonable price compared to other products. I do not use the painting features, but the pencil, marker, and other features are perfect for sketching and initial concept work. Compared to doing a first draft in Visio, freehand sketching a network design with Sketch Book Pro and the Wacom takes about 1/8th of the time.

I also use it for whiteboarding with engineers using desktop sharing with presentation/conferencing software."
"I just bought this product. Quicken Premier 2016 Personal Finance requires that you have an online account with Intuit. I am unable to log in using my current Intuit credentials (Unknown Error), nor am I unable to create a new login (Ooops, Something went wrong.) I just spent an hour on hold with customer support and I am disgusted.

Intuit, your support is an embarrassment. You failed to keep authentication servers up an available preventing us from using your software. Requiring your users sign in to your servers before allowing us to use your product is a poor decision on your part. I am going to get a refund and try one of your competitors products."
good
Could not install.  Could not use.  A total waste.  No.  No.  Do not buy!  Terrible.  Dare you to post this.  Unhappy
"This product is horrible.  I purchased in July 15, and this is the fourth time Lightroom says I now have a trial copy and wants my serial number, even though I have installed it and been using it for months.  When you are able to find a tech support number (Adobe makes it as difficult as possible), the person says either there is no tech support for the product or they can't help you as it is not a ""cloud"" product!!!  If you try to re-enter your purchased serial number from the package, it says you've exceeded to number of installs (2), and you must deactivate the product (which also does not work!!!).
Obviously, Adobe has really screwed up their product.  I am back using Lightroom version 5.5, as it doesn't have the licensing problems.

Avoid the Lightroom 6 product!!"
My laptop still infected
Quicken Essentials is a piece of junk. Amazon should be ashamed to sell this product. It is a blatant fraud. You can set up an account and download transactions. Other than that forget it. Want a budget report - 'it is not possible' according to the help desk chat person. Why go to the trouble of entering a budget if you can't use it anywhere. Net worth? Can't do it. The help desk says it is for beginning users. Unless you are a fourth grader you are better off with a ledger pad. Buy anything else but this. I have used Quicken (on the PC) for 20 years. Not more Intuit for me.
get the real deal
This was very disappointing.  It would not install on my MaBook Pro Laptop.  I returned it for a refund.
"Just a warning, Quicken has a sunset policy and they break their software after 2 years to force you to buy a newer version.  Seeing how this is the 2008 and it is now 2010, I think you can figure out what this means."
Word.
"The WriteItNow 4 software is an awesome writing tool that lets you quickly conceptualize your story, and speed up the production time. It installs in minutes on a Win 7 PC, and so far I have no complaints. The software is as expected. There are separate tabs for writing sections: characters, chapters, events, and history tips. The characters in the story come alive with the visual image that displays connection between characters, like brother, sister, enemy, and friend. There's also the ability to add an image of the character to the file. The character tap have a feature that let you easily control, and organize your characters personality attributes. The software is very responsive, no wait time while clicking around between tabs."
"Absolutely Horrible Item. It's not even worth twenty dollars! Very  cheaply made,  thin, and nothing to keep neck up. DO  NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
"I have used True Image 2010 to clone my laptop SSD to a larger SSD. The program did a good job of it and impressed me at that time. Later, I decided to use the the backup feature of the application. Now, that was a challenge and never materialized. The program started to give me errors and interrupt the backup process. The 2010 program was buggy and it appears that the 2011 version did not fix the bugs!

I emailed their customer service about the errors. They suggested I would delete an entry in the My Computer. I did that and tried the backup again. This time the program passed the last error fine but gave me a new error. I emailed them again and after some emails going back and forth from their customer desks in India they asked me if they could call me at home. I said yes, gave them a time to call me, the time came and gone and no phone calls!!! After a few more emails I gave up on their customer service and uninstall the program from my laptop.

Overall this program is very buggy for backup. However if you want to make a disk clone it should work."
The DVD Product is perfect as delivered which is the out of date 2008 version. It was advertised as the Current Map Set  with the 2009 Map Set Garmin Part Number. Disappointed in the accuracy and therefore the price.
"worked well would use Webroot and have again, may change next time though if they have too much hassle when re loading"
"I also have the Auralog Tell Me More Arabic and have only browsed through both of them a little bit (under an hour).  So far I am liking the Rosetta Stone's structure better so far (go online and do a demo of Spanish or something).  However, there is a big problem with Rosetta Stone; on one of my desktops and one laptop they both always have 100% CPU Usage, this is very annoying.  Although I have a Pentium M it still gets loud and very, very hot when running at 100%.  I would like to be able to use Dragon Naturally Speaking Pro 8 with it if it is possable, but with CPU at 100% it just crawls.  I hope there is a work around on this other wise I'll be forced to use Auralog's Tell Me More. I tried downloading Daemon Tools and set up a virtual CD-Rom drive and that doesn't do anything either."
"Although shipping was easy and I got the package, I am extremely annoyed it did NOT come with a product key so that I can install the product I JUST SPENT OVER A $100 DOLLARS ON"
Installed it myself over the XP. Works great and user friendly as it is almost like XP which I got so use to. Windows 7 was recommended by my friend who ownes a computer store for over 30 years.
"I was very disappointed with the performance of this software.  It would crash on a routine basis when doing even simple video clip editing.  It would even crash on occasion when I was trying to save my project.  Some of the clip transitions wouldn't work correctly.  After inserting a transition, I would go back to check how it looked, and the picture would freeze in mid-transition.  Another quirk would occur when I would bring the movie project up after having worked on it the previous day.  Random movie clips (that looked fine the day before, with transitions inserted and working without a problem) would be blacked out.  When I would try to cut them out to reinsert them, the program would crash (of course).  After struggling to complete my movie, I held my breath when hitting the burn button.  It seemed to be going along just fine for about twenty minutes, then crashed, ruining my blank blu-ray disc.  I'm officially giving up and will be going with a different software program.  Everyone working at Cyberlink should be embarrassed to be associated with this product.  Oh, and no, my problems were not due to my computer not being up to the task of creating and burning high definition video.  I just purchased a new Hewlett Packard for the main purpose of working with high-def, and the speed and memory far surpass the recommended requirements."
"I was unable to get a copy of this software in Australia so it was great that I could get it from USA.  I have an I-Mac G5 and the free Open Office software was usable, but M/S Office is so much better.  The delivery was OK, too."
Excellent program
Terrific Protection Software with some nice utility options as well....would not use anything else and i have tried Many over  the years.....
"Have used eset for years. Always only the basic versions (I don't need the massive amount of overprotection, just Anti-virus scans and malware).
This new version *really* slowed down my W7 startup and I haven't been able to turn off many of the probable options nor have they been able to help. However, it doesn't take up any more RAM or CPU cycles so there is still plenty have work power. After several minutes, it calms down and the PC is seemingly just as fast as it was.  Just takes those several extra minutes now to come back to life."
Love digital downloads as it takes only about 3 minutes!
with Ubuntu works fine
"Having found that Win 8 upgrade from Vista does not retain ANY of your applications, this was a smooth and simple upgrade that retained all applications."
"I was suspect about it working under Linux, however Wine pulled through.
I'm using Ubuntu.  I copied all the contents of the DVD and run it locally."
I love this
"I have used Corel Painter and Painter Essentials since 2008.  My first experience was Painter Essentials 3 or 4 (bundled with my Wacom Intuos 3 graphics tablet).  I used Painter X up until OSX Snow Leopard (10.6) ceased to run it (thank you for nothing Apple) and I upgraded my PC beyond 8GB of RAM.  Since then, I've been Painter-less and itching to get back into using it again.  While other programs come close, Painter has the best simulation of oil and other natural media.

I purchased Essentials 5 to get that back.  Unfortunately, it won't even install on my Windows 7 Pro workstation.  Windows installs go through a browser based setup and use Active X controls.  Despite my best efforts to turn these off, and make myself vulnerable to malware while doing so, the Windows installation never gets beyond the browser window ""Loading""

So I went and installed it on my late 2009 iMac 20 inch running OS 10.9.5 and it installed and ran just fine.  Not that I mind that Mac, but its only got 4GB of RAM and a 128 MB ATI video card compared to the 16GB of RAM and 1GB NVIDIA on my workstation running Windows.  This limits the images and workflow.

Lesson learned, don't bother with Corel products.  They still don't know how to produce quality user friendly software.  This will be my final Corel product ever.  I will save my money for their competitors (take Smith Micro putting out Manga Studio for example, you can still Manga Studio 4 Windows or Mac, and it's the contemporary of Corel Painter X which is now a coaster on my desk collecting dust and coffee stains).

On the plus side, the brushes look very natural, and it does work.  Just not where I needed it to."
"Does what it says it will do. but caution, still proof read."
"Received it in about a week.  Directions are simple.  Usage was really easy.  Be aware that if the VHS is 20 minutes long, it will take a few more minutes to burn it on the DVD.  Worked great, played back well (used the slowest speed for better picture)."
"I have been using Trend Micro products for 15 years and have never had a single issue or problem. I highly recommend Trend Micro Titanium Maximum Security that wants real protection and awesome performance.  I recently joined the world of Android and installed Trend Micro Mobile Security on my phone. I have a license for 3 PCs which allowed me to use one of those on my phone using the same key for installation to get the full version of Mobile Security and the expiration is the same for both items, understandably. So far, I am extremely impressed with Trend's Mobile App also."
"Have not been able to get it to work.  Can only call customer service through the week when I am at work and my computer and disk are at home.  The semester, in which I purchased the SPSS disk to help me with a graduate statistics course, is over.  I didn't do as well as I would have liked on assignments, tests, and the final exam, because I didn't have the disk to practice with."
The grandkids love this movie. All in fun.
very good
Great timing on shipping. Works greato. Highly recommended
"This is a fantastic game for kids and their Leapster Explorer or LeapPad! My 6 year old asked me for help finding something in one of the riddles, and ever since, we sit down every night now and do the searches together! Fun, fun game, and it is great for those who love the old search and find books for kids. Great game!!"
"I'm in a free efile state for state return filing and think the product should allow the same.  in other words, turbotax and state filing options should ""talk"""
could not find a way to do several things listed on the tool bar
"I have been using TaxCut for over 20 years now. This software has the same quality as TaxCut but with H&R Block's brand name. It is excellent and I highly recommend it. Doing my tax return was a breeze. I e-filed my Federal return and got my refund within 4 days of filing. I did not e-file my state return because I still refuse to pay 19 bucks to get my state refund. However, the option was there to do so. If one is so inclined to get their state refund back in a hurry, this program makes it easy as can be. I will purchase it again next year. I give it 5 stars."
"I bought this for a 4th grader in advanced math.  To be frank, the software is boring.  You can be lectured to in one program or take quizzes in another.  There's no interactivity - kids will become tired of this software quickly.  The publishers quality control is lax too - one screen showing topics to be quizzed on listed ""Additionition"" among its offerings.

The grade range says grades 4-12 but it has concepts (like addition) suitable for lower grades.  Kids in those lower grades will find the software even more boring.

I had no trouble installing the software and running it under Vista, though it takes a really long time to install and uninstall.  I'm returning this software - don't make the same mistake I did and skip this product (I bought it in a store on impulse...no reviews to guide me.)"
"I upgraded from 2011 to 2013 and have been somewhat disappointed.  It could be that I'm running into launch bugs that will be worked out over time, but as of right now (January 2013) I'm rather frustrated.

After upgrading none of my custom reports function anymore.  Even when you go in and re-select the proper categories / accounts in the saved custom report it won't display any data.  You have to re-create your report from scratch (mirroring exactly the non-functional existing report), and for some reason this new report will work whereas the old one won't.  Frustrating.

Also a little frustrating is the fact that my checking accounts won't stay in the proper category.  I have two separate checking accounts linked with investment accounts (one account for a rental property and another account tied to a brokerage account).  For some reason every time I log in to Quick these two accounts are now listed under ""Banking"" instead of under ""Investments"" where they used to be.  I keep moving them back but every time I log into Quicken they're back under ""Banking"".

One minor irritant is you no longer have the ability to view balances in the ""Accounts"" bar but exclude them from totals.  This is something I had been doing with education savings plans as well as accrued cash value on life insurance policies.  It was nice to see the sudden jump in net worth when I upgraded, but since it is artificial it's irritating.

The bright spot is that Quicken now appears to update my mortgage balance as part of the auto update, which it wouldn't before.  The downside is that although it downloads things properly for my primary residence, it won't show transaction detail on the mortgage for my rental property.  You can go into settings and see a check box you should be able to uncheck to show transaction level detail, however it's grayed out, so all you see is a little pie chart and the total remaining.

I did try to call customer service which was strange.  You have to submit your issue online, and when you think you're done they just give you a case number and a phone number you can call.

I've gone through this twice, the first time I contacted customer service was to question the reports and I was told that you just have to recreate those.  Not exactly what I wanted to hear after hours spend perfecting about two dozen reports.

As I found the other apparent bugs I tried to contact customer service a second time.  I submitted everything online and then called the number.  After sitting on hold for 22 minutes waiting for someone to pick up, I heard a click then silence as my call was disconnected.

The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because I've been a loyal Quicken user since 2000, and it really is a great product and is fantastic for managing your personal finances.  Quicken 2013 still seems to have some issues however, so for now only two stars.  I should have stayed with Quicken 2011."
"The software is generally ok.  BUT, the customer support is horrible.  They have a known issue with the software that has not been fixed and they refuse to fix it.  It has to do with IRS Form 8962 and the Affordable Care Act. If you want to do a shared allocation, you cannot do a 100% and 0% allocation.  It came up when I was preparing my taxes this year and my daughter's taxes.  I spent about 5 hrs total chatting with 2 separate tax advisers online and with a third technical support person.  Finally, they escalated the issue.  Then when they called me back, I wasn't at home and I had to call them.  Of course the hold time was about 40 minutes.  Then the call took another 30 minutes and he couldn't resolve the issue.  He said he would call me back.  He did.  He said that it is definitely a software issue and it wasn't going to be fixed this year.  My options are to do a different allocation or to paper file.  To top this off, H&R Block offices have the same glitch in their software, because I went to an office to try and get this done that way, but they end up having the same issue.  It is a unique situation that doesn't come up often but nonetheless it is very poor that they don't have software that you can trust."
I returned the program since it did not include all the schedules needed for investments.
"I purchased this this morning.  Downloaded it.  I made sure it was the right one for my operating system--it was.  And when I got it successfully registered--NOTHING.  It didn't work at all.  I did everything their meager instructions said I should.  It didn't download squat.

I tried contacting their tech support page--and the ""SUBMIT"" button didn't work.  Isn't that convenient?  And if you want to try contacting Wondershare by phone--guess what?--it's all the way in China!!!

I'm appalled at Amazon for selling this.  I have trusted them to back legitimate companies.

However, I'm grateful that Amazon is refunding me for this travesty.  I just hope in the future, that they do a better job of screening their companies."
I've been a loyal supporter of Trend micro for over 10 years... Very well done antivirus.
"Maybe I haven't really given iWork a chance. As a lifelong user of Microsoft Word, I hesitated before changing. I don't use word processing much lately but have tried to use iWork for making tables and for importing other (non-iWork) documents into the program and working with them. I still haven't gotten the hang of it, although I sometimes succeed. And as far as sending these iWork documents to others without the program, it's been a bit of a hassle, too.

Sometimes the program seems non-intuitive, although this might just be my reaction to the non-Microsoft Word program. In any case, I would like to make it work. So give this a B minus with a possible upgrade to an A plus for the future."
"This is the best program I've used for designing rooms.  It is not for blueprints or detail in wiring etc.  It is for drawing a room to size and then working with different types of furniture, paint and fabrics, to get an idea of what will fit in the designated space as well as how it will look when completed.  The capability of switching back and forth between 2D and 3D is wonderful - just a click each way.  The camera height and angle can be moved so if you're trying to see an overall view of a small room, the camera can be re-angled for that purpose. This program is simple to use and has a lot of furniture and features to use to decorate a room.  There's art work to hang on the walls and different appliances to incorporate into the kitchen.  If it has a downfall, I would say that there isn't enough in the way of ""extras"" such as hanging plants, small appliances for the kitchen such as toasters, blenders and condiment jars.  Also, although there are a lot of colors for painting the walls, in reality, there's not that wide a range.  Overall though, this program is easy to learn, and easy to use.  It is capable of changing the size of items in the work screen rather than having to re-enter new measurements.  I have used this program for years, and was devastated when I lost the disc.  I was immensely pleased to find it again on Amazon.com."
"If you are looking for the best Antivirus program, each person/company has there own story about why XYZ is better than the rest. I have used pretty much any Antivirus program out there both at personal and business level. There are some good comparison articles on the web that compare Trend Micro with Symantec and McAfee. You will find viruses and spyware that Trend will find that Symantec may not, ones that Symantec will find that Trend will not, visa versa. I actually dropped Symantec cause it did not detect a virus that got onto my computer. I ended up having to reinstall Windows, and then loaded Trend on it. I actually plugged in a thumb drive that apparently still had the virus on it and Trend caught it. It did not clean it but it still notified me that it saw it.

I also switched to Trend cause it usually is cheaper than the other major vendors, it is easier to use IMHO. It has its short comings, but so does the other vendors. One particular thing on Trend Micro is the alert messages you get on changes being made to your computer (like your home page on IE changing) does not actually tell you what is changing, just prompts you to allow or disallow. On most occasions I know what was occuring at the time the message appeared so I can answer appropriately.

With the spyware side, I did not buy this product for that. If you think you have spyware go download Spybot, it's the best spyware scanner out there and it's free. Trend's attempt is decent and it will mostly tell you if something is trying to change a setting or add a file that looks suspicious but I don't think it is going to catch everything out there. Spybot is something I've used that works best for spyware once you think you have been infected by it. The newer versions of Spybot might have preventive scans or warnings but I have not used in for a while. The best defense against spyware, know where you are going on the Internet. If you download every little thing out there cause ""it's cool"" then you are bound to get spyware eventually."
"Old software.  Nice idea but will they ever clean this up? This is the second version of ACT I purchased, good idea but needs some Agile project management, perhaps from the ground floor up. Cheers sj."
I am very disappointed in this game.  It malfunctions even though I downloaded the fixes for all the games.  It is not as good as Ghost Stories which I highly recommend.
"Has nice features. Harder than Windows media player but once your past the learning curve, it's pretty easy to make videos for YouTube."
This is the worst program I have ever used.  Could not update lost return. Go back to Turbotax!
The software worked well for our application.  This was purchased because we needed the 32 bit software for some applications we were using on the server.
"arrived on time, worked as promised. super quick download. glad to have office."
Everything was fine. Sofeware is very good.
"While creating a backup, it destroyed my disk.  This is the worst behavior I can imagine.

Creating the backup, it froze.  Then, it would not boot Windows.  Ghost had put its own boot blocks on the disk, build another partition, wrote itself into that partition, and would not boot windows.  You could boot to Ghost, but it would just freeze or fail in booting windows.

In the end, I had to format and rebuild the disk ...

(Windows repair did not work.  The system would not boot after repair, and repair did extensive damage.)"
"Difficult to contact via ""Contact Us"""
Great
"Just did not fit my needs.  My computer crashed & I had to replace my money program, so I ordered the 2007 version thinking it might be an improvement.  It was an improvement but not what I needed.  I prefer to controll my own entries, rather than have them done by automation.  My background is accounting, so I don't need help in that area.  I am sure there are the younger generation that would appreciate this kind of help, but it just is not for me."
"This version is slightly better. I think there is a free trial version to try before making the leap, it might be best to try that before investing in this.
While the dash is decent, and the auto uninstall is good, there wasn't much difference despite the 'clean-up'.
While I did not expect a miracle, it was just ok."
"I needed Antivirus and I was able to get a great one at the best price EVER, this was the best 8 bucks I ever spent.

Moreover the product has already identified 12 Trojans on my lap top and external drive so it is an excellent product"
"Full performance expired today. I bought it December 21, 2014. It took a week for the disk to arrive. I got about 30 days use out of it. For another $46+, I can get pro back. Other than the  advertisement of AVG Ultimate 2015 for 2 YEARS--the product performed well on Windows 7. It seemed to always find internet cache to clean even if I first deleted IE and Chrome browser history. It did not clean C:\Users\User Name\AppData\Local\Temp folder. You still have to do that manually. After AVG clean-up, cleanmgr.exe still found a few thumbs and data to delete.

I'm not inclined to pay $46/month for AVG Ultimate. I'll keep using AVG Free or MS Security Essentials."
Why does Amazon charge more to download this product than to ship the cd? I cannot fathom why this would be so.
The interface is plain Jane. No bells or whistles.  I deleted it and went back to Avast.
"I use it every year gets better every year shorter and to the point
It should be cheaper its the only reason i gave it 4 stars"
"Accountants who use this product need to be aware of a few things. First, the annual closing apparently does not involve closing the P&L balances and writing the net amount into a retained earnings account. However, it appears to be done if you look at the next year to date, so maybe that does not matter. What does matter is that you should set a closing date which denies access to a prior closed period unless the person is properly authorised. Quickbooks appears to do this under password control which if it worked would be good. In my case, the confirm password field was grayed out so I could not confirm it. More serious still I called Quickbooks to point out this apparent bug only to be told by someone who ominously identified himself as Mike 07 (James Bond type?) that to get this solved I needed to buy the support package. I asked for his boss and was put on hold for 20 minutes or so until they hung up. In summary, there is a looseness in Quickbooks in relation to accounting controls, systems integrity and professionalism, the software is quite easy to learn and use, but the support appears to be as uncompromisingly unfriendly as Microsoft's. Further Mike 07 had a strange accent that was really difficult to understand. Accountants should be very careful about whom they allow access to in the system and regularly print out last years balance sheet and compare it with the one they used to file their returns. I also noticed that quite frequently the underlying ledger, say AP or inventory, showed a balance that differed from the amount shown on the balance sheet. A journal entry will correct this but it is disconcerting. Again you should worry about the systems internal controls or at least I did and still do."
"I never use it. Open office is free and more useful to me. Get it if you must, but I have not found it that useful."
I am somewhat disappointed as it malfunctions sometimes.
"Out of all the software included the Will Maker is by far the best. As for the other CDs which include Trust Maker, Library, and Personnel Finance are all pretty  much useless in my opinion. I couldn't get Library and the trust maker to work, contacted Quicken and they said trust maker is no longer supported. I got this for the will making so I was too disappointed that the other features didn't work.

The other negative was that I was thinking this would be typing and clicking information and I would have a will in no time. Although this did save me money over hiring a lawyer, it also required a lot of leg work on my part contacting various financial institutions that I am invested and each of them have a different process.

It also isn't a one size fits all in that I couldn't customize it as well as I would have wanted to. It works, but looking back and into the future I think I will use a lawyer and pay the extra next time."
"I BOUGHT THIS TO REPLACE MY PREVIOUS HALLMARK SOFTWARE THAT WOULD NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS XP AND NO DRIVERS WERE AVAILABLE. THIS NEW SOFTWARE INCLUDES CARDS I HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT IN THE HALLMARK STORE. WHAT I LIKED MOST ABOUT MY PREVIOUS SOFTWARE WAS CREATING MY OWN CARDS, BUT THE CLIPART IN THIS VERSION IS TERRIBLE.  IT LOOKS LIKE TODDLERS DREW IT. IT DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO EMAIL CARDS AND ADD MUSIC WHICH IS NICE, BUT I MOSTLY BOUGHT IT TO MAKE CARDS AT HOME SINCE I HAVE TROUBLE GETTING TO THE STORE AND I AM DISAPPOINTED COMPARED TO MY PREVIOUS HALLMARK SOFTWARE.  IF I COULD GET THE DRIVER FOR IT, I WOULD GO BACK TO IT. I COULD HAVE USED THAT SOFTWARE FOREVER."
very easy to install.  Not a problem and did not have to bk up much at all before I did it
"Is everything I expected, very accurate  works well, would recommend this product to my friends."
Fantastic program for quick book beginners. Videos in small segments for coming back to review topic later.
as it was described!!!
don't do it
"I downloaded this Corel PaintShop Pro X8 on one computer, and I purchased this disc from Amazon.  I recommend getting it this was.  For some reason it never works as well when downloaded. I have 3 different types of photo programs, and this is my favorite."
Great addition to Amazon Prime
It was so easy and far less expensive than an accountant.  I got back as much as I usually do and found it very user friendly!  I recommend this to everyone!
Cannot really clean up all spyware but it did help.
"I received this the other day, opened the box and installed.  I have no experience in video editing and within a shot time I added a motion loop, text, transitions and a sound track.  No learning curve here.  Check back for an update as soon as I play alittle more."
I used this to calibrate my HP monitor and have now upgraded to ColorMunki Photo which calibrates my Epson printer to the monitor resulting in great prints.
"My 10 year old computer works almost like new .It can't use all the latest browsers, etc
Sellers were very helpful when I had some problems with installation."
I found the service today to be very helpful. The service provider was polite and took the time out to understand what I was trying to say the problem was with my computer.
This product is ok; but not as much as the full version. I got it to make cards for my grandchildren who live out of state.
"I used on my computer, it does updates automatically. If u want your tax's done, turbo tax is the best way you can go."

"[...]the Calc. Assistant I bought from you is the absolute best software on the market that money can buy.  Not only does it help you specifically with Calculus, but it carefully guides you through specific topics of Algebra and Pre-Calc as well.  Plus, it will guide you through any problem you can think of, with all the algebraic and higher math steps involved!  I never knew how much help I needed with group factoring until I bought your program!  I've bought Mathematica and Calculus Wiz and they're nothing compared to your ingenius exercises you've devised for the math enthusiast.  Ease of use and straightforwardness is additionally an invaluable advantage."
Old software- made for windows 98.  Low quality grafics.  Will not install on XP or Vista without problems.  Hard to use and navigate.  I do not recomend it.
"This is a great product!  I do a lot of hiking and off-roading out here in the Big Bend region of Texas, and have installed this product on my little netbook and take it with me whenever I go into the back-country.  I still take my paper topo maps with me, but the Topo 8.0 is what I turn to first!"
"I've used it for years. This year it got a little confused with one of the K-1's I had. It said I had duplicate descriptions for box 16 when there were none. I managed to work around the problem. Other than that it's super easy to use. I just wish it would handle printing out forms a better when doing double sided printing. If a form has an odd number of pages, double sided printing should insure a blank page is used instead of printing some other form."
"I bought Band in a box, after reading about it on both ebay, and amazon, and their home page. I bought band in a Box 2012, Mega Pak, for about $205.  I read the 300 pg owners manual at least 3 times, underlining, highlighting.  Finally I set out to compose some tunes, and I had some very surprisingly good results. From all appearances, this is one product that seemed to be over-delivered, and by that, I mean despite its hokey name whoi9ch put me off to almost not buying it, I thought the makers of BB had actually done a good job at the software, and the owners manual.
Now, here is the Dark cloud that goes with that silver lining:
If you get this version, with mega pac, about 1/2 of the ""Styles"" will not be available. Also, many of the drum track are likewise, unavailable. WHY? Doesn't MEGA PAK mean anything? Well, not when you compare it to ULTRA  PAK, which has ALMOST everything, and for about what I figure to be only about $35. More. But, here is the rub. You buy BB with mega pak, decide you really7 would like to NOT keep having those pop up windows, stating, ""File not found... style not found..."" or ""Drum track not available for this style..."", and you then come to the conclusion that you SHOULD have bought the most complete STYLE collection (ULTRA PLUS PAK), they will sell you not just the additional styles, but you also have to BUY the BB software all over again!  Well, thats fine for their bottom line: MONEY, but what do you now do with TWO BB softwares? To UPGRADE, they require you to buy the second BB software, which, you ALREADY HAVE, and to buy a second one, is redundant, not useful at all, and just more money.
The best thing you can do, is buy BB WITH the Ultra Plus Pak, containing almost ALL of the styles. When i was on their website, thanks to a link they gave me, I listened to a huge list of styles. I wrote down all the ones I was interested in, went back into the software, onoly to find, I did NOT HAVE almost ALL of the best choices, because I ""should have bought ultra pak!""  And since the company does not allow for you to only upgrade the styles, but FORCES you to buy an additional copy of the software, (WHICH I ALREADY HAD IN THE FIRST PLACE), I can only say you will be very limited if you do not buy at least the ultra pak of styles.  In addition, the package I got, also comes with ""REAL BAND"" which looks like a cut down version of Band in a Box user interface, but I found no documentation for it, to tell you what is is useful for.
I got a good deal, price wise, from The Midi Store, in the LA area. But they do NOT give you the same kind of customer support as the Home company. But even contacting BOTH of them, neither one would sell me the Upgrade to the ultra pak, without me HAVING TO BUY YET A SECOND copy of band in a box, so, if I did that, what use is it to HAVE two copies of the SAME SOFTWARE???? Why should they make you buy that second copy, knowing it is useless?  They made no effort to comfort me on that issue!!!!! So, that act alone made me STOP recommending this software to many of my musical friends. It just didn't make any sense at all, to be forced to buy something over and beyond what I needed.  So, if you want to buy band in a box, do yourself a big favor and make sure you at least get the ultra pak 2012 version, or else, half of what you probably will want to do, will be unavailable, as I found out only AFTER my purchase/installation/ and actual trial and error.  I do like what i did buy, but now that I see how it really is, I am pretty disappointed that I did not have this clear of an idea BEFORE I bought this product, and if I were to do it again, I'd get the Ultra Plus Pak, MINIMUM. Nothing less than that.  I have had great fun, with my LIMITED edition, but I have to say, even though they do deliver a great deal of fun even in the version I bought, their customer support comes up quite short of what the rest of the product actually is."
"Exactly what others have said, be prepared to shell out more money for a membership if you expect your child to actually be able to progress through the badges. We had a technical issue with the game and had to contact their support department, took five days for them to send us the file we needed to replace in order to get the game working again.  Also be aware that there is no button or link on their website to allow you to opt out or cancel your account, you must cancel via the phone (another treat: getting through to them on the phone) or email and hope that your cancellation goes through before the next billing cycle. This particular company will never get another penny from me."
"The soft ware was fine but it would only let me install it on two of my computers, if I had known that, I could have down loaded it for less money. I now have disc that is no good unless I buy another one."
"Bad Product! Incurs much more tax!
I used both ""H&R Block Tax Software"" and ""H&R Block Online Tax Preparation"" to see if there is any tax difference.
It ends up with $354 more tax liabilities when using the tax software!
Now I learn that cheap product may cost you more. Totally wasted my money."
It is a little coplicated to figure out all of the things it will do.  But when I have time I think it will be awesome.
"The old way is better where I could just download everything to a file called amazon mp3 and do what I want with it. Now getting the music into my computer so I can simply drag and drop it into my portable mp3 player is like pulling teeth. I just want to give up. On the positive side if you want to steam off the cloud to a device like an IPhone it is EASY TO DO! I would like to be able to cut and copy a music selection from the main list of play list and drag and drop it to my mp3 player or second hard drive for backup like you do with any other computer file. If this flaw is fixed I would give the 5 stars. A later update, i did figure out how to import the music to the amazon mp3 file, but it would be nice if you could drag and copy or drop the playlists to a portable mp3 player plunged into the usb port."
This is easy to use software with fantastic tech support with quick response. Highly recommend especially for the non technical person.
"Necessary for every college student, but it take some time to get used to the new menus and options and lag is unavoidable."
"The product description  claims it has everything you need to convert your VHS to DVD. However, what they don't tell you is that you need a VCR and a computer or a laptop. This is too time consuming, for me. . Instead, I found a REAL ""all-in-one"" that allows you to just put the old VHS tape in one side, the DVD in the other side and press the start button, and go do other things while it converts the movies."
"Worked quick and a quick return on my investment.

I found the product to be out standing and well up to date"
"The software was very inconsistant. (Used on PC with XP Service pack 2 high level of multi media performance) especially in the ""Plug and Burn"" phase if you did not want to capture and edit the video.  It would capture less then 50% of the time through a 50 minute DV tape. Unfortunately, sometimes you were 80% through the capture tape when it begins to fail.  Out of 10 captures, only 4 worked from begining to end the other 60% failed; leaving for much re work, frustration let alone hours of unproductive time.  The software needs to go back to the drawing board."
Works well as advertised.
What a great way to read and study your Bible!! The ancient maps will bring you closer to your ancestors.
"Don't even bother buying this software. I have used The Print Shop for years and was really excited to upgrade to this version. What a waste of money! I tried to create Christmas address labels, merging them with the address book that's included, and every time I tried to print the labels, the software crashed and shut down the program. I restarted the computer but that did not solve the problem. I, then, uninstalled Print Shop, and reinstalled it from my Amazon software library, and it still did not work right. At least, I still have Print Shop 22 and it works! This was very disappointing and frustrating!"
"I loved Snagit 7 and 8. I've always been a fan of this product, and working in technical support, I can honestly say I use this software every day - for troubleshooting and documentation. I upgraded to version 9 after I used the trial version for a week. The trial version was very slow, but I assumed that was due to it being ""trial"". I assumed the paid version would be much faster. I was wrong. Press the ""Print Screen"" key, and sit back. Versions 7 & 8 were instantaneous. Version 9 takes a full two seconds to begin capturing, and then another two seconds to launch the ""Editor"". Also, in version 8, all my captures saved as JPG. In 9, they save as PNG. Why isn't there a setting to allow users to set the default file type? Finally, the ""capture history"" feature might be useful for some folks, but I find it very annoying, and wish there was some way to disable it. I would honestly wait until version 9.1 or until Techsmith works on the speed issues at least."
"Needed a newer version of Quickbooks for the new laptop. This works fine, but looks so different from the old version that some things are difficult to figure out. I know that they feel like they have to make it look like they are making substantial changes, but there is some value in making things easy for the user."
"I upgraded my 2010 version of Quicken Premier to the 2012.  I am very disappointed in the new version.  First, the font is much larger and I cannot get as much on the screen.  There is no way to reduce the font smaller than 8 - only make it larger.  The screen in the 2010 was much better.

More importantly, I have used it for 4-5 days and it worked fine.  But now it will not download any of my financial activities - it just shows me the little revolving ball.  When I try to quit the download or the program its self it won't let me.  I have to end the program through task manager.

Since it removes the 2010 version and loads the 2012 version I cannot go back to the older version."
"Software is fine once you download direct from Adobe! Wasted 4 days, 6 downloads on three computers before reading reviews to find I was not alone in being unable to install. Like other said...just use the serial number Amazon gives you and DO NOT download from Amazon because it simply does not work!"
"They need to put this in the description so that someone without Leopard won't buy it. I tried the beta of this, and really liked it. I have used FileMaker, but don't really need the power for most things. I still use AppleWorks for most of my database needs. This is the first program that comes close to filling the void they left when they decided to abandon AW."
It was easy to download and easy to use. I will use it again next year!
I like the converting conversion tool feature in his program
This product would not run on any of my computers. I followed the instructions and it would not work. The DVD was replaced and the replacement did exactly the same thing as the first. I really don't think much of this product.
"Definitly worthwhile... used it to teach my 10 year-old son C#. Needed to do very little adjunct teaching as the programmed lessons are clear, concise, and easy to understand."
"This is the best program for the money. My college have the same software,

so having this program at home means no waiting for an editing suite."
"I spent a long time waiting on a non 800 number for a little help with this program.  After finally getting a real person, he didn't even know what I was talking about.  After an hour on the phone where he did ""research"" the problem was not resolved and he had no idea how to even identify it to resolve it. I spent money (phone bill) and time for nothing.  The program itself is pretty good if you don't ever need any help because they don't have a help service on the CD, it just tells you to go to Windows which doesn't help with business card questions.
I would like to add that since I switched to Windows 7, I have had nothing but problems with this softward even though calling them (much confusion there) ended up with them telling me that it was fully compatable.  I would not purchase this software again.  It is difficult to use and to figure out."
I am now able to solve Algebra problems step by step with Algebrator this has been a great experience I would recommend this software to my friends.
my computer likes it
"I downloaded this program from Amazon and tried to use it to migrate my files from XP to Windows 7.  You need to read the documentation on how to upgrade a single PC.  The program creates a list of programs, files, and registry settings to migrate.  After you install Windows 7, reinstall the program and let it migrate your stuff.  For 90 percent of the programs, it works just fine."
Love it.
REturned as this product would not work with Windows 8.1
"I do a lot of upgrades, and build my own PC's.  XP Pro is one of the best and stable OS's I have ever used."
We've used Turbo tax for several years now.  The downloadable purchase option is even easier than the disk. In minutes our software downloaded and we were on our way to getting the taxes done with a maximum refund.
Could not even download it. Not here and not anywhere else. Safe your time for something that's worth it. This is not it.
i listen to my amazon albums all the time ... very convenient
"Having had a hard drive failure years ago, I realized that a real test required that I actually buy and install a new hard drive and determine whether the product lives up to its claims. I needed a full system backup anyway since many of my applications are upgrades to previous products (eg. VB-4, to VB-5, to VB6, upgrades of Excel and Access and so on) and the intallation on a new computer took a full 2 weeks to set up.  I have a factory installed Western Ditgital Diamond Caviar 500 gb HD on a Dell Inspiration 530 Vista 64 bit OS. I am evaluating Acronis True Image Home 2009.
It took 6 backups (5 failed -not caused by Acronis) and many many hours before I finally wound up with a set of reliable backup dvd disks. If you have a boxed copy of Acronis, you can use their installation CD as the boot disk. I created an additional bootable installation disk to make sure the bootable wizard works.
I suggest that anyone wanting to tackle this chore not make my first mistake: backing up to 'write once' disks.  My first attempt was a sector by sector backup requiring 12 dvds.  On my first try and after 3 1/2 hours the last disk (disk 12) -the machine hung. I had to reboot. Acronis attempted to continue what it was doing. Windows loaded again and Acronis informed me that it had finished. Having spent all of this time on disks that could not be written to again, I decided to swap in the new drive and try anyway. I ended up with a semi-functional OS, a corrupt registry, and a version of VB troubled by the corrrupt registry. The installation took almost 3 hrs. The next day I used the Validate function in Acronis - it told me the backup archive was corrupt and caused by poor quality of the backup media (the dvd disks). Only then did I realize the folly of not using DVD RW. 5 more installations and many many hours and a week later and I finally have a working set of backup disks. I had to discard 3 dvds in the process. One lesson - if you don't use the Validate function in Acronis to test the backup, you are wasting your time. For backups I am using Verbatim DVD+RW media. Several of the dvd disks had to be discarded when Acronis reported that the newly created backup archives were corrupt due to poor media quality (at 1st I didn't think the media might be problematic). Certainly it would be discouraging after spending many hours or days creating a backup only to discover when needed, it really wasn't a backup after all.

I do have a suggestion for Acronis. The Validate function should be able to validate sequentially each of the disks as the backup archive is being built. Presently you can validate the archive only after the whole archive is built. If the 4th or 5th disk out of say 12 or so is defective, you won't find out until the last disk is made and the Validate function has read each of the disks starting again with #1. When you get a failure error while validating that particular disk then you'll know that disk has to be tossed-but then you have to start again w/ disk 1. I have a hunch the other programs are similar. Wouldn't it be better if you were notifed while backing up to a particular dvd that it was faulty so you could skip it, substitue a new dvd and keep going. ALSO, if you have a large HD to back up, CREATE a MIRROR image instead of a sector by sector backup. There is a huge difference in the size and the amount of time spent. Validating the archive will take about the same amount of time as creating the archive. When I finally created a successful backup, the install went quickly - approx 1 1/2 hours to restore & without a hitch.  The lesson from my vantage point is buy a new hard drive before your current hard drive fails and test until you are confident you have a realiable set of backup dvds. If you don't want to use the new HD right away, seal it in a baggie, then insert it into another baggie w/ rice to absorb any moisture and keep it in a cool place. I have not significantly evaluated the other features. One other note: there is a small timing error I came across when using the backup OS (wizard if you like) to load the backup archive. When I inserted the DVD into the optical tray, depending on when I shut the bay and pressed RETRY, sometimes the RETRY button would not work. Clicking on the BROWSE button and reloading the archive allowed the restoration to continue.
-2wks later- I can report that the Clone Disk wizard (HD to another HD) located in the Utilities menu worked without a problem. It deleted the old partitions on the new test drive and created a new working bootable drive (this was a test again as there are no problems with my primary drive) easily and quickly.
-In a much later test of the DVD backup I made, I found a backup archive that previously worked, now backed up but with significant flaws. My thought is that the problem with the backup was caused by the DVD media. I'll try again later to see if magnetic media is more reliable.

Two other issues & I am still learning to work with this product.
-Using disk cleanup to securely delete a large file .9 gigs causes the cleanup window progress bars to stop working. You can't tell whether anything is happening. I let it alone for 15 minutes, came back and it appeared to have done nothing. Actually it had deleted the file. Without working progress bars there is no way to know when and whether it finishes.
-There is no way to download a fix from the application. I would expect Acronis to remedy the above problem. But the software should periodially check for fixes. It does not.

Best of luck."
"I knew from the reviews this software has issues, but figured it would be ok for my uses. NOT. It's good for NOTHING when even simple text is blurry, not mention pictures or clipart.
Honestly, it made me mad considering I got it to make memorial cards, which is a time sensitive project. Running to return it late night was not in the plans.
This program is Junk."
Great product at an affordable price!
"Love it.

"Needing to make some brochures for my business, I purchased this software against my better judgment.  It wasn't as if I didn't know better.  I had an earlier version I purchased in the 90's which I had found to be difficult to use.  But as I looked at the glossy pictures on the box, and read how wonderful this product purported to be I said to myself, ""Surely, this product must be better than it was.""

Well, I am here to tell you that it is just as difficult to use today as it was in the 90's.  Granted, I am not software geek, but I have been around the block a few times.  I think I am reasonably experienced in using software (Publisher, Word, FrontPage, Excel, etc.), but I cannot make this software do what I need it to do.  For instance, I want to paste a picture in a text box.  No problem, except for the text has to be manually manipulated around the picture.  Oh, by the way, the clip art is just as bad as it was ten years ago.  If you insist on buying this product, buy the very basic product and get your images off the web."
"""Super fast scans, always up to date, customer service beyond belief, protection for everything and low cost too. I can't come up with enough words to say how satisfied I am. Just purchase it and know that they have your back"

"The most pathetic excuse I have ever seen for customer service. After regretfully paying (in advance) with a credit card, I was provided with a number to call and a PIN number to use. When I attempted to call the number, I was never connected with anyone EXCEPT a telephone company recording that ""my call did not go through"" this continued for 2 days. When I called the customer support number (at my own cost) to ask for a good number for Technical Support, I was on hold for 30 minutes before I got a chance to speak to a representative. When someone answered the phone, I was told to use the same 900 number that was recited over and over while I was on hold. I refused to accept that because I had contacted the web site previously and would have ended up paying TWICE for a service that should be provided for free. It was at this point the fellow on the other end asked me what number I was trying to call previously. When he told me that the number provided by their website was incorrect, I wanted to reach through the telephone lines and, well I'll let you use your imagination.... It's pretty obvious that McA FEE doesn't care at all about support, and if they can't even do something as simple as give a good number on  their website, how can they fix their own darned program. I'm from St. Louis and I would try to fly by jumping off the top of the Gateway Arch before I would give McA FEE one more cent! If you purchase their product after reading about this experience, you deserve every bit of trouble you encounter."
"This is what we use for taxes, but I am tiring of the ads inside for their products. I also don't like the fact that it seems to need continual updating. Almost every time I open this, it does a few minutes of updates. Then there is the second guessing of decisions made by the user, especially on filing. I don't want offers from TT or Intuit throughout.

Why not just deliver a solid product, presume that the consumer knows, and leave the marketing people outside?"
"Now, it won't transfer Timeslips ecenter slips.  You  will get one token email a day asking you mostly irrelevant questions.  The worst Customer Support of any program ever in the world!

I believe the  5* saccharin reviews are staged by people connected to the company.  They are totally inaccurate.

When you set aside a non-court day for billing once a month, and they have changed something about the program w/o telling customers, it means the bills do not go out for a month.
They really play ""Hide the Ball,"" to get anything working.  They are all geared for Sales and pushing you to buy more. Attitude is curt, ""play dumb,"" (and most do not understand problems-they ask really obvious questions that any idiot would have tried) and they do not care.  Takes days or weeks to get a simple question answered.  They will email irrelevant answers as though you had not discussed things several times previously. They don't even read or answer the full email, obviously.  It is token. You have to be yourown tech person.

Takes 10X as much time as it should because of inherent problems and waiting on support.  Sage should be out of business. Used TS over 20 years, but Sage is a VERY BAD company. Plus, they are set up for eastern time. As soon as I get time, I will get another program.  Any recommendations w cloud/web based would be appreciated."
"Outlook with Business Contact Manager is a misnomer. BCM is in reality a bolt-on application that works alongside Outlook with a similar file structure. This would be a fine arrangement except that Outlook and BCM do not integrate together. For example, contacts with the same name in both Outlook and BCM are different contacts and do not share information nor do they synchronize in any way. I use a hosted Outlook Exchange service that keeps my desk and mobile email and contacts synchronized. When I moved a contact from Outlook to BCM I lost visibility of that contact through Exchange and the contact became visible only through my desktop. This is an unacceptable backward step. I just wasted the hundred bucks I spent on the Outlook with BCM application. As best I can tell, the best contact manager/CRM systems are now the web 2.0/hosted applications such as Salesforce, Zoho, Sugar, etc. I suggest using one of them. Good luck."
"We have had this software since my son was 18 months and now he is three. At first I would go through it with him and he enjoyed the beautiful garden and the Pooh characters. There are also alot of place where you can just click and make things happen - like a skunk stealing rabbit's flowers, a squirrel playing drums on the roof etc. Now he can do most of the games himself with a little help. You start out in the garden and can go from there either North, East or West - in each place you have a choice of going to someone's house - Tigger's, Rabbit's, Pooh's etc. and in each is a different math related game. Most of the games are very good - our favorites are Piglet's house in which you decorate two trays of cupcakes and then add how many total you have and Tigger's house where you drop different items into his machine (in the order on the blueprint) and then a contraption pops out at the end. When you finish 5 rounds of a game you get a prize for your garden like tomatoes to plant or a windmill, waterfall etc. in the end the garden gets quite elaborate. This software is well worth the money."
"Coherence desktop sort of works with Retina display.  However, there are many Windows applications where their user interface (UI) (especially simple text buttons) gets incredibly squished together or clipped.  It must have to do with how the software is written.  Things like CADs and drawing programs will have their own UI that the Retina conversion makes menus unusable.

It would be nice if Macs could be used professionally outside of desktop publishing or DJing, but that is more Apple's problem of marketing only to the idiot consumer that likes shiny.  Retina screens in particular are an example of this, though I would expect Parallels to test the product themselves on common professional software.  If Coherence fully worked on the Autodesk or Dassault product lines it would be a good price.

Coherence in a Linux VM is crappier and less developed/supported.  There are no options for it nor any great detail on what desktop features break it.  And when it 'works', fonts are usually aliased badly as well as much of the UI.

Parallels also has an option to make the windows UI look Mac.  Don't do it, it doesn't change window management placement.  It just makes the frame 'look' similar to a default Mac theme.  It also isn't Coherence compatible so the window frame and icons shrink back to super high res.  It appears to be some freeware they downloaded and tossed on to the menu options long ago and don't maintain.

Parallels does an OK job sharing your user folder and online shares (SkyDrive and Dropbox anyway) between the host and virtual machines.  Other than the file sharing and Coherence, Parallels offers nothing over free software like VirtualBox.  Don't expect any updates as any improvements will be in the next version and upgrades are about the same cost as buying new.  So the price is kind of high and on top of that they like to pop up ads on your desktop.  THEY POP UP ADS ON YOUR DESKTOP!?!?!? I believe I would recommend instead another system such as VirtualBox or VMware (if you must buy one)."
"I have been a bookkeeper for over 30 years and have worked with numerous different accounting software.  QuickBooks, by far, is the easiest and most intuitive product I've ever used.  I currently use QB Pro 2016 and love it!  From the reporting to the ease of payroll and quarterly reporting to being able to pick the color of my background screen.  If the product stayed just what it is today, I would be happy to stick with it for as long as I own my own business and do accounting for my job."
"This software is very good. I installed it on my daughters Windows 7 laptop and it runs perfectly.  I actually purchased the software over a year ago using Amazon download.  My daughter loves it.  She is homeschooled.  The software is very exciting, has lots of games, and is very interactive.  It covers a lot of subjects ranging from multiplication/division, addition/subtraction, all the way to grammar and reading exercises.  It teaches spanish, has chess game, and Mavis Beacon typing game in it.  Elementary Advantage is for grade levels K-5.

Did I mention that it also teaches phonics.  The software is so good, I spend a lot of time with my daughter just listening to it teach. The software starts from low level difficulty and gradually raises the difficulty level over time without the child really noticing it.

I honestly feel that the software is better than most public school classrooms because my daughter spends hours on it and she starts telling me word for word what she's learned about grammar as well as the other topics the software teaches.

The software allows for more than one child to use it through the use of profiles.  Its provides very low level simplistic grading system using different color stars. Bronze, Silver, Gold.

There is a downside to the this software and that is if you need to use it to keep records of progress and curriculum for states that require it, this program does not do a good job of that.  The reports it produces are more for the child themselves and not for adults.

Overall I rate it a 4.  I would have given it a 5 if it had better progress reporting system and performance tracking built in.

I highly recommend it. Your child will love it and their grades will improve.  You will see them learn so much on their own without a teacher or parent looking over their shoulders.  That's when the real learning starts when the child learns for the enjoyment of learning instead of it being a chore.

I do not know if this program will run on Windows 8 although I will be testing it in the near future.  I plan to purchase a Windows 8 tablet pc so she can use this program along with other educational websites/software when we are out traveling or sight seeing."
I did not like this security program I was always wasting time doing scans etc.  I like a system that works behind the scene.
"Just wanted to alert others to the horrible experience I've had that is still ongoing as of today. I purchased Enhanced Payroll about 2 months ago.

As others have mentioned, I had to call to activate and give them a credit card number. I only have 1 employee and I made it clear I did not want to auto renew. I ended up having to give my credit card number anyway as that was the only way they would activate my license.

Several days ago, a charge on my card from Intuit for $436.43 appeared. No warning. No invoice. No receipt from Intuit showing the charge.

I called support right away. First they tried telling me that there was a per paycheck fee. I had to explain that since I only have 1 employee, I'm not subject to any fee. Even if I were $436.43 is obviously incorrect as I've only run payroll twice a month for 2 months.

I gave the support rep the license number I purchased 2 months ago. She said she would investigate and call me back on my mobile within an hour. I waited 3 hours. I did not get a call back so I called again.

Again, I had to sit on hold then explain my situation from the top to a different rep. I was asked to email a screenshot of my bank statement showing the charge.

I sent the bank screenshot, my case number, and screenshots from my Intuit account showing that my original license didn't expire until June 2015. 48 hours went by with no response. I sent a follow up email. Still waiting...

So as it stands now, my 2 month old license is deactivated and the erroneous unauthorized charge has not been refunded. If you're thinking of buying this, good luck. I will never buy an Intuit product again."

"I first purchased the McAfee Profesional software.  After reading the reviews for the McAfee Antivirus, I returned it and exchanged for the Norton 2002.  Then I read the reviews herein for Norton, and found the same types of complaints.  After discussing with my tech support analyst at work, he assured me that the Norton (and McAfee)should install an run as advertised.  It did, installed, downloaded updates and scans without any problems - in W98 OS.  I'm wondering if the anti Norton and McAfee reviews are written by stockholders of the other company?"

"In my previous review of Windows 8, I excoriated the product for how the ""Windows Update"" process interrupts regular usage of the product.  That was two years ago.  I have some new remarks to add:

I recently purchased a new PC.  The performance of Windows 8 on this new PC is really awesome.  Running on an SSD, I can hardly believe how fast it boots.  As creepy as some people find Microsoft's usage of the cloud to log you in to your personal computer, I appreciated that for once, I set up a new computer without having to dig thru the configuration to tell Windows that I want to see file extensions and drive letters.

Alas, I still think that Windows 8 is an even worse product than when I previously reviewed it.  I recently traveled with my computer.  I thought that I might have some free time on my hands during the trip, so I installed a video game from Steam.  I didn't know what internet access I might have on my trip, so I made sure that everything worked well before leaving home.  This was a good decision in retrospect, because my internet access was limited to unreliable ""aircards"".

Almost immediately, I started having problems where various parts of Windows 8 didn't work, including the ""Start Menu"".  I did a Google search and came to the conclusion that I needed to do a ""System Restore"".  System Restore fixed my Start Menu, but removed my Steam game that I had recently installed, so I wasn't able to enjoy it during my trip.

Three weeks later, I started having another strange problem.  I started seeing the error message that I couldn't log in with my profile, and was being logged in with a ""temporary profile"" where I couldn't use my files.  I checked the ""Event Viewer"" and saw a registry error message.  I did a Google search and once again, the solution was to use ""System Restore"".

Having lost stuff on my machine last time I did System Restore, I made a backup of my ""Documents"" folder.  When you run ""System Restore"", it clearly tells you: ""System Restore does not affect any of your documents, pictures, or other personal data"".  I'm glad I made a backup of my ""Documents"" folder because System Restore trashed everything I did in ""Documents"" since the restore point, in spite of the message to the contrary.  I could have lost hours of hard work!

Microsoft, your product is unreliable in it's purpose and it's design is a menace to the data that we entrust to it.  I want Microsoft to know that I've been a professional software developer using Visual Studio (which is an awesome product), but if I can't trust my operating system to do safeguard my work; if I can't trust my computer not to delete my work in the course of its regular operation, I'm going to have to move to a different platform for my professional work, despite the investment of time and energy that I've put into becoming a .net developer.

***

Following is my original review:

I am an IT professional.  I will be turning 30 this year, and my family had our first computer when I was 10.  I've seen 20 years worth of different versions of Windows, and this one is just awful.

Most complaints I hear about Windows 8 center around the ""Metro"" UI.  I personally don't like the ""Metro"" UI, but don't consider it a reason to avoid the product.  After all, people will legitimately disagree about how a computer interface should be designed.  My overall take on ""Metro"" is that it is a one-size-fits all solution for phones, tablets, and PCs where one size doesn't fit all!

I must add that one positive thing about Windows 8 is that it is a little bit easier to set up in a dual-boot configuration with Ubuntu Linux.

My big issue with Windows 8 has to do with Windows Updates.  Since Windows 7, I have had mixed feelings about Windows Updates.  I understand that security patches must be periodically installed to protect the Internet at large from wide-scale virus infections, malware, etc.  I find it annoying that Microsoft programmed Windows 7 to automatically install updates when rebooting and even to display instructions: ""Do not turn off your computer.""  Personally, I consider the idea of a computer giving orders to a person absurd.

Here's the experience with Windows 8 that has convinced me to recommend avoiding Windows 8 to everyone I know.  Today, I had to boot Windows because I had a task to do with some hardware that doesn't work with Ubuntu.  At the end, I had some information to key in to a web form.  While filling out the web form, Windows 8 presented to me a warning that the computer was about to restart in 15 minutes to install Windows Updates.  Ten minutes later, it showed me a warning that the computer would restart in five minutes.  Fortunately, I was able to finish filling and submitting the web form before time elapsed.  However, just to see what would happen, I waited five more minutes.

What happened next nearly made my blood boil.  Normally, I try not to allow a computer (a tool) to make me mad, but I must make an exception here.  The thing that happened was the computer automatically restarted without warning and began to install Windows Updates.  As I said, I was able to finish my task before the time expired, but suppose I hadn't.  This web form didn't allow me to save my work.  I would have lost what I was working on!  It's one thing that the computer would give me orders: ""Do not turn off your computer.""  It's another thing entirely for the designers of software that I paid money for the privilege of using to design the system to usurp my control of my computer and make it do what they think it should do instead.

I'm reminded of the old joke about the Explorer shell in Windows 95: ""It says 'My Computer' because Bill Gates thinks that putting Windows on it makes it his!""

My recommendation is: Avoid this product.  Stick with Windows 7 or try Ubuntu instead.

I wrote a bit more about this issue on my web site: [...]"

"Don't listen to the supposed ""Most helpful review""ONE star. I am an avid computer user, I have a lot of experience in many different softwares, and I have built my own computer multiple times. I have used a lot of different kinds of anti virus programs but none of them match the security of this program right here. Having been a user of Bit Defender for more than 6 years myself, I have never once (even in this newest installation) seen a popup or ad or what have you. THOSE people that have those issues must have a virus or something they allowed to get through.

I had a nasty Trojan when I tried to download, and was unable to complete the download.
You did give me a link to someone who would help me remotely.
Unfortunately by this time, my network connection was irretrievable, so I couldn't use this link.
Eventually I backed my system to an earlier date, and this seemed to clear the problem, and I was able to complete the download.
So, thank you for the offer of help.  My purchases thru Amazon have always been without problem, and I will continue to use it."
"I've tried this program on 5 different Windows XP computers, and it only runs on one of them.  And, yes I have done all the compatibility adjustments.

Received it immediately. Did not load at first but gave me instructions on how to update my PC. Works great now.
I have been using Quickbooks in my company for many years now. This latest version reflects the continuing quality and improvements that previous versions of Quickbooks have shown. We are and have been very pleased with this software. We have been using Quickbooks since 1996.

"I've had WEBROOT since 2009 and I have not had one single problem...literally. What I love most about WEBROOT is that it will block you from continuing into a web site due to viruses.

Thank goodness for thank because I honestly cannot remember all of my passwords. There's a lot more WEBROOT does for you but I would be here all day telling you. You just have to see for yourself.

"Pros: code editor is improved, good idea with the FTP background capabilities, love the new zoom feature

Cons: Macromedia put this out hastily, bugs in the FTP, the file times aren't correct, can't use it in a professional enviornment, no word of when updater will be available

I think Macromedia raced to get this one to market. I've been using Dreamweaver since version 2. It's a powerful tool that has evolved into something close to remarkable concerning development of professional web sites/applications. But...

If you have Dreamweaver MX 2004, you have a better version of Dreamweaver than version 8. I can't use 8 in a professional environment due to the way that it stamps file times incorrectly. Collegues are left wondering what the real time was that a page was last worked on. Sometimes the FTP doesn't upload the files that are selected. In a professional environment, this is a major quirk - imagine trying to move 100 files and 10 of them don't make it. You've got to go through all of them to figure out which ones didn't. I've never seen this from another version of Dreamweaver. .

I was hooked by the marketing presentations from Macromedia. I'm glad that Adobe bought them out because the way that the company looked in the end wasn't the same as the first few years I was using their products. But I am afraid of what Adobe will do to the Macromedia suite. KEEP YOUR MX2004 STUDIO. It may contain the last stable version of Dreamweaver. I can imagine working on web sites for the next 5 years with MX2004. If DW8 gets a good update, then I would recommend getting it at that point because the new features are really cool and worth the upgrade if you are in a professional environment. If not, then you may not even notice them."
"These days, if anyone owns a computer, they have to purchase protection software for spyware, firewalls and anti-virus. Although there are many different kinds of popular brands like Norton, and McAffe that have n't done very well at protecting against these certain brands. For EZ Armor and CA's Etrust, they do a mostly good job at making the grade at computer protection. Their Internet Security Suite delivers good quality service on some programs on protection, like Anti-Virus and firewall. Unfortunately, the anti-spam and spyware prtection doesn't actually deliver well, and if you have other internet protection software for spyware, it could definitely interfere either way. I suggest for those who just need an anti-virus software to get this. Otherwise, get something that might be better for your computer.

"Looks Great when Created, but Very Poor Resolution When Printed!

I was excited to get this software and it installed fine and I had fun selecting cards and customizing them.  Easy and fun to use!!!  However, two problems:

(1) The software led me to believe that online cards were included.  To send online greetings, you need to pay extra at the Hallmark site (annual fee).  The software ONLY includes a link.

(2) Cards look terrific on the PC as edited and saved...  I sent to my local printer (UPS store) for quality color printing on card stock and the result came back with very poor resolution graphis.  Very grainy pictures and the words were almost blurry on the card.  I am very disappointed in the resolution of the finished product."

"Why do I need to continue updating a program that worked fine enough?  I use Quicken for clients and if they upgrade or switch, I am required to upgrade.  The product works fine but I'd like it to respond faster and provide more reports."
"I got this because I use PayPal and Quicken doesn't support importing QIF files, and I thought it would be useful to get on Quickbooks anyway.  PayPal does support the exporting of Quickbooks format (iif I think) - so I figure this would be perfect.

However, Overly Simple Start doesn't support this basic, simple task of importing data from anywhere, in any format.  You are stuck typing in every transaction... And if you are getting a lot of payments on PayPal, this will cost you TONS and TONS of time.

I don't think that this goes for other versions of Quickbooks, and it did look like I might be able to ""use"" the software - if I didn't mind spending hours entering data.. And I don't know if I can later export that to the real version of Quickbooks when I need to...

I paid $99 for this, and the only good thing I can say about the purcahse is that it can be written off as a business expense... :-("
"I've used TurboTax every year since the mid-90's but I'm dropping it now.  The basic features of handling the sale of a mutual fund and being able to actually e-file it, or likewise a lowly Schedule C, have simply stripped out or the Deluxe version, because, heck, no one does that, right?  But, I'm told I can buy the unenhanced, gold-plated Premiere version for 40% more than last years download to get exactly the same functionality.

This is the second Netflix type blunder Intuit has made.  Several years ago they dropped Quicken for the Mac because, as everyone knows, no one uses a Mac and Apple is about to go bankrupt.  That worked out well.  I used it since the early 90's but one day, they said it's not gong to be compatible with this new fangled Intel based Mac thing.  No market there, have a good life (here's Mint).  I switched to MoneyDance and could not be happier.  When Intuit finally came out with a Mac version a couple years later I have not switched back and won't.

So now, thank you Intuit, for helping me switch away from you as my tax software to a different vendor this year, probably TaxAct or H & R Block.

One star because there is no half star."
"Intuit's new bundling arrangement is awful and expensive.  I have used their programs for taxes, personal financial recording and another of their programs for my business for years but now they are trying to act like ACT! did after Sage took over there.  (I no longer use their CRM programs at all).  Turbo Tax did a good job once I decided which version I needed to use.  The process of determining that almost took me as long as the return itself.  Intuit needs to rebundle things back like before and adjust the prices for their software or they will be losing customers, including me!"
"I've used Norton Antivirus for years. I tried Macafee once in college, and although it found all the viruses on my system, it was unable to clean any of them. Norton saved me.

In fact, it's working better for me than last year's version.

"Coming from the era of flipping albums every 20 or so minutes, being able to access a fairly large ""record"" collection so easily and from such a variety of sources is, frankly, amazing. Creating an account was easy and reasonably quick, and the 250,00 song ""limit"" is pretty substantial, in my opinion.  My only complaint has been the service's inability to download a portion of my collection. The service begins the process of downloading that particular bunch of songs, but ultimately it fails and I'm given a message that the download has stopped. I've tried several times with the same result. To be fair, I've not sought any tech assistance, so the problem may be easily solved or the explanation absolutely reasonable. Other than that the service has worked as advertised and seems well priced. I would and already have recommended this service to others."

For those of you who have never tried this product and also for those of you who have spent hundreds of dollars on anti-virus software that doesn't work, I HIGHLY and STRONGLY recommend Kaspersky. I have been using this software since 2009. Since 1998 when I had my first computer, an HP Pavillion, I have had about 20 computers! Why? For the sad and simple reason that the anti-virus programs that I purchased in the past did not protect my computers from viruses. Every year for the past 4 years, I go on Amazon and purchase Kaspersky and I STILL have the same computer I bought in 2009. This is an AMAZING product. I think ALL virus protection software gives some degree of ""slowness"" to one's computer, but Kaspersky has never made me feel like my system was lagging or dragging which is a BIG + for me! I love seeing the pop ups in the bottom right hand corner when I click on a bad email or link - Kasperky catches trojans, worms, malware, etc. BEFORE it wrecks my computer. Also....try to find a better price than this! This saves us a bundle! Thanks Amazon! I again HIGHLY recommend this product to everyone from personal computers to businesses! Good luck and enjoy!"
Too hard to learn.
Works great for everything I need.
Product arrived promptly and was just what I expected. Worked well on my new computer.  What more can I say?
Received Key Card that was already used???
great
"Great addition to the Henle Latin 1 curriculum.  Refers often to grammar rules and the source text.  If using the ECCLESIASTICAL pronounciation, not Classical, this cd can be very helpful."
"Before buying, make sure this has forms you need. As a CPA, I have to prepare contracts quickly for many purposes. This CD has many though certainly not all templates I need. It has over 140 contracts and forms with updates through 2009. The 2011 version has been out for some time, and now I use the 2010 version.

What I like: You select your form and go through the interview.
What I don't like: You then save it in your ""portfolio.""  That's worse than annoying.
That's how they get you, by forcing these docs to be stored in the program's portfolio. You can modify any of these docs later to further suit your particular requirements.

While 140 contracts and forms is a lot, it does not meet all my needs. For example, a non-disclosure agreement is not included."
"I would strongly recommend Mavis Beacon for anyone desiring to learn to type. It came highly recommended by IT types, and it lived up to its reputation."
"The cd's did not work because we needed some other cd that comes before it.  I don't really know what that would be.  If I can get some help with this I would appreciate it, as I don't want to loose that much money on something not useable."
"I purchased Quicken 2015 because, according to the website, ""Quicken communicates directly with your bank."".

This is, in fact, untrue.  Hidden below, in a click-through link, it states that,
* Your login credentials are stored on Intuit-hosted servers. This makes updates faster for you.
* Your financial data is stored on Intuit-hosted servers. This provides a more complete history of your financial transactions than is typical for data stored on financial institution servers.

I want intuit to have neither.  This is never made clear and obvious during the setup.

I found this out, because their service that logs in to your bank was down, and I was unable to update.

I'm sickened by their deceptiveness.

[Update 10/11]
In addition, the app does not update account transaction information properly.  It will tell you that the update completed, and that zero transactions were downloaded... yet, when I log in to my financial institution, I see several transactions that never made it.

Deceptive and unreliable.  Exactly two things I don't want from a financial service provider."
It works like it should.
"This is an exercise in frustration for the amateur video editor.  The menus and selections are obscure, the ""knowledge base"" is unhelpful, and the contact by e-mail malfunctions even after registering the product.  The only selection for help on the phone number is for paid help.  If you want to use this product, you should plan to buy a book to go with it."
Download version is easy to install and saves finding a place to storing another DVD.  Software is very good as protecting your PC.
"This program is a complete joke. Quark has basically re-issued Quark 4 (and 5 for that matter) with almost NOTHING new worth mention.

* The very first thing you'll notice is this ridiculous validation scheme. Think you're going to buy software and install it and go to work? Wrong!! You have to be validated first which, if something goes wrong, can take DAYS!

* The multiple undo's would have been a great feature for 1998, even now not everything is undo-able.

* Quark has this wonderful new system of ""Projects"" and documents. If you ever pick-up an old document to make some changes and then re-save as a new one, the old file name remains with the file because Quark assumes you're just adding a new document to the project...A MAJOR ANNOYANCE! If you do use the project thing as intended (multiple documents and sizes wrapped up into a single file) you still have to collect each individual document seperately! HELLO?! HOW BOUT ""COLLECT ALL""??

* The ""Export to PDF"" feature so rarely works, I don't even bother with it. I still have to ""print"" to a PDF.

* The ""full resolution preview"" isn't and frequently causes crashes when trying to change the preview res on a picture.

* All the old stupid annoying things about Quark are faithfully preserved in version 6...

  * Still no ""update all"" feature in the links menu.

  * Still no way to select a graphic and tell Quark to re-link to something different.

  * Still no key commands to select tools on the tool palette.

  * Still limited to 48x48"" layouts.

  * Still no support for  OpenType. If you use OpenType fonts, expect lots of very strange letter spacings, etc.

* Lots of people still use Quark 4. If you need to save down, you must save from Q6 to Q5, then Q5 to Q4. If you're upgrading from 4 to 6, YOU'RE SCREWED! Quark 6 WILL NOT save down to Quark 4!

* Quark brags about all these new features that NOBODY will have a use for. Web pages?! PLEASE! Not even even a half-a** hack web designer would try to create a website in Quark! I tried just for the experience and believe me, it's a joke! 3 words... NO CODE VIEW!! How bout 4 more? NO MEASUREMENT IN PIXELS. These things alone makes Quark a web program not to be taken seriously.

If you're DYING to waste nearly $900, keep your antique Quark 4 or 5 and take that money to Vegas. Better yet, download a free trial of InDesign and see what a REAL page layout program should look like in the year 2004!"
"My daughter is 4, and she loves My Little Pony, this game helped her with her math skills, it asks questions about probability, which tree has more red apples, what tree has better chance of red vs. green apples falling off, etc. It is just a great game, you can unlock the different ponies and have an adventure. Our daughter beat the game and asked us to reset it for her so she could do it all again, even though it meant losing all progress."
Too expensive to add multiple states as well as e-filing multiple states.
This awful product takes over your toolbar and inserts its own search engine and homepage. I have spent hours trying to get rid of it. The instructions on AVG's website for getting rid of it don't work. I wish I had never installed AVG.
Been using quicken for 25 years now...great for home finance
"I like the interface and organizing my music. But I don't like buying the music and having it not Automatically download at the time of purchase. If I don't manually download a song immediately after purchase, it is difficult to find later to download it."
"The other guys put their program on sale everywhere this year, but I find H&R Block to be the simplest program and I just downloaded it from Amazon and started it up. My husband does some consulting and all of his expenses are covered. I am a teacher and still taking classes and it covers all that too. It does say something when the printout of the Federal form is TEN pages shorter than my state form, but that's politics, not economics."
Will not purchase Kaspersky Internet Security again. I liked it and was using it for a number of years and had just purchased and installed it on my new laptop Toshiba Satellite and on 8th May 2016 clicked onto a site on Facebook only to have my new laptop lock up from a virus/malicious attack and then had to pay $200. to get technical help from Toshiba to remove it off my laptop. With this Kaspersky Internet Security it should have never happen the technician said and she also found quite a bit of other issues that fell threw the cracks due to Kaspersky as well!
I use it daily!  It saves me a lot of internet headaches!
Best edition ever
nice
"Sorry- I messed up. This review should be for the Premier, not Deluxe edition: I have been a Quicken user since the 1990s and I have generally been pleased with the software. I use it to keep track of both my expenses and extensive investment portfolio (many individual stocks and accounts). I don't use it to actually create a budget but it certainly provides a great historical record for seeing my expense trends and investment performance over the years. I only upgrade when I need to due to their update process expiring for the edition that I have. That means I just upgraded from 2010 to 2013. I was leery given the negative reviews I saw posted here. I would have to say I have been pleasantly surprised (at least so far having only had the upgrade for a couple of days) by the lack of issues I have had. I had no problem converting my 2010 file to 2013 other than a few accounts that I had hidden that reappeared. It took me five minutes to rehide those old accounts. In terms of using the software, so far so good. In fact, I have noticed at least a couple of minor bugs the previous software had that have been ""fixed"" with this release. I do not use the mobile connectivity the new software has (nor do I plan to) so I can't comment on that. I will update this review if anything negative comes up but like I said- it's been fine so far. I personally can understand the need of Intuit to require updates every few years and I think their pricing to do it is reasonable. It is critical that the software be accurate and reliable and that is what I have always experienced with Quicken and it appears to be so with this release too (at least as of the date I upgraded)."
"Nothing works. I have downloaded it, following the directions. I have not been able to save items and then bring it up as an attachment, I can't open folders I have saved from a previous time. What is most frustrating, though, is that I now have to search around to find a phone number so I can receive assistance. That should take time I don't have. I need this now. Do not buy this."
"PC World, as it? PC Magazine? gave this their highest review in a test. I was losing faith in Panda and so switched us over to this. (Five licenses come with it.)  Works great on my machine, and requires very little attention (from me, across the continent) on my 90-yr-old mother's machine. Well done Norton!"
"I bought three disc for three different computer's and all the disc installed differently. On one XP computer it was flawless. On another XP computer it only gave me the option to install Anti-Virus. The third disc installed on Vista would not install the anti- virus or the spyware. I contacted CA over the problem and they told me to uninstall and reinstall, that didn't help. I finally gave up after 5 times trying and bought Norton Anti-Virus 2009 with Spyware and at last IM finally up and surfing the internet again. For whatever reason Vista owner's beware of the 2009 version of this product as you may encounter issues installing."
"Best price I could find anywhere this year.  Easy online purchase and fast Free Super-Saver shipment.  Arrived early.  Installed cleanly with fast update downloads.  Although, I have yet to put the software to use. I'm sure it will not be any different than the last ten years I've been saving money using this tax prep application."
Difficult to set font on Windows 10 tablet. Works well on Nook tablet
"This version of Peachtree 2012 has big problems and lots of bugs. I've spent hours just trying to install it. Peachtree offers very little support for the product. Right now their website is lit up with angry customers asking for their money back, but nobody can get through on the phone to Peachtree. Beware of this before putting your important business data into such an unreliable system."
Be prepared to have this piece of software regularly interrupt your work in order to have you verify your subscription. User help for this or any other problem is non-existent.
"This software is the easiest and fastest to learn and fastest to use.  It has features of much higher priced professional video editing packages.  The documentation is great.  User interface the BEST!  Easy to use.  Yes, you can use it without ever opening the documentation.  You can get professional results.  SmartSound music backgrounds that come with the package are also easy to use and sound GREAT.  This is the package for home users and you can not beat the price.  There are only a few bugs left in this software as it is a mature package.  You must follow the rules though and turn off everything in the background using ctl, alt, delete and removing everything except Explorer and System Tray.  Defragment your hard drive and you will  eliminate most troubles that plague others that don't do these simple things before running Studio 8. I wish it had at least one more video and audio track available.  But then no one would ever buy upgraded packages if it had everything.  Buy this one if you want an easy to use video editor for HOME use.  It is not for making commercial videos.  I'm now using Edition DV as well."
excellent
superior product...........buy buy buy
"I experienced the same problems with Winzip 17.
I received nothing that said ""activation code"" with the product.

In order to register the software, you have to first register with the serial number located inside the front cover, underneath the WinZip sheet.  It would be helpful if instructions on registering would be included.
Once you register with the serial number, WinZip displays your name and an actual activation code, and you can register using that.

The software works well... the confusion over how to get an activation code is completely ridiculous.  I had to write 3 times to WinZip before I got an explanation on how to register the software."
Good tutorials for those who want to learn Ms Office at home.
"I have to say, overall I am pleased with the product but really disappointed in the misrepresentation and customer service. I ordered this after getting QuickBooks Pro, which didn't work well for me at all. I went with Sage for the inventory management system they had. I was specifically told this one had the ability to do multiple units of measure, and even in the user manual it had directions on multiple units of measure. This is the main reason why I purchased this. The directions, however, didn't match the product. The product itself has NO MULTIPLE UNITS OF MEASURE. I was pretty upset when I discovered this as I spoke with the Sage representative prior to purchasing. I called Sage again to see why it didn't have what I needed. I was told that this version didn't have it, that the version before did. If I wanted multiple units of measure, I have to purchase Quantum (which is a few thousand dollars) and they consistently tried to upsell me. I was transferred 8 times on the phone over and over, and nothing was solved. I was told I would get a call the following Monday, and no one called me back. I never received another call. I called them a few times after and still nothing had been resolved.

I feel really disappointed with the customer service of this. I think I will use this product for a little bit, but I will probably switch to something else. I hate that I use it now, but I paid money for it and don't want that to go to waste. Overall, Sage 50 Pro is okay, but the customer service is awful. I would not recommend the company."
I have used Norton 360 for 4 years and have had no problems with the software. As advertised I am able to install it on 3 of our personal computers which is a great benefit.
"don't be stupid. H&R Block and all of the other tax preparation places like it ARE GARBAGE. their people are incompetent and 99% of them know less about taxes than I do and i'm not a tax professional or haven't taken the 8 hour course they took to become a ""Tax Professional"". buy turbotax. i have been buying some iteration of turbotax off of amazon for years now and it never fails to be easy to use and get me 2X, 3X, 4X, 5X, etc... more than i ever got back going to H&R Block and the others. Don't be intimidated. If you know how to turn on a computer and browse the internet and have extremely basic computer knowledge, and have all of the paperwork you would need for H&R Block to do your taxes for you, then BUY Turbotax and I guarantee you'll pay less, it'll be done faster, and YOU WILL GET A BETTER REFUND TOO!"
"Honestly, I have been an XP users for most of my life until I switched over to Apple. I decided to build a Windows Computer and I see so much bad reviews on 8.1. After giving it a try.. I SERIOUSLY DO NOT see what is wrong with this OS. It is great!!! I found everything that I needed to find like control panel, etc. Yes, I do miss the start button but come on, that feature will be available again in windows 10.. also there are 3rd party programs for you to enable the start menu if it bothers you so much. I guess I am one of the few who likes this OS."
Difficult to deal with and won't talk to my PC version. Makes me want to go back to pencil & ledger!
"This was a waste of money for me....(I also bought Learn to Speak Spanish Deluxe for 14.99 and really like it, it installs on your computer).....I need to speak with Spanish Speakers from Mexico so I  bought this...it's one DVD that must be in the Computer for the program to work... I get a LOT of errors and program closes.... example..when using the Count to 20 in Spanish the program counted 1 thru 4...would not say 5....then went on to count 6 thru 20... The mp3 files would not install on computer...started to install and then I got an error and had to abort...
  I think children would enjoy this program if it worked.

( FYI...it's not my computer that's the problem..... I don't have problems with other software..)

Update...I tried the program again this morning and didn't have the problems I had yesterday with the DVD and program closing on my computer...maybe when I tried to download for mp3 and got error ..abort...it somehow made errors occur with program on computer...I'm not tring that again.... I changed my rating from one star to three because I think young children would like the program and learn from it...."
"If you have used MS Streets & Trips, then you'll know your way around AutoRoute.  We are using this to plan a trip to Europe next May.  Based on my knowledge of locations in Britian, the software appears to be pretty accurate.  If you want to use this with a GPS that does not come bundled with the package, expect some frustration.  I still have not figured out how to get it to talk to my USB based Garmin unit.  I think it is possible, just do not know how."
I have not been able to use 2010 Quick Book with my bank and this was my main reason for buying Quick Book the new version. Any sugestions would help.
"My cousin's pit bull bit my RX100 and broke the LCD. Other than that, only a couple of toothmarks were on the front of the thank-heavens-it's-metal body. I sent it to Sony who told me it would cost $300 to fix and in their opinion it wasn't worth it. (There's a PhD thesis in there somewhere.)

When I found this replacement LCD I was ready to take a chance. It turned out to be a Sony OEM screen (or a really good forgery), so that was good. However, I got no installation instructions with it. I emailed the vendor and they sent me a PDF showing how to take the body apart, but not how to install the screen. After a second email they directed me to a YouTube video of someone replacing the LCD on a different model, which is of limited help.

All my life I've been the kind of person who takes things apart just to see how they work. I would advise anyone who has NOT had experience doing this that they should buy the screen and have a camera repair person put it in. It should take a pro 15-30 minutes and be well worth the money. Me? I managed to get through the process, although there were a couple of leaps of faith (push the detached back of the camera and the screen pops out). The most difficult part was attaching the floppy bit of the LCD connector to the camera; this really needs a special tool. After closing up and trying the camera the first time it didn't work - bad connection. So I took it apart again and pushed harder, hoping I wouldn't bend anything so much that it broke. It worked.

So, if your camera takes pictures but the LCD is broken, this replacement will work and save a $500 camera from the dustbin. Just be aware of installation issues."
We love cutey pie Freddi. We played Humongous Games back in the late 90's. That child is now 20 yrs old but his 2 brothers are 6 & 2 1/2 & I know they'll love these games too if they can sit still long enough to play them. Freddi is the bomb diggity in our family.
"Essentials 2 for Adobe Photoshop Elements is a great supplement to an already fine program for photo enthusiasts who still own Apple's Power PC (Motorola) computers, although it also lists Intel processors as being served. The 4 additions offered really help fine tune an image for presentation purposes. Essentials 3 however is for Intel based only computers, but Essentials 2 is still a welcome supplement that makes a difference."
"Took about an hour on the phone with Intuit to activate ""enhanced"" payroll.  They required a cc number so they could turn on Auto-Renewal for the payroll service; $417 for next year!  Absolutely ridiculous when the new version of QB with enhanced payroll is only $289

EDIT:
1 hour after activating enhanced payroll I got an email from Intuit saying they just processed a payment for $184 for basic payroll via auto-renewal.  another 30 minutes on the phone with them to clear that up.  there is NO GOOD reason for them to require (and store) a cc number.  make sure you disable all auto-pay features with them.  they charge twice as much to renew the software compared to buying the new version from Amazon.

i guess i have a year to find new accounting software..."
"This is one of the biggest scams that I have ever run across.  I've used Adobe products for at least 20 years, but now I'm looking for alternatives to their products.  I'm loyal to a brand that works well for me but there is a breaking point, and Adobe has reached it."
"This past year I switched from PC to Mac.  The digital drawing / paint program I'd been using was PC only.  This meant I had to go on a  search for a replacement.  I tested freebies, cheapies, watched videos, read reviews, etc etc.  Still I was pretty set in my ways so nothing was quite right.  Initially I wasn't sure this was right, still, by the end of a demo period of the full version, I'd fallen in love and was able to recommend it to my mom as it's available on both PC and Mac.

There are plenty of brushes (this was biggest concern in switching as my former program had more brushes than anyone could ever use), every feature in it is simple enough for even a beginner to understand, recent service pack upgrades include a Copic marker set complete with a Copic marker color scheme.

It works exactly the same with the cheap tablet I have as with the Wacom in the house.

You'll get probably just about everything you'd expect from a product bold enough to imply it could be replacing your sketchbook in it's name..."
tks for everything. I love my product.  I feel much saer that my computer is being protected the it is.. Todav887
"My opinion about McAfee's new Internet Security Suite Version 7.0 has changed little from my last years review of their Internet Security Suite Version 6.0, although I gave the newer version 2 stars instead of 1 star from last year.

Installed the software on my desktop as per the instructions and there still is an issue with the Privacy Service Component of the software. Contacted McAfee thru their web page support service. (You have to chat with them as before because it is the only free customer service offered, and telephone service is fee based.)

After installing all four components (Virus Scan, Spamkiller, Privacy Service & Firewall) I could not establish an internet connection. I discovered on my own thru trial and error and installing and re-installing each component one by one, that the Privacy Service Component was to blame. After going thru a lengthy procedure from McAfee.com to remove the Privacy Service Component (it's not as simple as Control Panel/Add or Remove Programs) and re-configuring my internet connection setting, and re-installing Privacy Service, I finally was able to establish the internet connection. Total time spent reading, researching, installing, re-installing, customer service, chatting, etc.... was approximately four hours. A little less time than last year but due to a different problem.

Some of the problems you will discover is that this software does not like Windows Service Pack 2 or any other additional security software to be installed on your computer. In fact, all other security software (including McAfee own last year's version of the product) must be un-installed before proceeding to install the new year's version. But, not a word of this is mentioned in the installation/Users Manual.

It seems the issue with Windows Firewall being turned on when installing has been resolved.

I did finally manage to get this software to function properly, but only after countless hours with customer support and trial & error of my own. And one good thing that resulted was I was already prepared for these issues when I installed this software on my laptop. This installation went flawlessly.

Last year I said I was switching to Norton's version of Internet Security Suite. I should have listened to my own suggestion."
"I brought this game for my then 5 y/o son a couple of years ago.  He had a blast with this game.  My older boy-then 9 also played it. It is alot of fun for I'd say 4 to 6/7 year olds.  Graphic are simple and cartoonish, but that is so appropriate for this age group. Simple to load and navigate.  The fun begins immediately."
Have always loved WP for my needs.  Find it much less complicated than Word or Open Office (free though it be).  Finally updated my 2000  version!  Happy me.
"All worked well, installed it and it came right up"
"I can't believe World of Goo is so cheap! It's the best game I've played all year and has always put a smile on my face while playing. Incredible art direction, stellar music and intuitive controls makes this a game I can't recommend highly enough. It's a breath of fresh air in a sea of violent and darkly themed games (not that there's anything wrong with those) that I'm sure will be enjoyed by gamers of any age. I picked this up as a downloadable WiiWare title on our Wii and it controls great with the remote, but I'm sure it works just as well with a mouse and keyboard. As the end of 2008 rolls in, World of Goo is picking up awards left and right, which is amazing for a game created by 2 guys in a coffee shop. Also, the lack of DRM makes installing this game on multiple machines in your house hassle-free, and I think these devs should be supported for that decision."
"One of the most important things a virus protection program has to do is update. There is a major flaw in this program that prevents it from updating. Tech support does not know what to do about the problem and cannot help. On the tech support forums most people say that the only option is downgrading to BD 2008.

Bottom line: If you want to spend a lot of time and effort trying to update your machine every week get bitdefender. If you want to save your sanity get something else."
Do not buy this product hard to use even for an EE.
Used these for supplement for tutoring my 11 year old nephew. he is moving right along in advanced studies
"This was a great product, but it is now on it's way out.  There is no technical support from  carryatune.com.  I had it installed on my laptop, but when I upgraded to Windows 7 and tried to reinstall it, the software was not recognized.  So, I tried to reinstall it on my desktop with Windows XP.  When I tried to open the program, I got an error stating that it could not run a second instance - apparently because it still thinks it's installed on my laptop.  I tried calling the company listed on the back of the software and a recorded message indicates that there is no longer support for this product.  This program allowed you to purchase songs online, now all of those songs I purchased are also unavailable."
Great product!

"I upgrade every few new releases.  This is THE BEST print software available, (and I have received or purchased many other brands).  I use  print software ALOT and NOTHING compares to Printmaster.  Don't be scared off by all the negative talkers.  It's obvious they don't have enough computer skills to utilize the software properly.  It does take some time to know all the in's and out's of the product and to learn to use it to your needs and lifestyle.  But once you've become comfortable with the operation of it, Printmaster can honestly assist you with everyday life.  Ie:  homework, invites, presentations, any personal needs.  Don't let the less than savy scare you off, the product has a tutorial."
"I am an American...of Asian and Caucasion descent.  I grew up speaking both Japanese and English fluently.  Since both languages came naturally for me, I always ASSUMED that other languages would also come easily for me and that by the time I was 'an adult' that I'd be one of those ""intelligent, wordly people"" who would have the ability to blend in various countries and speak 5 languages.

Then reality hit when I was in school and took a Japanese language class for an 'easy grade'.  I was shocked at how HARD it was to learn proper  sentence structure, conjugated words, variations of words, not to mention the different 'ways' and 'classes' of speaking from slang to appropriate to professional language then I graduated high school and took a professional translation course and found out that it even harder than I had ever imagined.  It dawned on me that it would be MUCH harder to learn other languages that I didn't even speak a single word of besides the mainstream words such as ""Ciao and Bravo!"".

Fast forward a few years and put the daily responsibilities of working, paying bills, then starting a family, raising your children, keeping a household, etc, etc...I'm creeping up on middle age and still only speak 2 languages...so much of my dreams of becoming a wordly citizen fluent in 5 languages, right?

Well, enter The RosettaStone, my renewed HOPE!!! I have attempted to learn Italian and Spanish from TV, books and tapes from other programs and have never been able to concentrate ENOUGH to absorb the teachings long enough to walk away and retain the words to use it in 'real life'.  The Rosetta Stone is structured so that it teaches you to make real use of it, it's structured so that you don't simply go through the motions of their program but you ACTUALLY REALLY, TRULY learn to SPEAK it!!!

This works SO well that I told my husband although it's not something to get through in a few days or even a few weeks, I feel confident enough that by the time I'm finished with this and he goes through it, we'll be able to take one of our dream vacations and go to Italy and actually be abel to get around and speak the language!!

I would HIGHLY recommend this program to anyone who simply wants to learn new languages for fun OR for business!!!

After I complete this Italian Rosetta program, I plan to move onto their Spanish, French and possibly Mandarin versions!!  So my travels will have to hold off until our children are a bit older but at least NOW I WILL be have the ability to speak their native languages to communicate, find out what I'm eating, learn more details about their cultures and customs and simply thoroughly ENJOY visiting and learning about other countries first hand instead of thumbing through a translation book and travelling with a tour guide being guided through like a herd of cows. I want to ABSORB the cultures and the only way to do that is to get to know the people...to get to know the people, you need to speak their language sooo....

Thank you, ROSETTA STONE!!!!"

"I used to work solely in Front Page but a friend, in the advertising industry, kept nagging me about I really needed to learn Dreamweaver.  So I've been taking a community college course in it this term.  My assignment, due in a few days, is a 5 page website and I must say that I've done an excellent job building it in Dreamweaver. I don't use templates.  I build from the white screen. I haven't begun to explore the depths of what Dreamweaver can do but already I can feel its power.  Everything you need, and I do mean everything, covers the screen real estate while you work.  If you need to get a better look at what you are building, you can easily collapse those other features so you can swell your web screen and html screen space.  Perhaps my favorite feature is the html code itself being viewable the whole time I'm building and that I can go from my web building screen to my html screen just by moving my cursor.  Dreamweaver also does not stick things I don't want into my html code which Front Page did.  (However, to be fair, when I began using Front Page, I couldn't do anything with html code anyway so that was hardly a problem)!  I also love that Dreamweaver prompts me, when I'm in the html view, about what I might want to add at that point.  Could I have used this product this effectively if it were my very first time working with building a web?  I doubt it.  There are people in my class, though, who do have entry level ability and they've decided to learn Dreamweaver as their first and only web builder.  In the long run, they probably will save themselves a lot of money and aggravation by doing so.  I would call myself an intermediate level user so I cannot evaluate this program for advanced users or programmers.  As an artist who uses Photoshop, Dreamweaver integrates beautifully with Photoshop.  The two programs work very well together and I need that as I use far more images than text in my websites.  For a user like myself, Dreamweaver is fabulous.  For a beginner, it is going to be a challenge but doable with the right learning aids such as a community college class."
"I enjoy TurboCAD very much, it has turned out to be very handy. It was definitely more than I expected"
"Been using turbotax for over a decade with good results. I like the way it saves info from previous year and auto-fills the forms saving time. Also downloads tax info from some investment brokers via internet. If you exit the program and continue later, you have to start from the beginning of a topic rather than remembering where you left off, this slows things down. Can't vouch for accuracy as I've never checked results elsewhere. If you are doing a simple return (not itemizing) you could get by with one of the free programs now available on-line, but if you wait to buy until close to April 15 the price drops to around $40 federal + state."
"Because I have used Quicken for almost 20 years, I sleep well at night knowing that my personal finances are in very good order.  I use it for all bank accounts, loans, and investments.  For years it has saved me money, allowed me to grow my wealth, and given me peace of mind.  I highly recommend it to anyone."
"There are other options, some a little cheaper, but none with the integration option like Quickbooks.  It makes the process of payroll, and accounting easy enough to confidently handle in-house.

We are a digital marketing agency, but Quickbooks allows us handle our accounting too.

Bought it for my Mom so she wouldn't have to type so much.  Works like a champ!
I've been using Kaspersky Internet security for a couple of years now. Still very happy with this protection and I haven't found a better price than on Amazon.
Good product
great price
"Excellent product,price"
This product has worked very well for years now.  I highly recommend it.
"I came to the Amazon site to buy my Deluxe TurboTax, having heard that Intuit/Turbo Tax had decided that their attempts to gouge customers was backfiring, and thus decided to replace the forms that TurboTax Deluxe had always included. However, after reading comments about the H&R Block Tax software I decided to not buy TurboTax Deluxe but by the H&R product instead from Amazon.  I download the software, installed it from Amazon without issue.  I imported my 2013 TurboTax Deluxe tax file without issue, just as I had done with TurboTax.  So far the H&R product looks and behaves just like TurboTax Deluxe.  So I think I have been paying too much to do my taxes over the years and will now ditch TurboTax Deluxe in favor of H&R Block.  Next, I am going to find a replacement product for Quicken/Intuit, which forces you to buy a new version by cutting off access to data downloads every 3 or so years.  Now I am a happy H&R Block customer and am saving money!"
Got a lot of the cyber sludge off my PC when other such tools didn't.
I was led to believe that Turbo Tax would get me a larger refund. Product did not deliver. Just kidding!  Turbo Tax has been around for hundreds of years and works great!
Very good Screen Capture and Video Capture Software.  Easy to use and good quality images.
Works great. Easy to use. Makes getting digital music from Amazon a breeze.
"I bought it because it is supposedly compatible with projects previously created in Print Shop 23 for PC.  Not really--it reads one side of a greeting card, not both sides.  But it seems to do other things that I couldn't do on PS 23."
"It did not download properly, and the instructions were definitely not clear.  I will not ever attempt to download this online again."
"There is something you need to understand about this excellent product:  It is a trimmed down compile of the Sony Vegas PRO product (which sells for much, MUCH more).

It has most of the features of the professional tool turned on, and it priced very affordably.  However, because the interface is designed for professional video editors an editing novice may find the UI little overwhelming at first.  It is completely worth the effort of learning.  The power to create polished video (and sometime save bad video that is a key shot) is a real head rush once you get there.

This version of the product includes a normal DVD with demos of how to operate the software.  If you are new to Sony Vegas, please take the time to watch them and follow along on your PC. You will find more tutorials at the Sony Vegas web site for more advanced techniques.

This is not a simple `drop in a few clips and burn a DVD/BluRay' tool.  It allows you immense control over your video and audio.

In all honestly, you can produce professional level video with the Sony Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 11 Production Suite.  It is only when you are working with high-end HD cameras that you must spend the extra for  Sony Vega PRO.

Here is a cool thing about learning the less expensive version of Sony Vegas: Everything you learn works exactly the same way in the PRO version should you ever `step up' to that level (and you get unlimited audio and video tracks with PRO, too).

I have used many video editors for PCs.  The Sony Vegas family of products has been the most reliable and powerful that I have ever used.  Its entry level price for the Sony Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 11 Production Suite makes it a steal.  I still have not needed to move up to the PRO version, the tools included in this package are just that good."
"Windows version much better and more user friendly with more robust correction interface
Crashes often on my imac (late 2013)"
"This is great also. Although, there is really no tech support for it. Make sure you get the most recent version when making your online purchase. The basic database part of the program is really neat, concise and does the job as described. We are still going strong with this program after several years of use. This is not top of the line, but a decent middle of the road or starter alternative for the price. If you configure it correctly, you can send e-mails, search the prospects website and more. Although, it will not integrate all functions like other more costly programs, but in a pinch and as less expensive alternate and/or a back up, it is more than capable."
"It's a good program and you can make DVDs with simple menu or no menu / autoplay feature.
I'd give it a 4 Stars or more but the documentation is confusing and the ""how-to's"" are lacking.
You have to really just play with it and apply logic if you're familiar with the ""explorer interface"".
I think the interface is lousy.... they should have a simplier template pull-down without all the hoo-hah
about flow-chart design.  That just sucks.  Overall a good value and useful product but could stand a better interface, template design loads and better manual."
"What can I say, TurboTax is my go to tax program and it works well with my quicken. Does the job well..."
Free trial doesn't work at all. Don't waste your time.
"Like others here, totally frustrated that it changed so much from prior years and costs more for less- AND to add insult to injury because of the fraud flags re state tax filing and TurboTax issues, I am still waiting on my state refund. I won't be back."
"I recently upgraded to Parallels 11.  I can't get El Capitan Beta to install.  I phone support.  After a 5 minute wait I get someone who has trouble with English, can't answer my question, says he has to consult with someone else, and places me on hold.  After a couple of minutes they hang up.

This is roughly ""parallel"" to my last support experience about a year ago."
"All good all around. The product works fine and I am fully satisfied. The fact that Amazon.com was in the middle of the transaction gave me no pause at any time, thank you Amazon.com. It was brand new in the box with all instructions. There was a savings to me of about $100.00.

L.J. DeGeppo"
"So far, so good."
This product does not work with windows 10 It shut down my computer and I had to remove it to get my computer up and running again. They say no refunds but I am hoping to get my money back.
Don't see much new this year.
"My 5 year old daughter loves it, though it took her a while the first time she played it through because she doesn't seem to want to explore the map completely to find a white rock, or whatever item the witch wants her to fetch. She has played it through about 10 times, so in that sense it is a rocking success."
Works fine
V good for kids.  Easy to use.
Very easy to use.  Only wish there was a way to get the state tax e-files cheaper
"Its me again The Hebrew Hammer... once more reviewing ADOBE products.  I urge anyone attempting to purchase DIGITAL MEMBERSHIPS of ADOBE any ADOBE software. While their apps used to be top of the line, with their new business model ADOBE so much praises they have committed an atrocious act by leaving decades long customers like myself out in the cold. There are many equal if not superior software alternatives to ADOBE. ADOBE had us used to believing they were the best, and I see many having the inner issue that they do not want to leave ADOBE, becoming slaves to their DIGITIAL SUBSCRIPTION. This new CLOUD thing, is nothing more than an attempt to make more money from its customers Adobe believing that since their products are superior we wouldn't complain and be forced at gun point to buy into their new scheme. It will be pricey to subscribe to a rental of applications that you FIRST do not and will not own. SECOND, while the price might seem good at first it will chew into your profits monthly at $9.99. Many businesses do not have in their budget to be paying into a subscription like if it was a darn UTILITY BILL. Many business have the initial large amount of point of sale purchase license price of $699/$899 and get to keep their physical product which they own. But to force businesses large or small and make us believe we do not have a choice is wrong. THIRD, remember by a wise consumer ponder on this for a second. This is a subscription, it is not a contract you and ADOBE are not bound to anything, what if in say 2 months from your purchase, ADOBE decides to up the price say an unsuspecting $5.00 to their monthly fee. Then again in a year they JACK the price up $20.00 dls on their monthly fee and in another year another $30.00 on their mo. fee. You get the idea where this is going. You started at $9.99 and a year later you are now paying $30.00 a month for their application. REMEMBER if you don't pay the monthly you can not use your files. You are renting from ADOBE. Since there is no contract between the customer and ADOBE, Adobe could (not saying that they will) Jack up the price anytime they want to whatever they choose. Who's to say that they won't or will, there is no contract remember. We are at the mercy of ADOBE for our applications we use. THIS is a scary situation and its  happening before your eyes. As consumers we must be intelligent and smart when shopping for anything. Remember that ADOBE is nothing without its customers. Without us ADOBE is nothing. ADOBE should put their customers first instead of dollar signs."
all i can say is Will Ferrell
I like the anti-malware it is a very good program from Amy
"The Training video's by Kirt Kershaw of Dream Force LLC keep getting better with each training video he puts out. Excel 2010 is a very comprehensive training video broken down into small easy to follow sessions that even come with sample work sheets with data used in the training video's to follow along with. This is a great addition. Excel 2010 by Kirt Kershaw is an extensive training program. It covers everything you need to know about how to use this fun and powerful Microsoft product. If this is the first time you are using excel, Kirt takes you through the basics and if you follow all three levels of the video lessons, when you are done with this excel 2010 you will be quite efficient using the excel 2010 program and will be classified as an advanced user, the go to person for excel 2010.

Even when you finish you always have the DVD at your fingertips to review and refresh for features you do not use often but need to use now. This training DVD on Excel 2010 become an invaluable reference source.

If you are looking for a training DVD for excel 2010 or any of the Microsoft Office programs, look no further, you found it with Kirt Kershaw Excel 2010 training video. This is a wonderful learning DVD. I highly recommend this and all Kirt Kershaw training video's. This turned out to be the best investments I have made for learning excel 2010.

 I have since purchased the entire collection of Kirt Kershaw training programs include the latest Microsoft Windows 7 which I just upgraded to from Windows XP. It quickly brought me up to speed with Microsoft new operation system.

Even if you are already knowledgeable in using the Microsoft programs, you can still learn from these videos. I have watched them all from level 1 to level III, and I learned new techniques and time-saving tips that I've missed and did not know from other training videos.

Kurtz Kershaw training videos are the best out there, and his teaching style and the level of detail are unmatched in my opinion. He breaks it down and explains in detail with real world examples. Even if you have limited or no experience using the Microsoft video training programs by Kurtz from DreamForce LLC you will learn them and soon master them and become the go to person in how to use the Microsoft program you are learning.

The videos are broken down are into small and short lessons. You learn at your own pace. Even after watching the training videos, I still refer back to them often as you do a reference book when you need a refresher course or just want to review something that you haven't done in a while or for review if you didn't master them the first time.
I highly recommend, Kirt Kershaw of Dream Force LLC., training videos to anyone who is just starting out, or wants to be more proficient with the Microsoft office suite, or starting up to the new Microsoft Windows 7 operating system.
You will soon become an expert and the go to person from friends and family. Keep up the good work Kirt Kershaw and please keep those video training programs coming."
"ACD Systems FotoSlate 4 has the potential to be a really great piece of software. Unfortunately it falls short for my use. Perhaps if you want a single document with different layouts for each page and are going to do a lot of adjustments by hand then this will be just the thing for you. What I was hoping for was the ability to take a large number of images and put them on multiple pages, either 6 or 12 per page, with the images scaled and rotated properly and with the file name as the caption. It looks like the software is supposed to do that but it doesn't. There is an option to ""auto-rotate images"" but it either rotates all images (even those that didn't need to be rotated) or it doesn't rotate any. So, all images are printed in either vertical or horizontal orientation, rather than the appropriate orientation for the individual images. It is possible to manually rotate those images that are wrong but it's impossible to select multiple images so you have to do it one image at a time. That's quite time consuming when you have hundreds or thousands of images to rotate.

Although the ACD Systems web site has user forums and there is a link to submit technical questions, they seem to be either broken or simply abandoned and not actually in use. There are recent posts in the forums for other products but not for Fotoslate. Once registered you'd think I could post to the forum but that feature seems to be broken.

It's too bad, really. I wanted to like this package and it is quite close to being just what I need. But for me, it's mostly useless."
"I love the program. It makes photoshop almost unnecessary for a lot of my photos and it's very fast because you don't have to keep opening and saving.  It's easy to copy settings from one photo to another.  HOWEVER, I cannot get any minor problems addressed by the company.  I waited 10 days for them to respond to an email about an installation issue, and they only responded because I threatened to start writing reviews.  I am now waiting 4 days for a followup.  I can't get into their forums because they won't recognize me as a customer so I can't get advice that way.  I also find the interface confusing but I'm hoping they fix that in version 5.  In the meantime, unless you're confident you can figure anything out on your own, BEWARE."
This product is tremendously slow and hard to work with.  Video editing playback is jerky and freezes constantly.  I got a refund shortly after trying to work with it for a couple days.  Adobe Premier Elements is far and above a better and more powerful product.
"Note from the other reviewers that audio and video sync is a matter of luck with this product. Unfortunately I was one of the unlucky ones. With all my VHS video tape captures I saw good audio/video sync at the beginning of the tape and up to 4 seconds out of sync at the two hour mark.

I have a recent Intel 925XECV2 mother board, 3 GHZ Intel Pentium,  2GB memory, and 200 MB Western Digital drives. I am running Windows XP SP2 with updated motherboard and Pinnacle drivers. Still no luck.

I did try the Pinnacle capture program, the Studio capture method, and Vegas capture software. In all cases the audio and video went out of sync in a similar manner.

I did go to the Pinnacle support boards for this capture device to seek help. Unfortunately there are many, many posts of audio/video sync problems, and very little support from Pinnacle  to address the problem. Most of the help suggestions consist of ""update your driver"" or ""don't run other programs.""

So unfortunately after many tries, I never got the product to work, and I did not find it worth my time to debug the problem further. After many attempts, back it went to the retailer."
"This set of training videos is exactly what I needed as my accuracy at the range showed that something I was doing was wrong. When I saw that Patrick had come out with this training I had to get it. If it was anything like the quality of the seven video set I had purchased earlier, I would find the info I needed. Back at the range, the owner mentioned some things I was doing wrong, but only for a fee for his one on one instruction would he actually show me. Well, he does have to make a living too. But for me, I like being able to view and review. And there in the videos were exacty the issues I was having and the corrective measures to fix the problems."
"Vert Good Product

Highly Recommend"
"I had to write a few things to familiarize myself with the system. Once I got the hang of it, I was amazed at how easy it was to get down to work! You can backtrack events and characters, and tidy up later. I'm still finding more advantages to this program. I initially started writing a piece without breaking it into chapters first, and I still can't find a way to correct that. The software almost invites you to use it that way, but if you start your writing in chapters you can easily skip back and forth and insert thoughts and passages later on. Also, there isn't any problem inserting additional chapters in between those you may have already worked."
good
What a disappointment.  It is just a come on to purchase more cards software.  Limited selection for sure.  Very limited.  I was not aware that this so call jewel edition was a fake gem.  Special Edition of what.  Do not waste the money on this.
"I have been using this product for the past year and would now be lost without it. To promote my business I needed a web site, but did not want to pay anyone to do it for me, mainly because I wanted to be in control of things.  After looking at a number of similar packages, all of which made claims that they were quick and easy, I settled with Homestead.  It really is quick! I had a basic site up and running in under an hour.  More importantly to me was that the software can be used by a novice computer user.  Great value for money too."
My go-to program for the last 13 years for S-Corp as well as personal taxes.
It fully satisfied my needs.
I just purchased the 2009 version to upgrade from Family Tree Maker 2005. I upgraded my computer and need FTM to be compatible with Vista. What a disappointment! It is quite elegant looking but almost impossible to work with. I just want to have a look at the ancestors chart and can't even get it to come on the screen unless I want to go to the print section. Then it has to recalculate every time I change the number of generations which has to be done one at a time. That's an awful lot of effort when there are 30 generations involved. This no where near as intuitive as the old version and I'm sorry I bought it.
Did not include microsoft word or pdf
Product was as described-new and licensed. Delivery was within the described time frame.
I have been using Quickbooks for the past 7 years for both business and personal purposes. I am happy with the software and how it has helped me stay organized and knowledgeable about my finances and the finances of the companies I have worked with.
"VLC is free, open source software anyone can download for--again--free:
[...]

Kinda a shame to see someone trying to sell it to unsuspecting people.

(BTW, VLC is great, and worht more than many you DO have to really pay for.)"
Perfect software for writers. There is a learning curve associated with it but the tutorial is very thorough and really helps.
"Very happy with my items that I received, exactly as described. I would recommend this seller and there products.  Very Happy Customer and will buy from again.  Thank you!"
I found that it is very user friendly. You can create many personal and business projects and it has tons of different images.
It won't work. Keeps saying failure to process.
"I just finished writing a review for eTrust's Internet Security package after I saw the unbelievable amount of negative responses. I will not go back to Norton or Mcafee unless the mimic CA's design and usefullness. I am on my second year with this program and have nothing but wonderful things to say about it. It is does not bog my system down like the ""other"" two nor did it take a lot of space (space was not a issue for me but it helps keep the system running smoothly). Again, this program is great and I definitly recommmend it!"
Product tried to eat my computer. Never opened completely. It took me 5 mins and two fingers to type this....sigh.
"Despite all the negative reviews, I gave it a try, and I am glad I did. I would like to give it a fair review here.

I use it on my P4 1.6M Laptop with USB Midi 1x1 connector (so it works) and my Casio Keyboard. I ran it for couple days and did not see any bugs or crashes reported by other users.

This program allows everyone to learn at their own pace. You can spend more time on any song if you want to or otherwise.

One of the most amazing features of this software is letting you to import any midi song, which is all over the internet, into the program for you to practice.

This is the best $50 you can spend if you'd like to learn piano."
"Useful applications. Although dated, it works fine and does what it needs to do."
"I've noticed some of the reviews here seem to tout the features of this software, but the authors do not necessarily indicate that they have actually tried to use it, which makes me a little skeptical of their 5-star ratings.  Let me say up front that I have actually used it.  Also note that I have used quite a few different types previously, my favorite being Adobe Premiere Elements.

This version from Pinnacle is not by any means user friendly.  If you are a novice, you won't find that the process has a ""easily walks me through it"" design to it by any means.  It is, in fact, fairly difficult to do even basic things...like add titles or captions to the timeline.

You will see a tab toward the bottom called ""SmartMovie,"" that does make things a little bit simpler....but even with this option it's still not all that easy to navigate your way through the process.

Two main things about this software that I found fairly annoying:

1) If you want to view the online training videos from Pinnacle, you can only do so if you subscribe to their site for $7 per month....otherwise the video stops about a fourth of the way through and a pop-up pushes you to make this purchase.  Until you do, you're blocked from viewing the videos.

2) It does not burn to Blue-ray discs unless you download a plug-in that will allow this feature, which also costs $7 to download.  Really Pinnacle?  I mean....really?  Even the MyDVD software that comes with it has a burn to Blue-ray option on it, which is greyed out because you have not yet purchased the plug-in.  Horrible business model, IMO.

What I did manage to do was to burn a short 4GB AVCHD movie on a DVD DL disc, and I was able to include a title for it.  Oddly, the transition from one clip to another had special effects built in for switching from one clip to another...swiping from left to right, loading the next clip from the middle out, etc.  At first it was pretty cool to look at, but eventually it got annoying.  I was able to finally figure out from the manual how to go in and take the transitions out of the timeline.  It was strange to me that these special transition effects were set up by default.

When I tried to burn a larger, 10GB movie (as a side note, all of these are HD family vacation footage), of course I couldn't load it on a DVD DL disc due to its size, so I decided to save the file and then I would burn it from my Adobe software. Halfway through to exporting it to the folder, however, the Studio 20 software froze up and stopped exporting....so I had to close it.  BTW, I have a fairly robust PC....Core i7 CPU, 12GB RAM, etc.

Basically, unless you want software to make AVCHD movies less than 8.5GB in total size that will not burn to Blue-ray unless you download a plug-in at an additional cost, I would look elsewhere.  My suggestion is Adobe Premier Elements....that's the one I have had the most success with.  I can't recommend this one."
I understand this is measure to stop piracy but once we buy the software we should have the freedom to install it as many times as we went without having to report to daddy gates why we're installing the software again
don't use it much - but sure glad it's there
"I have been using computers since 1991 when I went back to college for a degree in Computer Information Systems and Certificate of Achievement in Microcomputer Applications. I have had several computers and am now using a Dell Dimension 8300 3 GHz , INTEL CPU with 2.5GB memory with XP Pro AND a Dell Vostro 1000 laptop 1.8 GHz with 1 GB memory and AMD64 CPU with XP Home.  I used McAfee starting in 1991 when it free from a bulletin board and then when it was bundled for a fee, then started using Norton Systemworks 2000 - 2005 (which all included anti-virus), Norton Professional anti-virus, Windows Live One Care, Norton Anti-Virus 3 user 2007 , 2008 and recently 2009 when I couldn't use the PC Tools Internet Security program.

I decided to try to install PC Tools Internet Security on my laptop because I keep it pretty clean, transferring files to my desktop computer.  The install disk took a very short time to install - that was nice. BUT...and this is a pretty big ""but"" for me...No matter what I did, my WLAN card was of no use -- Windows kept closing it because there ""was a problem.""  I couldn't register the program because I had no Internet -- because my wireless was not usable.  Because I could not activate the program, I could not use it for updates yet.  I could not access the Internet to find out what the problem so I could not activate the program.  A catch-22 situation.  No Internet meant no program.

I went through all of the settings and told the program to give full access to my WLAN card but it never worked.  No matter what I did I could never get to the Internet.  Made me mad.

A little aside -- when you are asked to activate the program you type in your name, your email address and the multi-alpha numeric product key.  When you click on activate, you are met with -- sorry but there is no Internet and it keeps your email address but you must re-enter your name and product key over and over as you try to register your product.

I never recognized most of the items the lists of choices showed so had no idea if I should allow or block them.  Even with the Zone Alarm Firewall I used to use I knew what most programs were for.  The software didn't seem to block my Explorer browser but did block items like Linksys EasyLink Advisor.  And I guess the program also blocked my WLAN wireless card.

As soon as I uninstalled the program -- which took two tries and two reboots, my wireless access magically came back along with the Internet.  What a relief!  But now I had no Anti-Virus protection.

The software seemed promising -- I thought there was a nice thick manual inside the box -- apparently the manufacturer thought that the heft of the box might lead buyers to think there was something in the box besides a disk.  I couldn't believe it -- a 4 1/4"" X 5 1/2"" X 1/2"" thick notepad with a link to ""special offers for retail customers.""  There was a small flyer with instructions on how to install the program and a few other instructions as well but the manual was on the disc.

Since my Norton Anti-Virus had expired (I will never again wait until my current anti-virus program expires to install a new Anti-Virus program so I can use the old one until I get another new program) I ended up downloading the free version of AVG and going to Costco to buy Norton Anti-Virus/3-user software so I wouldn't be without protection on my two computers.  No waiting until low sale prices with rebates or anything a/c I was desperate.

I see by the other reviews that most were able to use the program after any difficulties.  Maybe they are all IT's or MIT graduates.  Programs shouldn't be this difficult.  I thought the program should be more intuitive and not block everything on your computer so you can't even use it.  People complain about Symantec's Norton Anti-Virus but I like all of the programs I have used except their Internet Security from 2004 -- it just slowed down my computer as well as others in my family including one who had a BS degree in Computer Science and a LOT of work experience with computers."
"GOOD JOB

it's the solution
"I just replace Finale 2011 with Sibelius 7, and am stunned at the difference.  Once I got past the steepest part of the learning curve, it has become obvious that Sibelius' system of entering notes and the general way of doing things is significantly easier and faster than Finale.  I'm sold!"
"I never thought I'd be able to carry a library around with me. This application replicates the ""book experience"" flawlessly, but with the option to read any book in your library in the middle of the night, w/o breaking into the local library. Another plus?

"This program seems to work well enough, but I wouldn't, based on my experience, recommend putting it in your startup folder unless you are a real computer whiz. It will take over your computer and if you try to get it out of there it may cause a big mess. That's what happened the FIRST time I tried to use the program.

Then I found out you can't use both the English and the Spanish versions on the same machine. You can't use more than one copy of DNS on one machine. When I bought the Spanish version (after purchasing the English one), I found this out the hard way. The rep did not tell me though that if you just get the Spanish one, you can make a profile in English and Spanish using just that one. Things would have been a lot easier if she had. When I got my machine into a mess trying to put the Spanish version on, I called them and another rep essentially told me that you can only use one language at the time. The gist of it was from what he said, one language, one machine. This turned out not to be true. Later, I had to uninstall my English copy and it wouldn't uninstall properly, so I called them again. The rep sent me a link to download a removal tool which worked fine. That particular representative was extremely knowledgeable and very helpful. While I had him on the phone I mentioned the bilingual problem and THEN I was told that the Spanish version will let you set up profiles in both languages. Well, I now have the Spanish version installed on my machine and it works fine for both languages.

So, in my experience their customer rep department is batting 33%. Or however you say it.

The program itself is not difficult to learn but it will perform SIGNIFICANTLY better if you have copious amounts of written documents and e-mails on your computer that have the same sort of vocabulary that you use. It goes out looking for these when you first ""train"" the program, and the more that is available, the better the program will recognize what you are saying. Otherwise, you have to train it more frequently."
"I cannot comment on this item because I never received it.  The seller was pulled a scam. However, Amazon was great at refunding my money right away.  Thank you, Amazon. I'm glad to know that I can be confident about making a purchase and not getting taken advantage of."
"Although I am no expert in this field, I have found a few bugs in the program, but so far exporting the audio and re-importing it has solved all the issues I have ran into.  I have no real experience with other audio recording software other than light use of audacity and an older Cakewalk Home Studio 9.  I do wish it had better tools for mixing but it does plenty for its price."
Same review as everyone else. Doesn't work consistently. Randomly highlights all your dictated text and deletes it. Waste of $60.
Like the program
"I bought printshop 4 and took it back 1 hour later. Terrible, like the other comments I have always used printshop would work wonderful on my old PC. Not now, I think they lost the program. Plus it's a little shady when you have to jump through hoops to contact them."
"For would-be professional singers or even ""American Idol"" wannabes there are superior singing programs out there, but this sure seems to be the one that provides the most fun. This package is ideal for people who perhaps have never had a singing lesson ever and who have a hankering to improve their singing while having some fun in the process.

The software adjusts to each individual's vocal range, and the program begins with some valuable warm-up exercises. The interface employing a talking microphone, a singing squid, and the cute-and-sassy ""Carry A Tune"" female student character is clearly geared for children, but it's certainly fine for teens and adults, as well.

The lessons start VERY easy, and gradually work up to more demanding tasks about halfway through.  Yes, it's a bit hokey to begin with ""Hot Cross Buns,"" but the point here is that one must crawl before one walks or runs, and the use of very simple tunes allows singers to concentrate on getting just a few notes right before moving on to more complex note sequences.

The theory behind the lessons is that by providing an onscreen guide to notes that tracks the actual frequencies associated with the singer's voice, the student can learn to control the notes through a kind of self-adjustment feedback process.  There are no miracles promised here, however, and if a person has an inborn tendency to waver or wander off key, I really doubt that the twenty lessons provided in the program will totally eradicate these problems.

However, seeing where and how one has a tendency to miss notes is, in fact, helpful, and the learning process can be augmented through slowing down the inherent beats of songs.  Once one masters the note changes while singing slowly, the metronome speed can be gradually increased.  This is a very useful feature!

What makes this package even more enjoyable is that the program doubles, essentially, as a vehicle for karaoke.  One can download up to twelve free MIDI with lyrics songs from the program's own website.  These files are set up in the same way as the lesson tunes, i.e., with words on screen and a tune/pitch guide that the singer follows as he or she sings the song. The choices of free songs is pretty limited, but fortunately, there also are links to a few MIDI karaoke resources where there are hundreds of additional songs available. These can be purchased at what I think are reasonable prices, and this way a user can establish as large a library of singalong while training files as one likes.

Yes, the microphone headset provided is cheap, but it's actually quite adequate for the task at hand (and as an environmental science teacher, let me assure people that the ""lead hazard"" warnings are a kind of pro forma thing; only if you chew on the microphone are you likely to have any chance of experiencing ill health effects here).  The sensitivity of the microphone is not impressive, but it's good enough for training purposes, and one can always purchase a higher-quality mike if need be.

Overall, I think this program is a terrific value.  It provides some real vocal training for beginners, turns itself into a kind of self-contained karaoke machine, and best of all, it's FUN!  Highly recommended"
Exactly what the doctor ordered.
"If you have to do it - pay taxes, that is - and you do. Turbo Tax makes it easy."
This is great. Just great. Provides you with much of what you want to do in regular Photoshop at an affordable price. Easy to use and fun.
"This is a very capable product and the best available for the money. Two caveats, however.

1) It is not a full fledged, do anything architectural program, so you will not be able to design highly complicated structures. But it will allow you to create and view building designs. I have done so for an addition and my contractor is impressed with the renderings, both 2D and 3D. They are everything he needed for permits, construction, etc.
2) Like any complicated program there is a learning curve. But given the capability of the program that is to be expected. One cannot use any complicated graphic program without spending a little time learning how to use it.

I do not understand the negative comments made by some reviewers. I tried several other similar programs and found them less functional nor as user friendly. Home Designer Suite is an excellent program for basic home building design."
"I can't believe how awful this product performs. I've used turbo tax for years and never had any issues. I've re-installed this version 3 times and followed all of the trouble shooting guides, but it still crashes my computer without warning every 5 minutes!  As if doing taxes weren't bad enough, starting them over again and constantly rebooting the computer is the worst. Needless to say, I bought the product a month ago and still don't have my taxes filed.

My advice: buy the hard copy version of the software and skip the download."
"I was VERY pleased with this year's Turbo Tax purchase.  I LOVE that they added It's Deductible into the total package.  Their price was very affordable for that (for those that like the TurboTax and Quicken programs).  [...]  The instructions are clearer than ever, the online chat help was actually pretty quick, even when I logged on during peak activity time.  GREAT product. The detraction of 1 star was due to the fact that they didn't offer rebates this year for any filing fees.  The price of the product was GREAT, don't get me wrong (Fed, State and It's Deductible),[...].  And yes, I know there are free filing tax softwares out there, so maybe I'll look into them.  But if you don't mind spending the little bit of money (it is deductible, too) for all of the features, it's well worth it for the ease and security."
"Slot game is very realistic. Slot game options are great.  Having lots of fun as along as the funds don't run out.  Like all PC slots, when you run out of money, you can buy more."
I received the product within a 10-day period.  I was completely satisfied with it.
Very good job.
"I haven't much experience with this yet but it is very ""trimmed"" down from the ""full"" version but for more money I can upgrade."
"I just finished national novel writing month and this company was one of the sponsors.  It has been getting glowing reviews all around so I thought to purchase it and use it to edit my less than organized novel.
Cannot go to the activation url as provided by Amazon [...]  This is beyond frustrating and I am not a happy camper.  This receives one star because there is nothing below this rating.
A word to the wise; purchase this item elsewhere or not at all!"
"This is my first modification on any type of computer. In fact, I did it incorrectly, and it still worked. What I mean is, you are supposed to download the driver (CDROM or online) and then install the card. Windows XP recognized it immediately and it works as advertised at 480 Mbits/sec. If you must know just one important thing about USB 2.0, remember not to unplug the peripheral device when the PC is on. Power down first, then unplug the device, be it printer, digital camera, external HD, or cordless microphone. It could result in a crash and/or data loss (Thanks to Christine for this word of advice)."
This software was easy to buy and easy to download and set up
pain in the butt to learn still trying to get a hold of the idea it is nothing like picture it
Bueno
"Designer Pro 8 has corrected several bugs with the 3d rendering and does not crash when the image is revolved.  Additional add on items are appreciated.

Adapting to the new menu bar layout is easy and after a couple of time becomes fairly intutive.

For ease of use, I highly recommend this product"

"About the time Windows Vista came out, I switched to Macs. For the most part, I never found myself wanting for software offerings unless it was (1) a game or (2) genealogy software. Sure, there was Mac software, but it just didn't appeal to me like FTM for PC did. When a version was finally released for the Mac a few years ago, I was ecstatic, only to be thoroughly disappointed when it turned out to be something like a port of a PC version from years before, and wouldn't even read the PC database file without a sketchy conversion process. Finally, with FTM 3, PC and Mac users are on more or less equal footing. Perhaps the most notable improvement, and the one which appeals to me most, is the fact that the database file is finally ""native"" for the Mac version. I was able to easily put my PC file on a flash drive and open it with FTM for Mac 3, make some changes, save, and then open it back up on my PC. In fact, I can now just store the file in my DropBox folder and open it on whichever computer I happen to be near. Though I really only have a PC for gaming, I can now comfortably abandon FTM for the PC secure in the knowledge that if something should ever happen and I need access to FTM on a PC, I don't have to jump through any hoops to make things work. I can e-mail the database file to relatives who have a PC without having to worry about losing data in a conversion (and they can send their PC files just as easily). It really is a game-changer for me, and I'm glad I've stuck with FTM long enough to finally see this development (though it should have come years earlier)."
"My seven-year-old son was so excited by this product. Dad and son have spent hours together modding Minecraft with it.  His first mod was to create his own custom sword and he was ecstatic. Dad liked the fact that he and his son had something we could do together that was a significant bonding experience.  Well thought-out, and easy to work with, this is a product I HIGHLY recommend if you have a child who is a fan of Minecraft. Can''t say enough good things about this software. (Works with Mac OSX too!)"
Worked well!
Very Satisfied.
"Got it to help with college, works great!"
"Being a heavy, long-time user of free online mapping services as such google maps, I've found Microsoft Streets & Trips 2009 a valuable alternative that's worth the price. Granted, the software takes a bit of time to load. Once launched, it's fast. Mapping is instantaneous and accurate. It has tons of features that are not available in the free online services, such as saving trip data to files for future use. I have mostly positive experience using the software.

Pros:
Fast mapping (after initial software launch)
Ability to use it offline
Ability to interface it with a GPS
No annoying advertisements

Cons:
Not free
No online core update to the map
Have to bring the notebook PC/software with you"
It didn't work for 10 devices.
"upgrading to windows 10 the software failed to conect, send an e-mail and didn't have an answer back. Can't install the software it gives error"
Its ok not as well fitting as I hoped
Great Product . Easy to use. The Fast way to get your refund.
Works great
"I wanted a new and improved Astronomy program to replace Redshift 4.  This program appeared to have some of the bells and whistles I previously had in Redshift 4 plus some more.  While the graphics are very good in this program and telescope control support is excellent, it lacks a LOT of frills.  There isn't much of a picture database, there isn't a printed manual, you can't ""fly"" around the solar system to different reference points, you can't zoom into the solar system planets for a realistic representation of what you'll see thru the telescope.  I wish I would have bought Starry Night Pro Plus. It appears to be a more polished product."
Product was easily installed and performed as expected.  This is a great product for those that do not have a tablet or traveling with a computer and not wanting to carry the extra weight of a tablet or book.
This is a great software.  It has everything you need to run your business!
have been using H&R block for over 10 years. Software just works for me.
overpriced
"This can be a huge time saver. Make sure though that you have a good mic. There are some recommendations online for mics that work well with this software. It does however sometimes trouble recognizing certain phrases despite extensive training such as ""there are"". Still I would definitely recommend this."
"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Turbocad-LTE-v3/dp/B00446CFF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Turbocad LTE v3</a>+I have been delaying this review until the company corrected a glitch in the program, but it has been almost three months without resolution. It is past time to warn other shoppers.

The program is IMSI's DoubleCAD drafting program with a different user interface to make it look and work like AutoCAD. Great idea, because no amateur can justify the staggering price of AutoCAD. I was an AutoCAD user for over 20 years and, now retired, had AutoSketch on my Windows XP home computer. When I got a new computer with Windows 7, it would not run the old program. They quit making AutoSketch, so TurboCAD LTE seemed like my best bet. I didn't want to have to learn a new interface.

The program loaded and started ok with just two problems. The Help button brought up an error message instead of opening an interactive help feature like all other ordinary programs. This started a long and unproductive series of telephone and e-mail exchanges with ISMI's so-called Technical Support. They finally quit responding to my calls and e-mails so I contacted Customer Service. They were courteous and apparently trying to help, but so far without sucess. I think that Technical Support is stonewalling them too.

It appears that ISMI has made a market decision not to support this program. They have a forum for other programs but none for this. They could fix the flaw in the program that prevents the operation of the Help function. I am convinced that it is a minor programming error. I was able to get enough information from the DoubleCAD forum, but not from Technical Support, to fix the other glitch that was keeping another feature from working properly.  It is a pity, because it is a nice program to use otherwise.

Although I cannot, in good conscience, recommend anyone buying this product, I secretly hope many of you will. Then we can convince ISMI to support it."
Very good
"This item did not meet my expectations, I was unable to print out my forms well. The program worked fine but when it came time to print it would not print anything on some forms so after printing many copies I just wrote out by hand everthing that was missing on the forms so it became even more tedious and long process..:("
"First let me start out by saying my husband has a degree in Micro Computer Systems and I am an exIBMer of 10 years.  My husband did a deep scan using System Mechanic and was given a result that said he needed to repair a start up problem. So regretfully he allowed it to go in and do a fix!  He was never able to get back on his computer again until he had to reformat his hard drive and lose everything on there.  THE Worst part was the customer help or lack of!!!!! We were told that a program engineer would have to be consulted and it would be about 3 days before they would get back to us.  They never did, and when I tried to email them I would get stupid replies like go to start click and then choose control panel.....blah.....blah...blah.  Can they not read!!! We can't even get into safe mode, your program has wiped out something in the start up program and we can't get passed looking at the bios info.  Anyway, after a couple of ridiculous replies I told them not to bother any more that it was evident that they did not have the technical ability to handle the problem and they definitely weren't going to help us even though it was their problem.  I wouldn't recommend this program to anyone.  They have a lot of fancy graphics to make you think their progam is really doing something great.  Now tell me after I do a check on my computer and it replies I need to do this and that I allow it to and then the next day I basically get the same you need to fix this and that again.  It's just a bunch of junk.  If you buy this program even after reading this, all I can say is please be careful."
As described
Best product out there.  We've tried them all and never a problem.  We run malware free on all of our computers with Webroot.
"I got the opportunity to use Quickbooks 2008 recently for a nonprofit and having absolutely no accounting background, I was worried about the power of the program and how I could even get started.  Wow, was I surprised!  This software walked us through every aspect of our business and even has a ""coach"" tool that helped me when I was trying to determine the steps needed for things from entering a donation to creating a sales order and receiving stock!  If you have held off in purchasing this software because of price, I believe it's well worth the current price if not several times the same!"
"I am looking forward to this publication. I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but am looking forward to that opportunity. I can only HOPE that it is not put together in speech, as I am Deaf. If it is, I will have to get someone to listen for me. My Daughters are hearing, so when I see them, I'll get them to listen."
"Oh my gosh------ Rosetta Stone.  My poor husband has been attempting to learn immersion with Rosetta Stone whilst I've been away for many many months. I speak fluent French and I was initially impressed with the fact that he wanted to learn whilst I was away.  Since being back with him, and listening to the Rosetta Stone, I realise how it's quite ridiculous and must be so hard for a beginner to follow.  It's so convoluted and doesn't have any real order.  It delves into something very advanced and they expect you to know.  I thought the audio was crazy and way too complicated to follow.  I would not recommend this teaching tool."
Does what is suppose to. Does not seem to have excessive system overhead.
"To begin with, I am an old fan of the original Land of the Lost TV series. I am also not a fan of Will Farrell. Yet I was willing to give this thing a chance. I almost wish I hadn't. The best thing I can say about the film is that it was not as bad as the reviews led me to believe. The fact remains that it is still a terrible film in almost every way.
The cheesiest thing in the film was how they worked the original lyrics of the opening theme into the script and then later had Will Farrell sing a terrible version of it as if to slam us over the head that this was supposed to be based on a beloved television series. The overly-intelligent dinosaurs were an insult to the intellect of the viewer. The story of the rivalry between Enik and the Zarn seemed artificially grafted into the film instead of being an integral part of it. Personally, I was miffed that they made Enik a megalomaniacal villain (he was originally a neutral character helping the Marshalls for his own selfish but understandable reasons) and the Zarn into the victimized guardian. In fact, they completely changed the nature of the Zarn altogether (originally he was a being made of colored lights who was sensitive to human thought and emotion and was more neutral than evil).
The story runs that disgraced physicist Rick Marshall has invented a machine which can open a doorway in time and space. A grad student named Holly convinces him to to build it and they use it to open a portal to the land of the lost, inadvertently taking a tour-guide biker named Will along with them. Once in the Land of the Lost, they rescue Chaka, a Pakuni prince, from being sacrificed by userpers of his throne. Rick Marshall acts superior to everyone and everything in this place, which pisses off Grumpy, the genius T-rex who, for some reason, understands English. We also have no good explanation why working with Chimps has made Holly fluent in Chaka's language. After lots of bad jokes based on the original series, they find the Lost City of the Sleestak. They included the message scrawled on one of the rocks ""beware of Sleestak"" from the original TV show without explaining it properly. They have been led here psychically by Enik who is trapped inside. Enik tells them that his people's mortal enemy, the Zarn, is planning a Sleestak invasion of Earth. Rick must find his device which was lost when they entered the Land of the Lost in order to defeat the Zarn and get home again. It just goes downhill from here. The film ends with Rick Marshall and Holly falling in  love, Rick Marshall making friends with Grumpy, the T-rex (Grumpy was grumpy because of an intestinal blockage. Don't ask how it gets fixed), and Will remaining behind with Chaka and his people. And the invasion, which is really being planned by Enik, is stopped.
What really gets me is that the original television series has a number of episodes which could have been strung together and, with a bit of tweaking, become a nice two-hour film: The Marshall family is vacationing in the Grand Canyon when an earthquake accidentally opens a time doorway to the Land of the Lost. They make friends with Chaka who helps them get through the first few weeks of their exile. They discover the Pylons and the Lost City teeming with Sleestaks - and mabe have a run-in with Captain Colli and his canon, Sarah. Deep inside the Lost City they find Enik in his secure cave. He agrees to help them, but it is a trick. By falling into the Land of the Lost, they have caused a paradox. They go through the doorway, fixing the paradox and fall back into the Land of the Lost again. But all is not lost. Chaka takes Rick Marshall to see a special ritual performed by Ta, the Pakuni elder which opens a time dooway in one of the pylons. Rick Marshall steps inside, ignoring Chaka's attempts to stop him. Meanwhile, Holly and Will go out hunting for their dad only to be confronted by a ghostly image of Holly. The Ghost beckons them into a cave where they are forced to help alternate versions of themselves and their father who are stuck in a wall by completing a circuit of crystals in a matrix table. When the smoke clears, they find themselves outside with Chaka running to get them. They follow chaka to the Travelling Pylon just in time for the door to open and Rick Marshall to step out with the news that the pylon is their ticket home. Next morning, they get inside the pylon and the last part of the film includes a series of stops on alternate worlds and times. Finally, they climb out of the pylon in a remote part of the Grand Canyon. An old, wreck of a car leads them to believe that they are in the wrong place until around a corner comes a troup of tourists on the backs of donkeys. I would maybe include Mrs. Rick Marshall as well as a female guide for Will to ogle.
The point is that this film should have been a reverent, serious sci-fi epic rather than a cheesy satire which puts down the original source material every chance it could get.
Bottom line, I would not recommend this film to anyone. Especially if you are a fan of the original series. Stay away!"

I've tried my laptop from work just to make sure it's not my internet connection and guess what?  That laptop works just fine, and I know it's because it doesn't have Norton install. Now I am forced to bite the bullet and purchase another product. Oh, and if you go to the website on the box to claim a refund...there are at least 7 items that'll say why you are unable to qualify for a refund, unless ""Mr. Symantec handed it to you himself and you have proof....""

I am glad I am keeping up with technology though I wish capitalism wasn't being abused so much but still I am loving this upgrade!
I've used Family Tree Maker for years.  This was a great opportunity to upgrade at a price I could afford. It picked  up the information I already had on a previous version flawlessly.  I like the way it is set up and the ease of use.  I also love the way it interfaces with Ancestry.com which enables me to add information and vital records from the internet.  I'm very happy with this purchase.

It was OK for the week or so that I only read on my PC.
BUT > > >  and this is a big one.
When I got my phone back, the PC version would never go to last page read.
It was even a challenge to pull the book up, and manually go to the last page read.
I've given up on using Kindle on the PC, and will do my reading on an old tablet, or my phone from now on."
"I did not read the ad as closely as I thought I had. Federal + efile + state, however if you want to file the state it's an additional $20.

"I purchased this product as an upgrade from a much older version.  Calendar Creator 12 is useless for my purposes here at the church.

Newer ISN'T ALWAYS BETTER when they remove functions that you need."
"Windows 7 ultimate was a wise choice for the following two reasons.  First of all, it was not necessary to transfer everything off the old computer.  To do a simple upgrade you are required to own the same version home premium to home premium, as an example. With Windows 7 ultimate that is not be consideration.  Secondly, Bitlocker is a great product that allows you to encrypt the data stored on your computer or on your flash drive, which allow me the comfort to store more private data on my flash drive.  Windows 7 in general is a great upgrade from Windows Vista, faster start and faster shut downs are only beginning.  When listing benefits for reasons to upgrade.  Also comes with disks for 32-bit and 64-bit."

"Extremely disappointing ""upgrade.""  I've been using Quicken since 1994, but this version is extremely ""buggy.""  Simple commands fail to execute.  Downloads fail.  Accounts are difficult to establish.  Etc.  Etc.  I can't understand how it can be that the software works worse today than it did in 1994.  Obviously, the Quicken of today has many more features than it did 22 years ago, but that enhanced functionality is worthless if the software isn't reliable and functional.  Unfortunately, it isn't.

I gather Quicken has recently been sold by Intuit to its management and a private equity firm. I hope they invest the resources necessary to get Quicken back on track."
"All this product contains is training on how to use Dreamweaver CS5 - not Dreamweaver CS5 itself.  It's great for learning the basics because the videos are brief with clear screenshots and narration that's subtitled.  It also goes over principles and essentials of web design.

I recommend this course, but it is mostly good groundwork for beginners to intermediate users."
Fun program. Has lots of quilt patters and you can mix the blocks.  It is user friendly and it will calculate the size.  You can also add borders.  It has a nice selection of colors and material to use.  Wish you could scan fabric into the data base but for the price it is great.
"Great product, but needs support of newer OpenGL versions, as I cant run some games on it. It requires me to have 20, which is strange, so I will just fill it with this."
"It was indeed Level2 , I was expecting Level 1 would be included. Disappointed"
Good product!
Purchased Fed and State from you.  Had to pay State to Intut again for the State before they would e-file it.  Did not recognize my purchase from you.  For that reason I would not recommend a purchase from you.  Also over priced!!  T
"I'm on my second year's subscription on this product, and as of right now I cannot recommend it at all.  PIA promises to not log your activity which is very important to me, but that doesn't matter all that much when the client randomly disconnects and the ""kill switch"" safety feature doesn't work.

Also, with one of the more recent updates, even using PIA has become a problem without using a third-party TAP driver because doing so renders my offline computer usage extremely sluggish.  Right now I have to use an older client with a third party OpenVPN driver just to be able to connect.  The product has become unreliable, something I would understand if it were a free service.  But I paid forty dollars for a year's subscription and I don't appreciate the product I paid for not working properly.  They update their product and in so doing they break their product.  And their promise not to log your activity doesn't matter when it randomly disconnects, the kill switch doesn't work, and the whole reason you're even using their product in the first place is being broadcast to anyone who wants to see it, complete with your real IP address.

If PIA fixes their product I'll happily remove this negative review, but not one moment before.  If you're looking for a reliable VPN with safety features that actually work, avoid Private Internet Access and go find something else."
"Doesn't work, yes you can go to your Microsoft account, download and install just fine! Then you aren't supposed to have to activate it you should be able to bypass the product key, well NO!!!! It says we have 15 free days then need to pay. Well what did I just spend $149 on!!!!! UGH Hate it, hate it, hate it. Don't waste your money!!!"
"Not sure how much more protected I am with this, but better safe than sorry."
It does not work the way I supposed should be working it make to many mistakes and it is hard to work with it
Just what I needed. Nice Price
"I installed this suite on an IBM with a stripped hardrive and only Pro 2000 operating system present .  I could not have been happier.  Word provides much more versatility than the Works word processor and is wonderfully integrated as a companion to task launcher and enhanced spreadsheet capability.  Digital photography is fun with Picture It! however I ended up using Pixela from Sony most of the time as a more convenient application for my camera. Encarta is always first class and Money took a long time to update my records for the year from scratch...but was easy,accurate and intuitive to use.  I just bought a new computer with Home Edition XP and am terrified to install this suite which duplicates many areas of XP...but I really miss using Word and will tough it out with some of the problems others have experienced.  This is a great product!"
"Had all the roads and tiny village alley's of Spain.
DID NOT LIKE.  I'm in Spain for 16 days, using 12 different hotels and inns during a 2900 mile driving tour.  Garmin map knew of two of the hotels, the rest it did not.  REALLY?  This hotel (when I found them) were at minimum 130 years old and one had been a hotel since 1632.  It's not like hotels were built this last year ... several predated the American Revolutionary War.  Google phone got us to each and every hotel, and garmin took us to the village and street ... then google took over ... repeatedly.  ALSO, we went to 5 neolithic cave sights to enjoy cave paintings.  All caves have a known name for 50 or more years, and all the caves predate the last ice age. Again, no location was new and all pre-date the pyramids.  Again, Garmin Maps did not know the names of 4 of the 5 caves.  The one it did know ... pretty funny, it took us on a rough COW cart road for 440 meters to the back entrance of that site, and not the front entrance where there was a 300 car and 14 large buses parking lot. We arrived, but I'm glad I was using a rental.  By and large the garmin map worked, but certainly has not been updated for Spain in the last 50 YEARS.  Get on it Garmin!"
"The book I purchased worked for the first 4 chapters then never loaded again. I tried re downloading it, but it never worked. I basically wasted 60 dollars."
"This is the Federal only.  Most people will need the Federal + State version.

Support is nonexistent if you run into problems.  I purchased the additional $40 for state download, but it didn't install successfully and have waited for support for 30+ minutes on 3 separate occasions."

"Sorry to hear that the 360 is being phased out. Now they have like 6 different software offerings. Guess they didn't learn anything from Intuit tax software offerings. Support still sucks. No one speaks English thou they try, Don't we have any American techs anymore. Think I will give McAfee a try when this Norton expires. Lots a luck if you need support"
"I have had an extremely frustrating morning trying to work out how to use this software, which is the worst I have ever tried.  I bought it, trying to avoid all the annoying popups that come with Quicken, but would rather suffer those than struggle with this immensely difficult to use program"

"Pure crap equipment....take my advice and DO NOT PURCHASE!  Hard to get this item to work with Windows 10 even after you download a patch...Audio drop outs and lousy video quality.  SHAME, SHAME, SHAME on you Corel for foisting such crap on the public!"
"What else is there to say about it... it does the job.  I think last year's version had better help texts, but this year updating is easier and faster. YMMV..."
Worked great! Just had to call into microsoft in order to activate the product key but other than that went as planned
"I purchased this item for a school project several years ago and was extremely disappointed when I misplaced it. The children at the school where I worked really enjoyed playing the game and it was very educational as well.  Now that I am a new grandmother, I wanted my grand daughter to enjoy it as well.  I'm sure she will have fun too!"
Love Norton
"I have used Street Atlas 2010 (SA) with a netbook quite extensively during a recent 5500 mile trip through Canada and the US.
Basically it is a very helpful tool. The file management could be easier if DeLorme had followed the Windows standards. Until you get to a 'save as' function you need to go through some tabs in SA. Also with the Earthmate LT40 GPS receiver there have been quite a few cases where the indication 'Off Route' occurred. Clearly the LT40 is much better than many other USB GPS receivers. It is terrible to hear 'Off route, recalculating' from the netbook while actually being on the correct and precalculated route.
SA is a good product but don't buy the old version."

"I really would like to have a piece of software that does what this product (and Mr. Snappy) claim to do.

"What a great product. I never have a problem with my desktop PC and the computers in the rest of the house with Norton Security Deluxe. It automatically scans my computer for viruses. If I am surfing the net, it is scanning the items I am browsing and if there is a problem, it notifies me and fixes it automatically. What more can you ask for. Will buy again when the license expires next year."
not like the old version
"I purchased the Roxio Photosuite 8 and Videowave 8 Premier only to learn that it will not under any circumstances work with Windows 7.  I have had Photosuite 4 for many years and recent updates to Microsoft and Windows caused it to crash and stop working, even reinstalling it does not help.  So I thought I'd buy this product and get back to doing what I do for the church again and was very very disappointed to find it wouldn't work because Windows 7 requires, nay...DEMANDS ...digitally signed drivers which this product does not provide and it caused my system to crash 2 times as a result.  When I went to Roxie looking for solutions to the problem all I got was an invitation to purchase a newer product that costs  more.  Not at all happy."
"It took roughly 40 min to install and configure the OS. I had no problems and found that most of my drivers, including my Radeon 1600 and printer were installed automatically. My sound card is the only driver I had to update manually. Creative labs has a new beta Vista driver that works quite well. I love the new interface, and find a significant increase in overall speed. The 3D view is pretty cool, but not really useful. The graphics overall are awesome. I love the gadgets, which by the way does not seem to increase CPU usage. I successfully installed Norton antivirus and TurboTax with no issue. Overall, Vista for home use seems well worth the price. (I purchased the academic premium version for. $69.00)"
Quickbooks is great for a small business.  However different versions for different numbers of users can get confusing but after installing it does everything we need.
"Unlike Final Draft, Movie Magic is properly supported, and for free, for registered users of this software.
Movie magic will also allow the user to have their screenplay as formally or as skeletally formatted as the user wishes by using the Edit  > Format property sheet. So if anyone doesn't want to have (continued) continued for action breaking across a page they can exclude or include that particular formatting detail. They can also switch off and on as many toolbars and speedbars as they wish. So you can have the application window all `bells and whistles' or as skinny as possible.
It is a good idea to spend some time with the Edit > Format page and Printer Setup page to get a better insight to Movie Magic's flexibility. And users should keep up to date with the latest upgrades - for free to registered users - to avail themselves of any improvements to performance and elimination of bugs."
"ERRORS ERRORS ERRORS ERRORS ERRORS ERRORS!!!! Spend more time 'fixing' downloads(from my financial accounts) than I do actually using Quicken. I've been a Quicken user for 25 years and the last 2 versions have had this problem. I have several friends that use Quicken and have the same problem. Support can help, but I GUARANTEE the problems will return. I will not buy Quicken again unless these issues atr fix, permanently..."
"I purchased 360 Computer Maid a while back and was happy with the service. However, somehow I missed a lot of the updates (I think the notices went to my junk mail!). I went online and found they were up to version 4.0! As an early subscriber, I was still using version 1.2.2.2! I contacted support and they responded to my email promptly with a download link. For some reason, it didn't work. For the next several days we went back and forth trying to find a solution. They didn't stop until my problem was resolved. They were prompt, professional and tenacious. Not only did they solve my problem but they uncovered an issue on their end. They  fixed the problem, uploaded the new version to their site and notified past clients of the change. I am a corporate trainer and one of the courses I teach is customer service. They went above and beyond to ensure my satisfaction. I will be using this as a positive example in my classes going forward. As customers, we need to to acknowledge good customer service as quickly as we do poor service.

When I did get the product working, I ran a scan, it fixed a ton of errors and upon restarting my computer, the change was immediate. My computer booted up faster and a lot of the small issues I'd been having were gone. This is a great product. Like the other review posted, I've tried different registry cleaners and this one by far is the best."
"Great software, linked ""Block Base"" and ""2016 Fabric Stash"" to it. Wow."
Will not load.  Keeps asking me to download and install.  I hate it.  Worthless don't buy this.
"Upgraded from Quicken Deluxe 2009... I like I can add file copies of my bills and statements. I like that I can Sync to my mobile device. I don't like that transactions require two distinct steps to clear or reconcile a transaction. I had hoped that Quicken would have provided the ability to copy and past by left clicking in a field and right clicking to paste as with all other programs. Having to hit the ""Edit Tab"" and pasting is so pass."

"Though it's not flawless, it does get the job done pretty well. Suffering from severe carpal in my right hand, it's helped relieve the stress on my hand by allowing me to come up with 1st drafts for articles fairly easily. It has its quirks including on typing ""he"" when I say ""I"" sometimes, but overall I have to say I'm satisfied with it.

I however do wish that it would immediately jump to an edit point immediately, rather than having to scan through the entire paragraph to get to the point where I want to edit a word. It's a big time waster and I just insert the cursor using my mouse, which kind of defeats the point of the software."
"I've been using TaxCut for six years. It is ok to deal with simple tax return. But, these few years I have to file two states and foreign tax credit and AMT. I felt I got lost, especially this year:

1. Need to re-enter numbers from one state's to the other state's tax return.
TaxCut won't do it for you. Not too difficult. I just need to print them out and look for the numbers and reentered them.
2. On Form 1116 (Foreign Tax Credit), I have to fill in 3a-3g by myself. I tried to learn from my 2006's return, which TaxCut did it for me. There is no glue how and where those numbers came from.
3. The error check on AMT and Form 1116 are not clear. I've been having difficulty for this part for the last three years. I kept on try-and-error and fixed them finally. Still not yet for Form 1116 for 2007.
4. I got onto their chat channel and waited for 15 minutes. An agent got on chat and left right away. Waited for another 10 minutes; she connected again. Without saying anything,
 I got disconnected right away. A e-mail was sent to me with case number. I tried to log into chat again but didn't find where to enter the case number.
Great! I will try again tomorrow and reenter all information.

I will definitely try some other software next year. Any good suggestions?"

"You, as Nancy Drew, embark on a journey to discover where Jake Hurley's lost mine is. On the train, who Lori Girard's (a very rich and, uh, doesn't have a lot upstairs girl) father owns, you are accompanied with John Grey, an actor on the TV show, Ghost Hunters; Tino Balducci, a ""#1"" cop who just happened to be in the right place at the right time when he nabbed those criminals; Charleena Purcell, who writes romance novels; and the legendary HARDY BOYS!!

  Throughout the course of the mystery, you solve many puzzles. Most are easy. Then, you wait until you get to your destination: Copper Gourge. This is where Jake Hurley, the man who originally owned the train now owned by Lori's father, buried his wife, Camille, who died on the train while the couple were heading to Jake's lost mine.

  I recommend this Nancy Drew game, and any of the other 13 Nancy Drew mysteries, to all!"
Its same as what I found and downloaded for free.
Not very user friendly; spent hours trying to make a nice slide show. Ended up not using the software after all--waste of money
love my tunes
"This is a really good product, with some bugs and challenges.  First, and although it's only a one time issue, wow, did it take a long time to load.  Once up and running I found it was similar to previous generations and therefore pretty easy and intuitive to use.

I am not a professional photographer so my needs are limited, and this more than met anything I wished to do.  I am not sure if you are using x6 right now, as a casual user, there are enough improvements to really warrant the upgrade, but if you have a version older than that, you owe it to yourself to see what's on X7 and how easy it is to use."
"I've used many types of appointment scheduling programs in my day, but none of them come close to the Customer Appointment Manager. The program is so easy to use it's insane. There are useful tools to help you schedule and find appointment information in a blink of an eye. It also lets me select what customer and appointment information I want to see in the reports. You can email appointment reminders and create custom letters which my customers love. The program is just so great I could go on and on. Anyone who schedules appointments definitely needs to check this out."
Simple to use and Web site has great videos explaining features
"Jan Kabili is and amazing lady!!!! I have taken many Adobe Photoshop training courses and the best up until now were Deke McClelland's(He is also very good.) Then I purchased Jan Kabili's Photoshop CS4 Essential Training course and it litterly blew me away!!! She has a great way of presenting Photoshop and making it very learnable. She also has a great listening voice!!! The program is very well organized and laid out in chapters, that you can bookmark and play over and over again, until this vast amount of information sinks in! She takes a very intense Adobe CS4 program and simplifies it so anyone can get it! All the important aspects of Adobe Photoshop CS4 are covered. I played it through once, then I played it through again, while pausing to take notes so I can compile a notebook of ""Keypoints"" that will cover all the aspects of Photoshop.
If I could rate it higher than five stars, I certainly would!  GREAT JOB JAN!!!!!!!!!!!

Thanks,
Roger Smith"
Great!
It has good games and quite a few of them.  the face maker is pretty cool and is fun to use.
"Avast antivirus professional had outstanding performance in the last 3 years I have used it.

I shall continue to use Avast pro antivirus."
"I purchased this software for use with my MAP330.
I've used the trusty MAP330 from Arizona to Alaska to Florida and it's been a great traveling companion.
I have a vacation planned to the Caribbean, so I thought I'd load it up with some maps of the area.

Initially the WWBM software wouldn't load on my XP machine, and gave ERROR-15 Can't Load Drivers.  I finally shut down every other running program including my anti-virus and it finally got past the error.  Fair enough...the instructions do say to close all programs.
Next the program couldn't find the CD even though it was in the drive.  I rebooted, and the software now sees the CD and comes up.  The first thing it says is that I need version 4 of the firmware in my GPS.
I have version 2.
Ok, so I go to the Magellan site, and look under their support section for discontinued models...and there were no updates available.  Nice.
I finally ended up at the yahoo M330 group (those folks are great!) and found advise and files to upgrade to version 4.
So I plugged in my newly updated GPS and fired up the program.  It came up and detected my M330, so right away I zoomed my windows screen in on the island of St. Maarten and found myself staring at a beige outline of the island with absolutely NO detail.
No roads.  No cities.  No topo info.

Just so I'd at least have an outline of the island in the GPS, I ran the upload process.  It immediately failed and told me I have an incorrect version of the software.
I gave up at this point.
I'm very annoyed with Magellan for creating this sub standard un-friendly product.  In spite of the very dependable M330 unit, I think I will look to a company with better software support for the next GPS."
"This program will run in OS X, but that's about it.  We had all kinds of problems.  Not able to save, can't print, won't insert graphics and on and on.
It could have been a good program if they just converted it for OS X, but we're sending it back."

"This is the first MAC software that even comes close to the Windows ""Scrapbook Factory Deluxe"" software that I have loved for years.  The only thing that's missing is the ""graphic text"" option.

"Let me sum up this software ""total junk""

Pinnacle will give you one free support phone call for help, then $25 for the next call.

They give you free email support, but answer everything but your problem.  They try and blame it on Windows XP, and will have you reload Windows.

I owned Studio 8, and it worked fine.  Went to Studio 9, and had a few problems.  Upgraded to Studio 9 Plus, and after a week of trying to make it render my projects with no sucess, and crash after crash, I removed it from my machine.

They sent me an offer of their all new 10.5 plus upgrade, Hollywood FX, 3 of their Premium packs, and a hat that says Studio 10 on it.  This said that the program had been rebuilt from bottom up.  This program should be called ""Crash after Crash"", and the only thing that works is the hat.

If you feel the urge to waste $100, and hours of your time, just buy this product.

Look at the reviews on Studio 10, and the other Studio products, and most only have one star.  Out of over 100 reviews over 95% had one star.  I found one with 5 stars, but looking at the reviewers other reviews he is obviously an employee, or share holder in the company.  He wrote a 1 star review on a Sony competative product, and 5 star reviews for other Pinnacle products that you would not own if 10.5 worked."
"After over 20 years of virtually trouble-free Quicken use, my last couple of upgrades and overall performance have not gone so well.  Together, with all of the negative reviews I have seen, I had put off the 2016 upgrade as long as I could.  Then, with Windows 10, I made the plunge and I couldn't be more pleased with Quicken 2016.  First the conversion from Quicken 2014 was flawless and I am once again really enjoying all that Quicken can do.

Thanks to the whole Quicken Team for your hard work.  Quicken is BACK!!!"
never worked.  hate.
"I got excited when I found a AV suite that had a nice price and many had rated Bitdefender products high. However, I personally installed it on three Vista computers and had major OS errors after installing. On one laptop which my wife uses the email program WinMail from Microsoft the program crashed all the time and Bitdefender acknolledge the error with it's own screen requesting to send a error report (thank's for nothing).
Then it makes another attempt to launch the program! Of course another crash! I am a very savy computer user's and have not had this much trouble with software for some time. Beware! is all I can say."
I was never told that I was getting a 2012 version rather than a 2014 version. I had to send it back for the 2014 version!

"Traditionally, I shy away from giving a 1-star review. It's very primitive; you aren't fully satisfied, so you throw a 1-star review on to cause a stink.

I am a (reasonably) tech-savvy guy in my mid 20s. I saw that Windows 8 was going to be...how do I say it...unique? But it touted that it was going to be ""built on Windows 7"" (hence the ""upgrade""), and very stable. I adopted this myself, and told all my nay-sayer friends that they should get on board as well.

It booted up very fast, at first. Then, over time & for no reason, it got a little slower. Maybe added 8 seconds. Did I mention I had a SSD? So it was like going back to a HDD-boot. Annoying, but okay. The layout is very different & I didn't like it much at all, but I decided to stick with Windows 8.

...until my PC downloaded an update for Windows 8, that is. I paid no attention to what it was; I just saw my system was downloading an official Windows 8 update & it would install when I shut down my PC. Typical, right? So I shut it down, it starts to install. It reboots, continues the install. Then it hangs. I know better to interrupt updates, so I let it hang. For hours. Then, when I finally killed/interrupted it by shutting down & restarted, it wouldn't boot into the OS. I tried everything! It was dead, and I'm still recovering from it.

TL;DR? I don't blame you. Bottom line: An official Windows 8 update killed my laptop! Also, the layout is just flat-out weird. This OS is truly deserving of a 1-star review; I am going back to Windows 7 Pro 64-bit to STAY."
It allowed me to finish my returns in one setting. My CPA used to charge me $250 for the same service.
Love it!!
This software brought to life many of the features of my computer that could not be utilized under XP. This did require updating the motherboard bios and chip firmware to the latest version which was easy enough to do. Overall the computer behaves much better under Win7 and I like many of the features Win7 has to offer.
"I have an older version of Hallmark and I loved it.  I got a new computer and needed the newer version and decided to go back with Hallmark.  I love it.  Very easy to use, very user friendly.  Definitely recommend this if you enjoy doing your own personalized cards.!!"
"Many of the useful and practical functions from the previous version are gone.  Rather than help streamline the work to save time, this ""new and improved"" version complicates things unnecessarily."
"For my home use, the alternative is a disgusting, irritating program. WordPerfect is much better, easier to use, does what I need. Most word processors have become overgrown, complex, complicated and useless. This one is still usable, but is not quite as friendly as its earlier versions. Still more useful than its main alternative."
Great place to park all my music. It is accessible to all my devices. I enjoy all the Prime music  I can add to my play lists.
I use it for all my occasion cards. Pretty easy to figure out.

"Have used H & R Block since 2007.  NEVER had an issue before at all. I downloaded this and it WILL NOT import my 2014 taxes! I called, was on hold for 40 min and I was hung up on by the tech.  Same second time and the chat disconnected.  I was totally polite each time which makes me conclude that they have no idea how to fix this issue. My 2014 and all others are on my desk top. My 2014 does not have a ""restore"" feature on it for me to try that as others have.  Not sure what to do now except for hand enter my return which has a huge business return so that will be no fun.  I did work for H & R Block as a tax preparer for three years so luckily I can do this crap on my own anyways but I feel like I totally just wasted $60 bucks. Turbo tax does address this issue and they have downloaded a fix so I may just switch to them."

Does add features that support price to upgrade from older version.

"Long time quicken user. Since the early 90's, I believe.

Read all the reviews. Was nervous about buying this version, but I did.

Quicken H&B 2009 previously installed on a Win 7 64 bit machine. Installed Quicken H&B 2012. Let's see: Zero. Problems.

Everything works. A little quicker, too, than the previous version. If I have any problems, I'll come back and update.

I'm not a MAC zealot but that is one thing I could always count on.  I cant believe Intuit would put out a product like this and Amazon wouldn't absolutely plaster that all over the item.  Very pissed off on this one."
This is a DEMO only. Not the full software! Very disappointing as it was a gift for my son.
"Snow Leopard isn't really a lot. I'm not really sure what you would really expect, but it's a good upgrade. I mean come on. It's less than 30 bucks. Most features you find inadvertently, and they're always a nice surprise. I've had a few (albeit small) compatibility issues with some Adobe plug-ins, but everything was fixable.

It's not a necessary upgrade, but will pave the way for future apps, and it has a few really nice features."
"Not all was intuitive, but from what I read about the recent changes with Turbo Tax, I'm glad I bought this.  Seamlessly integrated previous years of Turbo Tax prep into the program, and finished my taxes for the year at half the cost."
I sent it back!  It would not play on my computer as advertised.  The 32 bit doesn't work on a 64 bit computer!!
I have been using Quicken 2008 and this is a totally worthless upgrade. The only reason I purchased this was because I was forced to so that I could download my banking information. I'm very disappointed in the new version. They have made it harder to use and removed some functions altogether. If you don't download transitions from your bank then don't bother with this.
"I got this product when I had to move to a newer computer because TurboTax would no longer work on my old iMac. In the process of getting the newer computer, my Quicken 2006 would not migrate to the new computer, and since reviews of Quicken 2007 were not too swift, I decided to move to iBank. My old Quicken files migrated quite well to iBank and after a small learning curve I settled in and found iBank to be a good replacement. Some of the ""self-created"" reports aren't quite as good, in my opinion, as I had been able to do with the old Quicken, but I have hopes that is just part of my learning curve."
"With Print Shop Pro Publisher, I've been able to create great projects, and not only personal creations.  Is a very versatile software, because I'm able to use it at home and at work too, due to a big selection of templates for office forms, and graphics, that allows anyone to make amazing presentations."
"I have been using GoBack for years starting with Adaptec, Roxio, and now Norton version 4.0 and never had a problem.

I bought Windows XP Pro and the stand alone version of GoBack at the same time and installed them on a new hard drive. This works just as it did in the past with no problems. Just like the versions that came before it GoBack has saved my rear end many times over the years.

I have never used it in the internet package that may have been the trouble the other people have had with it, but I would recommend GoBack to anyone using it as I did"
"everything was very good, keep doing that way and you will get it, I would like to give you a 100 points... good job..."
It's not very easy to understand. If I get more time to dig into it I suppose it may get easier like friends of mine say it is.
"It may be a fine program, but I couldn't get it to download on my Mac with several different strategies. I much prefer Mavis Beacon. Thanks fam"
works but  it updates demands upgrade and I  have only had it a month
It helped being able to research this product before purchasing from the infro you provided and seeing the video. It was easy to install and just as easy to use with all the help provided with the software and online.
love the product hated that it did not work with my computer!
Still trying to learn something ..
I love Norton. Never have anything else.
"I love my mac but, I am so use to office it was really nice to have an office suite for my mac!"
I bought this for my son who loved playing it in school.  Wouldn't work at all on my Windows 7 computer and doesn't always work correctly on our old computer that uses Windows XP.  I only recommend using it on old dinosaur computers.
"I just purchased this software and am going to use it to clear all this paper food recipe clutter. Since I was on the DVO website, looking at how to create a cookbook seems easy enough to work with and to read. Also, I have herbal and beauty recipes that I would like to incorporate in this software to keep them organized as well. It seems that one could create another library as well as the Cookbook Library within the bookshelf. If not, I will just use the cookbook Library to organize the herbal and beauty recipes for now. I have to put a rating on this now to get it to publish and when I get the software and begin using it, then I will go back in and change the rating accordingly."
"These are very useful plugins with very intuitive interface priced lower than the competitive products (+ they sell them for 30-40% off every couple of months). Multi platform NIK bundle (MAc/Win and Lightroom/Photosop in the same package) goes now for 150.

All-in-one bundle (different modules though), you are set up for almost any challenging shot. Saves a lot of time on editing compared doing it manually in Photoshop. Allows multiple consequtive filters withing the same module.

The only con is that on 6-core AMD processor +8RAM the application of ONE filter to RAW image processed in LR or PS takes ~1 minute. NIK generates previews for ALL filters in less than 1 min and after that the final image w/o a visible lag. Try both before making decision to buy!

I wish they had all modules ""under the same roof"" so you could layer on in the Photoshop w/o going in and out every time. They have Topaz FXlab as a Photoshop module that allows to layer Topaz all plugins but not with other party plugins (NIK etc.

Well worth the money"
"After reading the mixed reviews, I was somewhat tentative about how much value this was going to be  I just got back from 2 weeks in Sicily - and they don't speak much English there.  This map set was absolutely critical to my driving around Sicily.  I plugged this into my Nuvi 1450.  I did not want to take a chance trying to learn a new system in a rental car in Italy.  The navigation was excellent but you should always carry a map as well since there are many alternative routes.  I used the Michlin Sicilia 365 map(also bought on Amazon and very good).  This unit tried to take me the coastal route since I was on the coast but I wanted to go inland to the much faster Toll road so I forced it to reroute me there.  Also, Sicily changes their one way streets often according to the locals and the Garmin does not track all the changes so be on the look out if it tries to direct you down the wrong way on a one way street and go on until it reroutes you.  Over all, my driving in Sicily would have been an absolute nightmare without this Garmin map!  It saved me a lot of grief."
"This did not come with a CD.  I was told to go from XP to Windows 8 it should be a CD.  This was a download and then many, and I mean many checks for updates for 8 before I could get the update for 8.1.  I spent two days working on this and I'm still trying to get my computer back to the way it was before.  I really loath MicroSoft, but this was so much cheaper than buying a new computer."
never able to down load  no help from avg  they were stupid could not understand simple problem  will never use thier products again  every time you send them an email  yuo get a different person  it is still in box  im mad about it will just throw it garbage  when i need new protection  it will not be avg
"Purchased Webroot after getting a very agressive virus on my machine last year. At the time of the virus attack, I was using an up to date Norton product, which still allowed the virus. Ended up having to take my pc to a shop, and they recommended purchasing Webroot. I have been 100% satisfied with this product."
"I got a number, COMP USA LLC, from your site and they charged me $199.99 for (apparently) nothing, and included a charge for AVG anti-virus software, which I have twice been notified is an illegal copy.  The next day I got a different number from your site; the problem was quickly solved at no charge.  The problem was downloading a Kindle book I bought.  I am disputing the charge through my credit card holder"
As stated.  Received very quick. Thank
"Fun to use.  There is a learning curve for the beginner, but once you get into it it is fun."
"Of course, Excel is a lovely product, though whether you need the upgrade is highly questionable. I found this pretty much just MS trying to create a need they can charge for. Especially since you can open and create Excel spreadsheets for free without actually buying Excel... or order StarOffice 6.0 here on Amazon.
Excel 2002 is fine, but like a $6000 umbrella stand for your dog, not a lot of people actually need it."
"To my surprise WPS Office work just fine, easy to install and works just great. Thank you.."
"Works great on the older model PC programs, I bought it for my need Lenova yoga but the programming is too new and I could not install it. Unfortunately the new version creator 12 is not compatible and in my opinion does not work nearly as good at the version 9. I would recommend this version 9 but stay away from version 12"
"I won't repeat the details above. Only that it boots up fast, very fast and if you don't like the tile interface you can put a desktop tile in the default upper left position and just hit enter and be gone with the metro look. Yes, there is a utility on the net too but it isn't too annoying to just hit enter.
one thing - as this is an ""upgrade"" if you wish to do a complete fresh install of this product it will not accept your license key unless you do the following which I found using the google. this still works as of 3/24/2013 but you should research to make sure it is still up-to-date.
1. Run the registry editor (regedit)
2. Find the following key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup\OOBE
3. Change the value for 'MediaBootInstall' from 1 to 0
4. Open an elevated command prompt (run as admin)
5. Run the following command: slmgr -rearm
6. Reboot"
"Be very careful to somehow determine if this ""Pro"" package will work on your computer.  It does NOT function on my Windows 7 dual-core system.  Everything else on the planet is OK, but not Corel.
After hours of trying to load it (from disc over and over again), I went through the arduous process of contacting ""customer service"".  They fuss up about contact and want money to subscribe!  Anyway, Service couldn't help, so it's been referred to Engineering, which I've been advised ""can take a long time"".
Unless you know it will run, don't buy it.  It will run for maybe 15 seconds, then STOP with no remedy."
"After I purchased a 7 disc to fix that machine, i picked up vista to resurrect an old machine, worked great for the price and now I can fix it in the future if it breaks again."
Easy to use. And saves you a lot of money.
"I was really frustrated at first and thought I'd downloaded a lemon, but it turns out my brand-new Mac-compatible USB headset wouldn't play nice with the program. Now that I've switched to a different headset, the program works almost flawlessly. I've been a longtime user of Dragon Naturally Speaking on PC, and used version 11.5, I believe. Once I finally installed the necessary patch for Yosemite and found a mic that works, the accuracy and speed of this program far surpasses my previous experience with Dragon software. Well worth the couple of hours of stressful diagnostics when I first set it up."
"After reviewing product reviews for previous versions of Math Advantage, I purchased a copy of the software. Even though most of the reviews for the older verions of this software are negative, I told myself that they must have worked the bugs out for this version. However, once loaded to my computer I knew better and once again remembered that you can't expect someone else to change. Once I loaded the precalculus/calculus cd into my computer it loaded and created a shortcut as I expected. Then the software prompted me to type in my name, which I did. My name is Brian; however, when I typed B-r-i-a-n the display showed Br5an. I retyped, thinking I had made an error but got the same thing. I tested the other keys by opening a blank Microsoft Word document. I discovered that most of the keyboard was reconfigured. I ran some tests to include a virus scan and a scan for spyware that may have caused the problem. However, everything was in order. I called Encore customer service the next day. Before, I could tell the Encore rep the test results, he quickly told me that my problem could only be caused by a problem with the ribbon cable that connects the keyboard to the motherboard (I have a Sony Vaio laptop) I told the person that I didn't think that was possible since I always handle my laptop with the utmost care. He kept his cousre and told me that he couldn't think of anything else that it would be. Finally he added that he thought it would be a good idea for me to call Sony to begin troubleshooting with them. I called Sony. They told me that I should do a system restore. However, I had never made a back-up so I couldn't go back to a restore point. Next the rep. said that I could do a complete system restore. A complete system restore would wipe the hard drive then rewrite the operating system to it. That would mean losing alot of data such as over 48 hours worth of music, Microsoft Office, Norton Systemworks, and all Microsoft updates to name a few. The Sony rep stated that if the problem disappeared after a complete system restore then the problem was with the software; and if the problem didn't disappear after the restore then the problem was hardware related. I went ahead with the restore, suspecting the whole time that the problem was not hardware related. When the restore finished, I opened a blank Microsoft Word document to test the keyboard. It now worked fine, proving that the software was the problem. The moral is that Encore technical service representatives are poorly trained or are just trained to lie to get the customer off of the phone quicker. As a result, I spent many hours reloading programs and music to my system which would have been fine if I wouldn't have loaded this software. I have since sent the software back to encore with a letter, similiar to this one, requesting a refund. Please don't be a victim. Investigate before you buy."
"It is a bit cheesy at times, but then again, it it loads better than the ones you use in high school.

3 weeks of daily use and I am no longer a hunt-and-peck typer. I am up from 20 words per minute to 65.

Unexpected Pro: can run off CD or install to computer. Also comes with Mac version."
Have not used yet. I heard it was a good product.
"still not happy with the additional fee to e-file the state.  But at least with this TurboTax sold on Amazon, it does have one State included.  I used the software for two different filings and it saved us both a little bit of cash.  Amazon's price was $10 better than found locally.

On another note, I used HR Block's software last year after years of using Turbo Tax.  Don't do it!  HR Block was not good at all and not as complete as Turbo Tax.  I feel like I left some money in the IRS' pocket with HR Block."
"I used this card for several weeks on the Greek mainland as well as on Crete in a Nuvi 1450.  I drove a good portion of the country from Athens south to the coast, west thru the Peloponnesian and then north to Thessaloniki.  I do not know how I would have got thru the trip without this setup.  Even with a smartphone much of the countryside has no data access so you really need an offline solution.  There is however a major caveat as the Garmin assigns 54mph as the default on all roads that have no speed limit info.  Most of these roads in Greece are not safe to drive faster than 35mph and usually less.  Therefore if you are set for fastest route, you will almost always end up on a really sketchy road.  This might be fun to explore but can be a bit harrowing and it will take WAY longer to get to your destination.  Best to check the route out online ahead of time and put some via points along a major highway to force the route.  Also since there are at least 4 ways to spell everything in Greece you can save some frustration by looking up things on Google maps ahead of time and using the latitude/longitude for entering destinations.

Garmin should really re-examine it's default assignment of speeds to avoid major routing errors."
"Simple, Affordable"
Nice to have it on Disc
"This is Microsoft's attempt to get more money out of you. If you actually use your computer for work, this is slow and painful to use. If you want to use your computer like an Android tablet, then this is for you. Oh, but wait, you don't have a touchscreen monitor, do you? You can buy Start8 and get a start button back. And CNET hsa an article on getting back most of the features of Windows 7."
I have to get use to it.
Yes easy to install and works well
"What a disappointment! For years I used & liked v11! It is so simple & easy! Now I bought a new computer, of course windows 10, so I bought the 4.0....it is so complicated, almost unusable, things that were done in one click now take several & nothing about the new one is as easy as the old version.......I hope to return the one I bought & look for something simpler to use. I think the nerds did another ""update"" they always make things more complicated, just look at windows!"
I like the pro better
"I really do hope i get my money back because licensees don't work. I tried reinstalling many times. Buyers beware, do not buy this product.

They seem to have fixed the licensing issue. You may now buy this product with confidence."
I just put this on my computer having purchased it about a month ago from Amazon. The first thing I am told is that Nolo is no longer updating this version. Upon printing out a Minor's Medical Treatment release I am given two pages of legalize saying this may be out of date but I can upgrade at a significant discount by calling them. As this is just the middle of 2011 maybe they should have called it Willmaker for the first half of 2011. May be a good program but you'll never know because all they will give you is a disclamer and ask you to upgrade at more cost. You can't bypass the two page disclaimer because it prints them out of order if you try to not print them.
"Immediate response to purchase product, but unable to get customer support when product won't download properly.  Over an hour wasted on hold listening to elevator music."
The product was as advertised and delivered on time.
Good
"Compare with LibreOffice and save yourself some money.

Corel WordPerfect Office is horrendously and hopelessly outdated. If you want to see for yourself, then find some complex Microsoft Office documents and open them up in WordPerfect X7 and LibreOffice 4.3 side-by-side and see for yourself.

LibreOffice is open source software, always free of charge, and has components comparable to the full edition of Microsoft Office.

Corel WordPerfect Office looks and feels like a program from the 1990s. It won't outright mutilate Microsoft formats, but it does not display them as the author intended them to look. LibreOffice does a much better job.

You don't have to spend any money to see the difference. Just install the free trial of Corel WordPerfect Office X7 from their site and observe the difference. The free trial is good for 30 days, but after you compare it to LibreOffice, that's 29.99 days more than you'll need.

There was a time when WordPerfect was about the best you were going to do outside of Microsoft's office suite, but those days ended, probably 10 years ago. Corel was having all kinds of financial problems in the early 00s, so they took a bunch of Microsoft money in exchange for dropping Corel Linux and their WordPerfect Office port to Linux, and ending their work on Wine. Fortunately, in the long run, it didn't matter. Linux is alive and well and I can't see anything that Linux users are missing from Corel's current line up of software.

All that's really left of the WordPerfect Office suite is a clunky eyesore that someone has patched up well enough to kind of/sort of keep working."
"this is a very useful tool. i can't say howmany times i have used this in my rearch. it has both the english and hebrew / aramaic translations of the texts, with acceptions for the rashi commentartys and portions of the zohar which are also lacking in the printed editions. the only other thing that i feel this product was lacking was, a gamatria calculator which apparently comes with the bar illan software."
"The product promises on the home site that performance is better . CNet Ranks it high . But, the product is so bad when attempting to download from amazon it has the nerve to produce an error message saying check what bit system you are using in other words would insinuate it won`t run on both 32/ 64 bit systems same time . I was lucky I got Amazon to give refund . Otherwise regardless of refund or not , it would not work , in other words if you have too choose between 64 / 32 bit system THE product shouldn`t be labeled 2015 It would be labeled 1999 and would have time travel mastered !"
great tool
Could not download it. Too bad as I paid for it and could not enjoy it or get credit for it!!
"This item I ordered and received seems to be a newer version of itself since the main characters have British accents, which they don't in other games they are from, or even in the demo of this game. With Luther the small green fish having a British accent, I don't recognize his voice."
Good deal and have it installed in several devices
"This is good for people who like to build Legos, but don't have the pieces, but has some significant downsides.  The creation inevitably takes long and is fairly complex.  It's difficult to get a good view of your creations with the tools provided.  It's slow and choppy for outdated computers (mine's 200 megahertz).  On the plus side, this is realistic (compared to actually making a lego creation) and has some neat fun things (like dynamite).  Ultimately, I only recommend this for people who like to build and have a computer with at least 500 megahertz."
I have used this product several times without any problems. This item works as expected. I am very pleased with purchase.
"scans real too fast put Norton back on my desktop after about 2 months of using Webroot, Norton found like 12 cookies and 1 trojan (virus?)"
"Didn't think I would be able to find this product, but was pleased to. Product does everything Mom wants it to."
Works great
"If you're planning on using Home and Business 2013 for a small office, you should consider finding something else. Managing multiple license keys under one account seems to be impossible. I think their new setup might work if you're a student purchasing this for yourself, and you only have one Live account and one key to manage. But if you're a student, why would you be spending money on this anyways when you can use something like Libreoffice? If you're trying to purchase numerous keys for multiple employees, you're going to drive yourself crazy going this route. The only way to deal with MS for a business solution is to go with a volume license for about twice as much money. Or, worse, do office 365!

Aside from the abysmal licensing and horrible integration with the MS cloud, the product itself just stinks. The UI is some sort of high-contrast theme that I would assume is for the visually impaired. I haven't found a way to change it however. There is also an issue with things not loading correctly the first time. Once everything is in memory, however, everything at least works the second time around. To be honest, I've had this installed for several weeks and I find myself using Libreoffice instead.

I would avoid this product like the plague."
"I've been a user of Passage Express for a couple of years and just love it.  It allows you to package genealogy information into a format that can be enjoyed by the entire family.  It does not create data - you need to have the photos, movies, stories and family tree information - but the hard part has always been to find a way to package all that data collected by the person in the family who is the history-nut (that's me in our family) into a format that our children and grand children can understand and enjoy.  This helps organize and present data; it produces either a CD, DVD or Flash Drive that can be run on any Windows computer (no version available for the Mac).  I've used on all Windows platforms up through Windows 8, and it works just great."
"First of all, it's not worth worth the money. Don't get me wrong, it's a ""good product,"" that is of you know how to use it.
1. The animations are really awkward, if you've never done animation DO NOT GET THIS!
2. It's difficult to create about a 1 minute animation without having to watch about every tutorial there is.
3. IT WON'T LET YOU UPLOAD TO YOUTUBE, after you make a video, there's like 5 ways to convert it. None of them you can upload to YouTube with. You will have to download a video converter, which none of them are free.

Like I said, it's not worth your money if you're new, or trying animation out. You would have a better chance at stop-motion."
"worked fine for a while, then out of nowhere it won't work, click on icon and says doesnt exist. uninstalled, says doesnt exist, reinstalled, workes for that day without any of my previous history, next day doesnt exist again."
"I installed it last February 1st.
Been working really good this year. Installed properly on 3 computers too.
There is a few good free one's. But this is a good product as even google searchs tell you if a site is Norton safe.
You can run it any time but does so on it's own each night at sometime in background if your using it.
I recommend it to anyone."
Quicken allows me to view my spending in graphs and reports.  I love the fact that I can make a budget. Great product for personal expenses.
"I had the old Quicken ""Family Lawyer"" software and really liked it; but, it's old software and is not compatible with Windows 10 on the new computer.  I bought Quicken ""Legal Business Pro"" thinking it would be similar; but, sadly, it is not.  For example, you can no longer export the text so you can add custom language or even tighten up the programs default formatting (makes what could be a one page document into three), it won't even allow you to cut and paste text into a document of your own.  Also gone are things like having an amortization schedule generated for a promissory note.  I'm disappointed that Quicken has, over time, taken away features while doubling the price.  It may meet some users needs; but, not mine."
"AVG is best known for their free antivirus though they have offered for years a full security suite. I had never bothered to try AVG Internet Security (AVG IS), mainly because it is an expensive package in comparison to most of the other offerings on the market. That said, it is a solid product and worth consideration in spite of the cost.

I should start by stating, for the record, that I had a dreadful install experience. AVG IS partially installed itself and then errored out. After a reboot, AVG IS was alive but outdated, and what was broken was the ability to update. Worse, the uninstall was also broken. After getting the uninstall ironed out, I tried to install again and this time everything was much smoother.

AVG IS is organized and clean with a very clear and easy-to-understand overview dashboard. At a glance you can tell what is active and what is not active. Double-clicking on any of the icons in this view gives access to adjustment controls by which the component in question can be manipulated and set as desired. I like this particular view. One thing that is not clear, though, is that to get to the real nuts and bolts of the various components' configurations, one must use the pull-down menus, not the icons.

AVG's firewall appears to do a good job of hiding the system on the net, locking down service ports and cutting off ping responses. I was unable to break it. However, where it gets interesting is in the control afforded the user - individual applications can be locked down, policies set for different networks, and so much more. Other firewalls do this, but AVG's organization in the interface is better than average.

AVG's track record as an antivirus vendor is well known. However, with versions prior to 9.0 their antivirus was slow, intrusive and hard to interrupt. AVG seems to have gotten the idea of how to improve this - it took about 90 minutes to scan over 1,000,000 items if you include the registry and even running at full speed I hardly noticed except for the fact that I had the task manager open and saw an occasional spike in CPU activity. I launched several applications, typed a lot, and even searched for a file on the hard drive and saw no real impact on the system. Cycles consumed seemed to be consistently under 10%.

AVG throws a lot of other things into the mix that you'd expect in a decent suite - antispam, antispyware, rootkit detection, and several other components. What surprised me was to find a process viewer that has the ability to kill processes, accessible from the dashboard under system tools. I have never worked with a security suite with that built-in as part of the package. Included is a connectivity viewer and even a startup process viewer, with the ability to manipulate the entries within. That's a very nice plus.

I've been unable to work with the antispam up to this point, as I get no spam. Even so, there are many, many settings that can be adjusted to the antispam, such as adding a blacklist server such as spamcop to assist with checking, Bayesian training and a lot more. Based on the feature set I suspect this antispam is very effective.

AVG IS includes a McAfee-style system of evaluating returns from search engines, marking unsafe links in the results window. It is not as thorough as McAfee's Site Adviser, but it is effective in giving you  heads-up when there is a possible danger ahead.

There are two things that AVG does not have that I wish were present. First, there is no parental control module. It looks like AVG made no effort at all to include a parental controls module, and while that's ok it is something that most other security suites include.  I was unable to even find a manual block list - if it's there, I cannot find it. Second, I found no ability to see the presence of other computers on the network. It is not something that I have found in a lot of suites but it's a very nice-to-have.

AVG has put together a very nice internet security suite. The main components, the antivirus and the firewall, are both very effective and all of the other components seem to be working nicely. There is room for some improvement/expansion, as is true with most security suites, but what is here is very polished and clean. AVG is a little pricey when compared to most other suites, but in spite of that cost it is very much worth consideration when looking at computer security suites. I am comfortable giving AVG IS a 5/5 stars rating - it isn't absolutely perfect, but what is there is excellent."
"This is a good product and I use it often.  I generally use Picassa for the quick and easy edits but I like some of the tools in Photo Pro X2 more.  One thing, however, is that there is no support for RAW files.  This is surprising in a product like this.  This wasn't a problem before but I now have a camera which produces RAW files so I will probably have to get another program like Photoshop Elements to really deal effectively with the RAW files."
I have been using QuickBooks since 1999 and upgraded to QB Premier in 2011.  Last month I upgraded to QB 2014 and I really like the changes in this edition.  It does everything I need it to for my business.  I highly recommend Premier 2014!!
"This is like an OEM version - only one installation and one activation. Forget about installing it on more than one computer like the disc/retail version. Also, forget about moving it to another computer and getting it activated again (legally anyway).

I'd stay away from this unless you are absolutely sure that you will only be installing it and activating it on one computer AND that you will never want to move it to another computer in the future. Otherwise, pay a little more and get the non-PKC version that lets you install it on a desktop and notebook computer and move the license to another computer if you ever need or want to.

For a little more money, the non-PKC version is a much better value for many."
"Work in the background, and keeps the computers safe.  I recived the activation code, entered it an we were up and running."
like the price for 5 PCs- beats paying for each one individually and makes less work for me.  Thanks! Love it.
Excellent price for 10-device coverage.  I like having access to the code and software through Amazon.
"Turbo Tax does a nice job walking you through the filing process.  My only complaint is the e-file limit it places on the customer.  I was limited to five federal e-files, which does not cover all the family members for which I prepare returns.  I am not in the business of preparing tax returns and do not want to purchase the more expensive Turbo Tax package just to cover a few more family members.  I also do not like paying $19.95 to e-file my California tax return.  Next year I will just use the free e-file process offered by IRS and State of California and skip Turbo Tax altogether."
"One of the options in system Mechanic is to defragment system files.  I ran this and it estimated it would run for 30 minutes.  An hour and 45 minutes later I clicked on the cancel button.  My PC has been hanging up ever since.  I am now to the point where I can't boot it up.  System Mechanic, in its zeal for cleanlyness, also deleted the system restore points.  So now I'm dead in the water."
Very very good
"Buyer beware! The following is a quote from Intuit's website regarding their upgrade policy. ""There is no ""upgrade"".  Regardless who is selling it, it is all a complete program. Intuit's price is where it is so that the authorized vendors have an incentive to sell it. It is a rare occasion that Intuit beats Amazon's prices.""

I bought Quicken 2015 and did updates to it but now I'm expected to buy a new version a year later at full price ""regardless who is selling it"" it's a rip off to the consumer!"
The item arrived rather early! Great product!
"bought this when it came out, didn't work as well as i hoped. called in and they told me that it would work much better if I used a dedicated microphone, bought a 100 bucks bluetooth mic. Pairs well with my computer but does not work with drago because you have to also buy their usb adapter. Called customer support, they treat you like you are stupid and that this is an obvious phenomenon, now I have to useless $100 mic and not a great product."
I use this in my first grade classroom. The children love it.  Great graphics and keeps the children interested in what they are doing.
just what I expected
"I have no idea whether this software works for its intended function (backup/restore), but it completely trashed my registry when installing other new software packages! After installing Acronis 11, three processes were added to startup, Acronis Scheduler, Acronis Timounter and Trueimage Monitor. When these processes were running any software installation caused the BSOD on restart and usually was unable to recover from system restore automatically. When these three processes were disabled, subsequent installation of the same software products worked fine.

Stay away from this product!"
"This version does have the old entry scenes like I expected, but it's still not quite the version I was looking for."
Just in short...i love Nero's burning capability and ease of use in burning...but a lot of the stuff that is included isn't what i wanted so i uninstalled most of it.
"The ONLY AV protection that I trust.  Excellent product, key management is VERY nice."
Movies sucked. All the good ones you had to pay  extra for.  I won't renew.
"This is no longer supported by
Suze Orman.
Icalled the number in the information and was told that it is no longer supported or associated with Suze Orman"
Fantastic Software.  Only a few problems that they seem to be working out with new versions as of this posting.
"Another disappointed long time user here. Having waited out the removal of schedule D from Deluxe, I purchased the download product with one State return after their management decision to include it on 2/7/2015. The installation and automatic no cost upgrade to Premier went smoothly.

All was well until It came time to download the one included State tax prep software, at which point I was informed an additional 39.95 would be required.  Calls to Turbotax utilizing their assignment of an incident number and automatic call back procedure is yet to provide any response after six hours and an overnight wait.

UPDATE
Approximately 24 hours after my automated assignment of an incident number, I was called back by a rep. She added the State I needed while still on the phone and computer, at no cost."
"I have no opinion about it, but my wife is happy."
"Like most everyone else, I've had the unpleasant experience of buying things that didn't perform well or that otherwise didn't meet expectations, but I can't say that I recall EVER buying something that not only didn't work, but actually began to self-destruct on first use.  I had the exact same experience as another reviewer stated: ""The vac had poor suction and did not pick up anything, but rather it shot tiny pieces of some sort of white all over my car seats and rugs."" Worst. Product. Ever. It only gets a single star because I can't give it NO stars."
Im glad that i got this early as i thought so i can do my work on time without any worry.
"In 2008 I wanted to migrate all of my stuff from my XP machine to a new Mac Book using an external hard drive formatted for the Mac OS. This program worked great for writing and reading data on that G-tech drive. When my Mac Book arrived all of my files easily loaded on that machine.

In 2009 I bought an HP machine as a backup. It ran Vista. This program did the same thing just as well at reading and writing files to my external drive. I no longer use Microsux products since they gave us that colossal rip-off known as Vista. I haven't bought anything related to Microsux since that year so I can't say if this works well on Windoz 7 or 8.

The company had great customer service back then. I hope they still give good service.

If you want to just have a better experience using computers stop using Windoz or OS X. Switch to GNU/Linux and have an easier time. I loved switching to Macs from Windoz. It was a revelation. I feel GNU/Linux is just as good and even better than OS X in so many ways. Think about it. No More Spyware from Apple or Microsux. NSA Free too."
"High quality videos and yet easy to use. Yet it has so much, the more you learn, the more special effects, and PROFESSIONAL videos you can produce. Amazing program and yet extremely cheap for what it does!"
"Easy buy came right away, easy install doesn't operate like Quicken deluxe completely different. It's hard to get the grasp of.  I like simple and this is not. Just my opinion"
Excellent
"Works flawlessly!!  I read on a 2nd gen Kindle, an Asus Tablet & my S5, but the PC version runs much faster.  I have more than a 1000 books in my library, and Kindle for PC can find and download them almost instantly."
"Hi,
I bought this software because I am taking a trip to England soon.

The software is ok, but it could be better, I am not a fan of the zoom.  You have to go up to a zoom bar to adjust.  I also own Delorme Street Atlas and I fing that software much easier to use from a functionality standpoint.  To Zoom in the Delorme you drag a box, or stairstep out. (I know that isn't clear, but once you do it it's easy)

However the price on the Autoroute is what sold me.  I will be using it for about one week, and will probably never use it again.  The fact it sets up with a GPS is very cool, I am a fan of using a laptop as a GPS device, I will never get a pocket size one."
"This DVD lacks the ability to pause, fast forward, and rewind. So, it is impossible to keep up with a lesson and try things yourself at the same time. Also, some of the lessons don't even have a demonstration, so you are staring at a blank page with no examples, while complex ideas are explained.

I would recommend finding another DVD or get a book."
Doesn't print out all the imformation that is needed to share wih family members as I expected it to do.
"This was the manual our teacher told us to buy.  I assume it will be ok, but will let you know if there is a problem"
"I am still using the 1993 version. I used it with my first grandchild. I am still using it with my 5th, who is in 4th grade. They have all enjoyed the interaction, the games which are still in sync with their classrooms. They appreciate the instant feedback and the extra bonus points when they hit 100%. Would someone please update this for newer systems and older grades. I have also used this in teaching situations for remediating students who are far behind."
"Three stars are not given based on the editor and compiler itself but as a result ot thier lack of any English help file (PureBasic.chm) that would normally be accessible with the F1 key.  It comes with a German help file. French, Russian, and others are available.  English written (printable) documentation is available but such media is not searchable and greatly hinders familiarization of new syntax and editing code.
This version was released in 2003 but still functions under Windows 10."
"Easy to use, tons of lovely graphics included."
"This was a great buy for the price...  Everything loaded up perfectly, the product is what was advertized and it was delivered earlier then promised."
It's OK.
WAIST OF MONEY
"Worked very well, don't know if it was my college or cengage that I had trouble opening the book sometimes"
"1. I did not know this was the old version when I purchased the software.
2. I made my purchase in September 2007. The software key was previously registered on April 30, 2007 so I could not register the subscription and it expires in April 2008, not September.
3. I requested that the product be replaced with an unregistered product, which did not happen. Amazon did give me a full refund for the product."
"Not sure about this item, seal was broken and no COA.
I bought this product at $158.99 and I got billed 163.88 for it ?? not sure why,
but I'm not going to deal with it for $5, not worth the headache."
"I need Outlook so as to synchronize *anything* on my cell phone with my computer.  Microsoft ActiveSync requires it.  I mostly use ActiveSync to transfer files, so this is frustrating.  But I know of no alternative.

It's important for me to synchronize my contacts, so I understand buying Outlook for that.  But I'd like to buy it separately, not bundled with editors and spreadsheets that work just as well separately.  Indeed, I never use Outlook for e-mail, because I still use Usenet newsgroups and Outlook doesn't."
"I had several issues with the Spyder2 at first: for one, the 64-bit driver is unsigned and will not install on Windows 7 unless you hit F8 at startup and disable driver signature verification (every time you plug the Spyder in). Since Windows 7 is still in beta, this is forgivable. I wonder if the driver signature works in 64-bit Vista, which also has this requirement? Maybe it just needs to be updated for Windows 7. Anyway...

Beyond the driver issues, the software setup went relatively smoothly. With the software installed, I attempted to calibrate the display, using the preset 6500K setting on the display. The process took about 5 minutes and was essentially automatic. However, the results of this calibration were not at all satisfactory - the grays went from having a slight blue cast to having a severe red cast, and I almost decided to return the Spyder right then and there. However, I decided to calibrate again using the RGB sliders, and wow! I had no idea just how off the display's default colors were!

I saved the profile and all seemed well, so I exited the software.

As soon as I exited, the color reverted back to that ugly red cast that was seen on the first calibration. Despite dissociating the profile from the device in color settings prior to running the second calibration, the file was still locked after the software exited the first time and apparently was not overwritten by the second calibration. It would have been nice if the software had warned about this and prompted for another profile filename instead of silently continuing.

So I calibrated a third time using the RGB sliders, saved the profile under a different name, and now my display's color is nothing short of excellent.

If you can get it to behave, it really is an effective device."
Worked as expected.
"I had a tough time figuring out how to get it activated and transfer data, but once I figured it out....I love it."
"I have had no security issues with this product.  I like the way it works in the background, but I particularly like it shows blocking on the toolbar of Firefox.  So far, I have absolutely no complaints and would recommend it."
"This is the worst. Software as a subsription model is just keyword for criminal activity in adobe's case.  They make it IMPOSSIBLE for you to cancel your subscription, and then when you call support they hang up on you and tell you that you have to wait until the last day of service. Okay, so I have precisely one day to cancel the subscription so I won't be charged for another year? Great! Fantastic! Really makes me furious because they force me to keep their subscription rather than having the freedom to cancel when I want."
Works well
"OK, maybe it was me, maybe it just doesn't work well with windows 98 but, I couldn't get any help from the company that I bought it from or the company that made it.  The web site that they sent me to didn't exist. It never did work for me."
"Program never worked as intended, there's no product support. Company doesn't know what an activation key is, instead gives you a serial number that does not work in the program. I will never buy anything from them again and even though it's been two years I want my money back."
"But, it worked as promised. No problems using the key we received once we got it."
As always a Windows product works better than anticipated. It is almost like it thinks for you almost a little scary
I used this program years ago and found it really helpful. I tried other methods to manage my money. But now I am back because it is the most user friendly method to keep everything organized.
"The first couple of weeks on this program I picked up a vocabulary of over 130 words. I can pronounce the words, recognize them in print, and recognize them when spoken. I needed a Italian program because in the summer  of 2001 I am flying Italy to meet 17 cousins, 7 aunts and 8 uncles for the  first time since I was less than a year old. Only a few of the cousins  speak English, so I need to have some background in Italian too!
I  purchased this program because it was inexpensive and gave me 4 different  CD's for my money. The CD's include: * Talk Now! which is basic vocabulary  * World Talk Italian which is mainly sentence structure * Italian English  Dictionary * Voyage to Italy Tour
I liked this program because it is  basic and gave me a good foundation of words in Italian.  The Talk Now! CD  is broken into 9 major divisions: First Words, Foods, Colors, Phrases, Body  Parts, Numbers, Time, Shopping, and Countries for a total of 275  words.
Each of the divisions have 5 subdivisions: Print the Dictionary  for that division, Play a Easy Game, Play a Hard Game, Practice Speaking,  and Learning the New Words.
In addition there are also 2 other games for  each division set up like concentration game in the main window (check out  the card dealer!) and certificates can be printed for the completion of  this CD. Several different people can use the same CD...just log on to  retrieve your file.
The 2nd CD is much more involved. I have just begun  this CD and one of the activities involves hearing a sentence read aloud.  Then you are presented with 5 strips with phrases on them. Only 4 strips  contain the phrases of the sentence you heard. You must put the strips in  order. IT is tough because the sentences are spoken at a conversational  rate - not slowed down!
The dictionary CD is GREAT!
The tour of Italy  CD is really pretty and interesting.
For my money I am very, very pleased  with my purchase. My only suggestion to you, is to use  headphones while  using this CD. You will be surprised at how much more you retain when all  those background noises are removed! ENJOY!"
"As a previous review stated, the product stops teaching one keys after E and I.  Apparently it was never tested by anyone at the beginner level.

There is no easy way to report this to the publisher as well.

Very disappointing."
"I have a 2-in-1 Asus Transformer and wanted a Kindle without having to loose Windows 8.1 (Excel & Word).  Kindle for PC is the most fantastic software I could have asked for!!!!  I have the best of both worlds and my 17.3 laptop can stay on my desk at home.  No way WALMART, i'm sticking with AMAZON 100%."
"I was a long time user of PaperPort (as it came with my scanner)and upgraded everytime it had an update, hoping it would fix some bug or another,
and of course it didn't. Needed an alternative and found FileCenter online downloaded the trial version and haven't looked back. Great product for a great price."
Won't open on my computer

Literally the best art program I've ever used. The CRISPEST lines I've ever seen! Puts photoshop to shame when it comes to art.
Downloaded for free and my kids really enjoy it
"The software is annoying sometimes- when I click review to see what Ive done, sometimes it won't go question by question any longer, and it returns to the list where I have to select every question individually. However- aside from this minor bug that WONT occur when you're just taking tests, the software is good. It comes highly recommended, the customer service is fantastic, and you see results pretty quickly. Definitely the right choice for PAT practice!"
"Have been using Quicken for Home & Business for years, to track my finances and be able to do planning. I recommend it to anyone who asks."
Great software and really works! I love Google Chrome and use it all the time. It brings everything from my computer to HDTV.
"I purchased the sofware and cable for my LG600.  I passed up the verizon version because Susteen';s supposidly allowed you to edit ringtones and images.  It does not do that very well.  I purchased it so I would not have to reenter 250 contacts into my phone and could back it up incase of phone loss or falure.  We  after almost a year of dealing with Datapilots tech support, on my own I found that if you had Verizon move your contacts from one phone to another, Datapilot will not be able to transfer. the program will crash after just a few entries. I now have to spend another $80 to buy Verizons version and have only contact capability. DO NOT BUY ANY PRODUCT FROM SUSTEEN. THEY DON'T TELL YO EVERYTHING."
"Amazon has seriously messed up here. I have now downloaded this software 3 times, and each time it says it is downloading the 2011 version, but on my computer it installs as the 2010 version. I will have to reorder from TurboTax directly."
LOVE KINDLE
"I had not updated the map on my Garmin Streetpilot 7200 since I purchased it. I was concerned that I would have problems with the update on this older/discontinued unit, especially since the package said Nuvi, although the info said it was compatable.  The update was flawless with no problems. The updated map is definately better; finds sites that I couldn't with the previous map.  If you have this model, I would recommend this map software update."
I bought this for my grandson. I am assuming it was fine. Shipping was fast. Thanks.
Does NOT work with Windows 10.  Can't find any updates.
awesome!!!
Waste of time software is not easy to navigate but can be used. Did better using an internet search of free resume formats. Guess what -- got the job but not using this garbage.
"I switched to H&R last year after the TurboTax fiasco over the schedule D. I haven't looked back. While I like the TT interface better, the business practice of Intuit is enough to keep me here.

"I purchased the Wincleaner OneClick for my newest computer because it started running extremely slow. I remembered I had used WinCleaner on my first 2 computers and I loved it.  So, I purchased the latest version and installed it.  Of course it was easy to install and even easier to use.  After the very first time using it I noticed a big change in my computer.  It was running faster and it made it easier to navigate between websites.  It cleans the files I couldn't do myself and those nasty little attachment that often comes with those ""free downloads"" which are impossible to remove, WinCleaner got them!"
"We have used Norton 360 for the past five years.  A month ago we started experiencing slow downs and freezing on our computer that made it unusable. We tried to run a Norton virus scan, but after we let it run all day while we were at work it simply said ""virus scan  failed"". We defragged our pc, but it could not complete the process because there were 47000+ Norton files that could not be defragged. We called Norton, and after about 15 minutes the tech told us we needed a new computer and transferred me to somebody who put a hard sell on me. When I said I needed to talk to my wife about it, he said, slightly incredulous: ""You need to talk to your wife?"" I guess life is easier for men in India where wives  don't need to be consulted about anything regardless of how it affects them. If  that was supposed to humiliate me into buying their computer, it didn't work. Anyway, I called back and got another tech, who after another fifteen minutes tried to sell me tech support for $200 to fix the virus. My wife and I decided to remove Norton from our computer, even though our contract is not up until September. We installed a free service (avast!), and our computer has been running better than ever. I have tried to find a way to email Norton to ask for a refund, but even under their ""Contact us"" banner there is no email address. This company used to be good.  I guess they have gotten too big. Whatever, beware."
Easy to install and great to run.
I had downloaded this on 2 separate occasions after rebooting my PC...It simply fills my requierments  100%...Easy to use almost completely automatic when downloading music. Adding my own music to the library couldn't be easier....I can't wait to purchase other devices so I can take my cloud wherever I go.
Good product for the price.
"Tune Tools does have a Help file. It is poorly laid out and really in need of a better writer (lots of spelling and formatting errors), but it does sufficiently guide you through the process for porting your music from your iPod to your computer.

My computer crashed a couple months ago and I lost all my iTunes files (close to 3000 songs). I had burned a large portion of my CD collection into iTunes and it was all going to be lost if I couldn't move the music FROM my iPod TO my computer, so that I could continue to synchronize the files as I upload more music and buy more songs via iTunes.

Tune Tools for iPod did the job and it did it quickly and, frankly, more easily than most software I've installed and used.

Some have said that Yamipod is free and that other iPod managers are free - well, that's only partly true. Yamipod will allow you five transfers a day on their freeware - otherwise, for the full release, it's the same 20 bucks you'll spend on Tune Tools for iPod.

Look, it may not be the prettiest interface, but it gets the job done."

All as expected.
"I upgraded from 2010 because I was informed that I would be losing the online transaction download ability and somewhere between that version and 2013, Quicken totally ruined the budget functionality and made it unusable. I hate the new budget and find it totally unworkable. Luckily, I backed up my 2010 data files so I can scrap 2013 and revert to 2010 which I am going to do now. I want to only budget one-year and be able to adjust prior months. The new budget is totally useless. I have used budgeting in Quicken for many years and am very disappointed that the new budget is garbage. Give us back the old system.
I am very angry and dissappointed. I wasted $75 on this piece of trash."
"I am a long time customer of McAfee and have been paying for their product so I can shop and bank online without worrying about viruses, spyware, spam, phishing scams, hackers, and identity theft.  For all these years, I have not had to call upon customer support with any issues until this week.
I started receiving blocked program messages on my computer via my McAfee security protection.  It gave me an option to remove this blocked program, if it was not wanted, or to allow.  I chose to select the remove option, since I was not familiar with the program, but my McAfee security did not remove it.  I continued to receive this message continually throughout the day for two weeks, each time requesting McAfee to remove the unwanted program.
I called McAfee customer service on November 14, 2014, and was told that the blocked program, Artimis! C649BD39C383, was a program and that my subscription does not cover unwanted programs and that I needed to call my Dell customer service for assistance, which I did.  I was informed by the Dell representative that this was a virus, not a program, and that since my computer was out of warranty, I would have to pay a fee of $129.00 for assistance with a three day customer service guarantee.  Since this was a virus, I decided to contact McAfee customer service, again, to request assistance since I have been paying coverage for this.
I called McAfee customer service back on November 18, 2014, and was told that it was a program, not a virus as stated by the Dell representative, and that I needed to pay $69.95 one-time fix, 7 day guarantee, or $179.95 for a year for McAfee TechMaster service representative to assist me.  This call started around 10:00 a.m. and ended around 12:45 p.m.  Through all of this, it was determined through failed attempts to delete this ""unwanted program"" that it was indeed a ""virus/infection"", per McAfee rep. who assisted me.  I was given an account number for this payment and an order number. I was then informed that this was a new virus and had not been detected by the McAfee security.  The data collected from my call will be used to provide protection from this virus through future updates to McAfee security.  I requested from the rep. that since this was a virus, that I would like the $69.95 credited back to my credit card.  However, he informed me that my McAfee Security subscription does not cover new viruses that had not been detected or known about by McAfee; nor however, does it include assisting a McAfee subscription holder.
So, I pay $69.99 a year for McAfee protection surfing the web but McAfee does not provide support when its program fails to stop a new virus, then charges that customer again to fix the problem and learn about the virus so it can provide protection to their other subscription holders that happened to not get the computer virus, at no additional cost.  Have I gotten this correctly?
Through requesting to speak to a supervisor and then to a manager, it is clear that no one wanted to listen or hear me.  I can no longer say that I do not worry about viruses, spyware, spam, phishing scams, hackers, identity theft, or confidently surf the web, send e-mails, and shop and bank on-line because I am a subscriber of McAfee.  Note, I am very careful about where I go on the net and what programs I allow and receive on my computer.
I contacted their billing department and cancelled my automatic renewal for 2015.  I will be looking for another security protection program that will provide better support before, during, and after a situation arises, known or unknown, on ones computer and not take them  to the bank ($), as well.
I give my one time need for additional support and assistance from McAfee an F and will advise all who will listen to beware of McAfee protection.  I have found it to be anything but that  protection.  Buyers - beware!"
"Rather than continue to respond to the ridiculous comments this review keeps getting, I will simply edit it. My original review is below. I have been told in the comments that I didn't ""understand"" how this program works when I bought it. With that I agree. I expected to be able to edit graphics. Apparently I'm too stupid to understand that a program called a ""graphics studio"" will not allow me to do that.

Let me quote from the box the installation CD came in:

""A complete graphics package and a value for the money.""

""The all-in-one studio for professional quality creative design.""

So, from this, I was supposed to infer that editing existing gifs, jpgs, etc, was not going to be possible?

I suggest to anyone thinking of buying this ""graphics studio"", and seeing all the unhelpful votes I got, that you consider it was the employees of the company that makes this software who gave me those negative votes.

-----------------------

I agree with the previous reviewer about everything.

I bought the program because of some of the cool shape options it had, which I needed to create some new images for a website. Fine.

Since it's a graphics program, you might expect that you could, for example, open a GIF or JPG file with it for editing, right? -- grab part of the image so you could move it a few pixels, that kind of thing? Nope. I even went to the Serif DrawPlus users forum when I couldn't figure out what I was ""doing wrong"", and was told ""No, you can't. It opens everything as a bitmap.""

Truly, I could not believe what I was hearing. A graphics program that doesn't let you edit graphics."
Doesn't work wasted a lot of time for nothing
Worked well
I'm new to Quilting and teaching myself.  I've read many books on how to quilt and have a very good idea of what needs to be done.  My problem was putting together blocks and colors.  This software is the best.  I just love it.  I have designed several quilts that looks great and the software provided me with the amount of material that was needed.  It is worth purchasing this software to help you with the designing of quilts.
This product lives up to its name.
Pinnacle cannot render itself out of a paper bag.  Not being able to correctly render your own project files is pretty pathetic.....
Successful tax year
I think Quicken is the best product out there for handling financial concerns. I have been using Quicken since the days of DOS.
lots of problems with software.
This is the best product I have ever used for my computer.  You will never have to worry about anything ever again.
"After only 2 months on McAfee our computer was almost inoperable. Had to take it to an IT
company only to find out we had malware of which McAfee failed to protect our computer.
IT guy removed McAfee from our computer and installed another brand of security software.
We paid $99.99 for a 2 year subscription and only used it for 2 months. McAfee refused to
issue any type of a refund. Would NEVER purchase another McAfee product."
it ok but pc runs slower
I have used TurboTax for Mac for the past several years with no problem.  This year I wasted my money.  The downloads won't work and the online support is useless.  I have followed the directions to the letter repeatedly and still no solution.  They have lost a loyal user.  Don't buy this product if you use a Mac!
product was delivered as promised.
good deal for me
"This will be the 11th year that I have used TurboTax to prepare my Federal tax return. Eleven years ago the user interface was a little difficult but workable. Last year the product was great and I expect it to continue to improve. Over the years, I have learned that the product is not infallible and some (but very few) mistakes were made, especially in the area of education credits and whether a ""Hope"" or ""Lifetime"" learning credit applies. I was able to successfully navigate through this problem but had to force it into the appropriate category. It remains important for the user to be aware of the tax laws so as not to be surprised by these problems.

I have always used the ""Basic"" version and have found that it meets all my needs including self-employment forms, capital gains, pensions, child care expenses, various tax credits such as the residential energy credit, and many, many more. I have never used the ""State"" product since state tax returns can be filed in New Mexico over the internet at no cost. You should check with your state to see if it has similar programs.

The only real problem with TurboTax is that the program is released early and before any federal forms are finalized. The update process is easy enough, but if you have a dial-up connection it will take a good bit of time. With a ""real"" high-speed connection such as cable, it's no sweat. This year it took me about a minute. I personally like to begin my return in December, so this is not a problem for me.

Another great feature is that you can copy personal information such as names, SSN, filing status, etc. from the previous year so you don't have to retype it this year. It also copies financial institution and W2 information which can be edited for the current year without retyping names, tax ID numbers, etc.

I highly recommend TurboTax and wouldn't use any other."
"I've been a Norton user for over 20 years now.  I've never had a virus on any of my computers, but I also try to avoid suspicious web sites and attachments from people I don't know."
"I requested a review copy of this software for my two daughters who are very interested in animation, art, sketching and drawing. This software gave them a chance to really see how far they could take their talents. For them this software was fairly easy to use, for me I probably could not have learned it like them with my lack of artistic ability. It is a great package to use for designing and creating."
Each year gets easier. Wish we could e-file the California state tax return without paying such an incredibly high fee.
"Great service, great movie"
"Excellent Product !!!  It's Currently being used by a physician with an accent and it's picking up all his wording.  Excellent Shipping and customer service!!!
A+++++"
registered 1 on line and 1 by automated phone both worked fine
I am having trouble getting support for this item since it will not install onto my computer.
"Great software, cheap, and gets the job done. I do video editing as well as commentary, and it has served me well. I highly recommend this for those beginning with video making/editing."
"After reading numerous reviews of resume' programs I decided to go with Resume' Works Pro, and was glad I did. Putting together resumes' and cover letters has never been easier. The templates offered cover virtually any situation and profession. This beats the previous program I used by a country mile."
"I could not do without this app. I have it on my PC, Laptop and now my Surface 3 tablet. I have all of my books available to me on all three machines and I can read the same book while moving between machines and Kindle will offer to take me to where I left off on one of the other machines so I can just continue reading.  I love the Missing Manual series of books (Office, Windows & Photoshop Elements) and have always been frustrated with the printed books because I would have to have both the book and computer to try out a feature I was reading about. No longer. I bought the Kindle version of Office 2013 and Windows 10 and now I can read about a feature and go straight to the program and try it out. A true learning experience. And this comes from a person who always said that they would hate to read book off the computer."
This product is great. It installed easily and I have had no problems whatsoever with my computer after installing it.
"This program is two years away from being ready for the public use.  WAIT until there are many updates and repairs before you buy.  It is so bad that I am thinking of changing to Apple, no computer should be this much work.  I would pay twice what I paid for this program to get back my old XP version."
"I have been a satisfied Quicken user for over 20 years, but I am actively seeking an alternative. I have experienced numerous glitches and missing transactions. Since Release 11 of Quicken 2016, I have been unable to download transactions from my brokerage linked checking account. Despite long waits on hold and over 6 hours of work with Quicken tech support, there is no working solution except to upgrade to Quicken 2017. I recommend you avoid Quicken and find another product."
"I've been using Turbo Tax since the late 90's. As always the program performs flawlessly, saves a great deal of time and calculates my tax perfectly.
I'll use no other program. I see there was a lot of angry customers due to the changes  in the Deluxe version this year. Rightly so, but at least Intuit made amends for that poor decision. If  I ever need to upgrade from Deluxe, I'll do so without hesitation. And by the way, one of my returns was questioned by the IRS and they demanded a large portion of my Federal refund be returned. I obliged and immediately contacted Turbo Tax  quality control satisfaction team about the discrepancy. I forwarded the Turbo Tax response via email to the IRS and within three weeks the IRS  returned  my money (in full) with interest!  How many tax paying citizens can say that? The IRS made the mistake, not Turbo Tax. Had I done my taxes without Turbo Tax and their stellar support, I  would never have known the IRS form was inaccurate. I'm a Turbo Tax customer for life!"
"I am sure it is partly the fault of the IRS last minute decisions about how to handle glbt couples, but I felt Turbo Tax could have developed a more comprehensive and less cumbersome tool for dealing with this situation.  Hopefully next year!"
"I'd rate this as ZERO stars if I could - BE WARNED - NO STATE PROGRAM IS INCLUDED AND THEY WANT TO CHARGE YOU $40 FOR IT - It's buried in the fine print underneath the hidden part of the description dropdown menu.  Meanwhile, the thing is labeled exactly the same as last year.

I see that you've taken the TurboTax route and want to ____ your customers - guess what - I'll never buy or use any of your products again."
"Since Quicken dropped support for Lion, finding a decent personal finance management application was a challenge.  There is a bit of a learning curve, but it worked for our needs.

The only issue was with synchronizing data with the iPhone.  The Mac needed to be on the same subnet as the phone, which means you can't be running multiple vlans as far as the two devices are concerned."
The disk arrived cracked.
"This purchase was delivered within a few days and
I am a satisfied amazon shopper .
Thanks"
"We were replacing Quickbooks 2002 on our office accounting computer and this installed fairly easily.  It did require a telephone call to Intuit to activate it and they gave the code after semi-pleading that we toss our XP computer and buy a Windows 7 machine and their 2014 QuickBooks.  Not going to happen, too many things to port over and half probably wouldn't work on Windows 7.

So, confirmed this works with XP, asks if you want to keep the old QuickBooks on your system or replace it, and in general installs fine.  The rest is QuickBooks, works, not ideal, but I don't know of anything that is.

Plays nice with QuickBooks 2002 installed on the same machine."
"This seems like a great genealogy program.  I have been using Ancestry.com for several years, and have decided that I wanted to get this on my hard drive so that I can share it with all of my cousins.  Disappointed that Ancestry wouldn't copy the pictures over to Family Historian."
"I have used Turbo Tax software for years and it is consistently very easy to navigate, and very reliable. I have only had a few issues over the years, but never anything that has kept me from re-using. A great product for people who are already relatively tax-savvy and are looking to save a few $$$!"
"Very nice app. It is simple, with all the necessary features and no bloat."
Love Jump Start products. I have used them for both of my kids. Thanks for making a great learning DVD
"Having used Maximizer for several years, I bought 6.0 because the people at Multiactive sold me on the MaxAction project scheduler.  You design a series of tasks and assign the track to a person, then your hotlist tracks which task to do when.  Problem is 1. It tracks some tasks without associating them to the person so you know you're supposed to call someone, you just don't know who.  2. Tech support says no one ever uses MaxAction so they know nothing about how it works.  3. There is no documentation in the online help, the website, or the manual on MaxAction and how to use it.  But they'll be happy to take your money for support and then tell you they can't help you, but thanks for paying anyway.  This was a good product once and I don't know how others are, but I'd look into Act or Goldmine or Telemagic before I'd go anywhere near Maximizer.  Even if parts of it work fine, the lack of support and lack of respect for their customers should convince anyone to run...FAST!"
This is a very good training program
"This is a piece of junk.  Six months into my subscription they told me it expired then charged me again.  When I tried to download this junk it wouldnt work.  Contacted their senior management and they told me ""we are having some problems, get back to you later"".  Protection DON'T THINK SO and as far as Amazon be careful"
I always buy TurboTax. It gets the job done. Its features are adaquate. It is sometimes hard to manueve around but overall it's a decent product.
Expect to pay an additional $39.99 to file your state taxes if you purchase this product.  I've used TurboTax for 10 years but next year unless the product is restored to it's former features I will find another online tax service to do my taxes.  Very disappointing.
I've been using HR Block for many years and I have never been dissatisfied.  Always easy to use and never have trouble with the IRS.
"I was not that impressed by this product. It found some spyware, but I found ""Scan Spyware"" [...] software to be much more comprehensive and offer better protection. I am in no way affiliated with that company, I just like their product."
Excellent software.
Works perfectly! Couldn't be more pleased!
This software package is a piece of junk.  I have spent hours loading pictures into slideshows only to have the program abort when it starts to encode the Menu (error 8007000e).  Roxio's website provides no help and their response is none existent.  Do not buy this package.
"Great product! My computer crashed a month after I bought this, so now I just hope I can transfer it over to my new one so that I don't have to buy it again. Crossing my fingers because that would suck."
I have used this product product for a year and I love it. It keeps my computer free of clutter and running smoothly.
We are doing a major remodel overhaul in our entire house and adding on an addition. This program was a great way to draw out our plans.
"When I purchased my laptop new with Vista loaded on it, I did not realize the Office program was a ""trial period"" since up to that time, every new computer I have purchased came with all the programs on board as part of the price for the computer. When I ended up with no Office program at the end of the trial period, I loaded the Office portion of our XP from the PC. It worked OK for awhile, but it was difficult to coordinate applications between the XP and Vista. So, I went on a search for an Office 2007 I could afford and found it on Amazon. I was really sceptical at first, but after I downloaded it and learned how to use the new Word program, I was really glad I had bought it on Amazon. You really cannot go wrong with the care Amazon takes in assuring used items from other sellers are what they say they are or your money is refunded. Didn't have to do that and my purchase was a great find!"
Used this instead of turbo tax for the first time.  Data transferred over to H and R with no problems. I will use it again.
Only in the beginning but whet I read so far seen to be the study book I've been looking for.
The Norton Internet Security 2014 - 1 Year / 3 works well for all three of my computers. Michael
"I've been using Turbo Tax since 1992 but the 2014 version is ANYTHING but deluxe.  I can't do my rental property or investment income.  I am very disappointed in the product this year.  The manner in which the previous functionality was removed has left me feeling abused and cheated by Intuit, Inc..  This is not what I expected from a company that, until now, I had regarded highly.  It's unlikely, I will be a customer in the future."
"Amazon pop-up window advertised that this software requires Mac OS X 10.5 or higher. False: it requires 10.7 or higher, which is not shown until you purchase it."
"I got Norton AV pre-installed into my Gateway 7422GX (6-month trial). It started being a real pain with those pop-up notices about ""your antivirus subscription ends in x days, please upgrade"", and the only options were to be reminded later, or ""purchase subscription now"". There was no ""do not bug me again"" or ""do not remind me again"".

So obviously Symantec wants to annoy the consumer a lot in order to get their dollars. I also noticed that Norton AV was using a LOT of resources (both RAM and CPU), much more than other antivirus I have running in other windows systems (Kaspersky AV -commercial, and AVG - Free Ed.).

So guess what I did?, I headed over to grisoft.com and downloaded the ""Free edition"" (free for home, non-commercial use) of AVG antivirus and I'm much more pleased with AVG now, it uses less resources and updates faster. AVG gets new virus definitions almost every day. The AVG resident shield also identified and cleaned two viruses (leaving the original .exe files fully functional, not just rendering them unusable and ""quarantining"" them like Norton AV often does).

And you can't beat the price of AVG!. Short story: before spending your hard earned money on this bloated piece of AV software, try some of the alternatives out there from smaller software companies that produce more efficient code: AVG, Bitdefender, Avast!, Kaspersky, etc.

I can really vouch for the free edition of AVG antivurs from Grisoft.com. Bitdefender is even leaner but the free version of Bitdefender doesn't have a resident scanner (you have to purchase the full version)."
"As a long time Quicken user on Windows I am beyond disappointed in the Mac version, to be frank I think it is FUBAR.  If you haven't used the Windows version and/or are new to software to track & manage your finances it may be OK.  Or if all you want to track is your checking account from one of the supported banks that may be OK too.  But if you're intending to also track your investments, mortgage, and any other loan, forget it.

What really kills me is Intuit clearly had years of experience in understanding what users want to track and manage and built that functionality into the Windows versions.  But somehow precious little of that knowledge appears to have been leveraged in building the Mac version:

Let's start with tracking paycheck data.  Windows version template for a paycheck and easy ability to input/track deductions by type....gone in the Mac.  Really Intuit, you couldn't include a template for paychecks?  Pretty much anyone tracking their finances is getting paid by someone or they wouldn't be buying your product.  Maybe you're not paying your programmers so they don't think tracking a paycheck is necessary.

Then let's talk about tracking loans.  Car loans, lots of people have them, the Windows version tracks loan details and calculates interest vs principal on monthly payments so that even if your bank does not support download of that info, you can still track it.  Windows version has similar template & support for Mortgage loans.  The Mac version just lumps all loans into a generic ""liability"" category without even including specific fields for the basic pertinent information (e.g. principal, interest rate, duration).  In fact the only really unique field is ""credit limit' which does not apply to either a mortgage or a car loan.  It's completely ridiculous not to at least include the appropriate data fields for future use.  That data could have been transferred over from my Windows version and at least used in some future release.  It just blows my mind that a financial management package can't handle a loan payoff schedule.

And then there's the data transfer.....I followed the instructions fully.  Yeah most of my data is there but somehow my investment accounts (401k & IRA) don't match, even after download from the institutions.  Judging from what I see it will take me several hours of corrections to get the balances correct and I'll probably never get the cost basis (which is critical) straightened out.

Sadly the only reason I bought this package was that my PC was about to die and since Windows 8 is garbage I thought maybe shift to Mac was a safer bet.  However this childish offer from Intuit makes an otherwise smart move quite ill-informed.  And I did look at the Quicken Windows to Mac comparison first....but apparently I was blinded by the lipstick on this pig of a product."
"This is the most aggravating program I've tried to run. It is definitely not user friendly when it comes to the install. Then if you want to call for support you have to pay for it. I just brought the program, why do I have to pay for support?! When I finally got it installed, now it won't open! This was the biggest waste of time and money!"
"This was exactly was I needed.  I recently purchased a new PC with XP.  I needed Office but didn't want to buy Office 2007 for an XP.  It's getting hard to find Office 2003 anymore.  This worked out perfectly.  I was concerned that it wouldn't include a valid license, but it did.  The install was a snap.  If you need a new install of Office 2003, this is it.  You can't beat the price -- it's much less than what Office 2003 used to go for."
Product code did not work and now I'm out $35 since item is non-refundable.  What kind of service is that?
"It was very helpful, and great bargain, and a good beginners teaching instrument.  Highly Recommeded!"
When I tried to download the program it didn't work.  When I called Microsoft I was told that the key code was pirated and they would not let me download.  I did get a refund from Amazon.  I would not buy something like this again from Amazon .
"I am a huge fan of Print Master, BUT!! I am still waiting to get my PC back, as the program crashed my computer!! I used an older version for years on my old PC, and was excited to receive the new version for my new PC. Not happy when it crashed my computer. At $19.95 you get what you pay for. Should have paid the $39.95 and ordered from Broderbund."
I have used TurboTax Premier for over five years and I find it to be the best way to compile my personal and rental property income and expenses and apply the latest tax codes to may annual tax returns.
This is an outstanding course--the best of its kind that I have ever seen.
Ok
I'm only buying this because SUPRISE!....my 2011 no longer updates via bank download or link up via Quicken. I think it's criminal that they bottleneck you so you have to buy the next version. It's also crap that there are no other options next to breaking out the ole' paper check register! Someone needs to give Quicken some consumer competition because this is getting ridiculous.
Price was right and for once software that was easy to install. Guess it is doing its thing won't know unless there is a problem. Came quickly and would recommend
After more than 25 years of doing my taxes with Turbo Tax I bought this product.  I cannot recommend it as it does not do all aspects of the taxes in a format that can be submitted electronically.  Intuit decided to force all buyers to get their more expensive product.  I will be making in a change and no longer using Turbo Tax.  It was a good run as there are few products that I have used for 25 years.  Too bad they got greedy.
"We purchased this card prior to a trip to Italy.  On our first day of driving, it got us lost in the suburbs of Florence, sending us through a tangle of roads that went nowhere."
"I bought this to learn Igbo along with my son, but I couldn't get it to work right. It had some glitches in the program and was a waste of time and money. I wanted a voice recording of how to sound out the words and vowel sounds. VERY DISAPPOINTED! Nobody to contact rearding the issue. I don't think I will order from outside my country again. I will stick to reading the book instead."
"Keeps crashing..
Horrible"
I bought this software for my daugter-in-law. She has been able to addd twice as much to our family as she did before. It also links up to allow us to print her work in book or poster form.
"For anyone who writes a lot of material, I am here to tell you that this a very affordable life saving back up program to have on your computer. A number of months ago, my main word processing program stopped working correctly. Tried to re install it and tried to fix it in other ways and nothing worked. Considered purchasing a new and similar office program from the same company but for me right that is not an easily affordable solution; it was a fairly advanced and expensive computer program and I still did not fully know why it wouldn't let edit or save any of my work. I was very frustrated as it seemed all my writing creativity came to a screeching halt. I used the basic Wordpad program for a bit but that was not meeting my needs. After some research, I found this program, did some reading on it, and found it here at Amazon so I downloaded it. Whew! Saved by the Apacha Open Office program as I could once again start writing, editing and saving, all of my work. I did get the other word processing/office program to work again but I am very glad to have the Apache Open Office as a back up for the future. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it doesn't have a word count feature on it or at least I haven't found that yet. If you are writing a magazine article or term paper or something along those lines you need to keep track of your word count. Submitting an accurate word count figure with your article, story or paper is often required. It is not as advanced as some of the other word processing or office programs out there but it still a very valuable program to have on hand! Furthermore it includes other great and useful features beyond word processing including: spreadsheet, presentation, drawing, database. I haven't dived into all of these yet but so far I am very pleased to have it."

Excellent  product. I had it for a year and this purchase  was for a renewal. Less on amazon  than buying  direct. Not a single virus issue.
"I used Quicken for years and loved it. Of course, that was the Microsoft version. Quicken for Mac is a joke. Nothing can be customized; budgets are 3 months or nothing. It is like some basic beta package for third graders. DO NOT buy Quicken for a Mac."
"It crashes when you load it in windows 10. I tried on two computers, same result. Tried to get tech support and I must say it is almost non existent. They will only support for free with e-mail. Great I can't run it but I have to pay for phone support. I tried all the normal things, compatibility troubleshooter, run as administrator to no avail. Sent support e-mail and 6 days after delivery of product I got return e-mail asking me to do the same things I told them in my support email I already did. I returned it. Goodbye Corel."
Didn't work. Wouldn't load on my computer. Disappointed.
"very good software , I like very much ...easy to use"
Great deal on an excellent product.
"Purchased TurboTax reluctantly, after disappointment with TaxAct, only to find that a form provided to settle my father's estate is not included. For this, Intuit wants another $75 for a new software package. No update credit, for which I would gladly pay.

About what I have come to expect from Intuit. At least I was not disappointed in my low opinion.

Back to TaxAct and $55 wasted."
"The product was easy to install but sometimes would not launch when you tried to pull it up.

Also, on almost every single occasion, an error would occur during recording and shut down the program, causing me to waste hours of time and causing extreme frustration.

I would not recommend this product to anyone for any reason. PAY THE EXTRA MONEY AND GET A PROGRAM THAT WORKS!!!"
"I was expecting version 6 which I tested for a week using the trial I download from the manufacture's website. The version I was sent was version 5. I suppose I should have known the price was too good to be true. There was a free upgrade to 5.5 and despite my disappointment about the product I thought I was receiving I found that it more than meets my needs. I can sign documents, scan documents and create a single pdf's by combining multiple files. It's not as pretty as Adobe and but it is a lot more intuitive. Overall I'm happy with the purchase. I do however wish I had the latest version."
Never even heard of a version that wasn't one year at least so I didn't read the find print - 6 months!  Felt like an idiot and won't buy a thing from Norton ever again.  Any company that escorts to trickery to lower their price is like the people selling ketchup and laundry soap that reduce the weight but keep the price the same hoping nobody notices.
"Had 2010 on my old Win 7 ,before Microsoft screwed it up with thier Win 10 update crap !!"
"I bought this product a week ago and are still trying to get it to work right. Eight hours of reading text, downloading papers and letting the software scan all my college papers on my jump drive resulted in the system recoqnizing fifty two additional words out of thousands in that file. I am going to get the update for windows Vista and see if that helps but the only reason I am not really upset is because I got this product at eightyfive percent off and still belive I paid too much."
It's free for most newer macs.
"I bought ""Guitar Hero: World Tour"" week ago.
I enjoyed it so I decided to buy this.
The requirement for that game was Vista/XP (according to the info on the back of the CD case). The product description on the site didn't include any system requirements. I found out about the requirements when I got the CD so I called Amazon and asked if I can send it back if it doesn't work on my laptop.
I have Alienware 17 R1.
<Window 7 64-bit.
CPU: 4th generation i7-4700MQ.
GPU: NVIDIA GTX770M
RAM: 16GB>
I tried ""Guitar Hero: World Tour,"" on my Alienware and it worked (even though it said it's for XP and Vista)!
This game is for XP and Vista as well, but I figured it is going to work too.
Well it didn't. I couldn't even install it in the first place.
So...I tried on my Dell Inspiron 1545. It's my other laptop that I used for about 4 years. It's old, but it still functions well.
It's got Vista with Pentium Dual-Core CPU.
The game didn't work for this laptop.
I don't know if its just my laptops, but it didn't work for either of them.
I'm disappointed :/"
Love this product but wish I had waited for the free upgrade Microsoft has offered after the fact.
I buy these every year and they work well in protecting our computers. I did have a slight problem installing the program on my lap top. I contacted online support which directed me to remove the previous kapersky software. I thought it was already off since it had expired days before. Had no such problem with our all in one system. Great buy for one disk which covers 3 PCs. Will purchase again this time next year. FYI..Buying this product from Amazon saves you a lot verses buying directly from Kapersky!
"I was a little apprehensive about the whole windows Eco-system but I found everything to be pretty decent for the most part. I still prefer the Mac OS, but these 100 bucks weren't spent badly. I would definitely recommend windows 8 to a friend"
Helped bridge the OS gap I negligently let my Mac fall into! Which always beats buying a new computer. Well done
it is OK
Excellent for kids! Bought several as gifts ;) Great for tweens anf middle school kids teaches them how to type very well.
"I used to have Quicken for my PC and just changed to Mac. It's very different and taking some getting used to. When I enter a transaction and start typing in the name of the Payee, the list of possibilities from previous transactions is much more complete with the Mac version and I really like it. On the minus side, after reconciling an account, there isn't a column that shows if each entry was cleared or not. You have to click on Reconcile in order to get this information. Also, you have to click on Edit in order to see the memo line, which I find cumbersome. Overall, I'm okay with it, but I did like the version for Windows better."
"I had to reformat my computer to remove Windows 10 which completely messed up my acer desktop. When I reinstalled windows utilities my $56 registration was not accepted. On telephoning the help line I was told that I needed to give online access to my computer so that the technician could "" wipe the old software"".  After I finished laughing I realized he was deadly serious.  Either the helpline has been hacked or the programmers have completely lost their minds. All I wanted was a new registration number.  The product is not that good, and the helpline on another continent.
Dont waste your money ~ go for one of the mainstream options not this one."
Got some viruses that I didn't get warned about.  Ending up getting another Anti-walware product in addition.  Like lots of the other features though.
"I installed it today and I can't tell you how happy I am.
The graphics and the games that are added are simply amazing.
My favorite is the Fish Tank screen saver. The fish look very real.
For a price as low as $, I must say: Go and buy it!"
"It's good - what I expected.  And it is intense.  I'm working my way through the  Infinite Skills training DVD I bought, and I have a printed guide on the way, too.  I'd say ""Be prepared to spend the time required to master this tool."""
IT IS JUNK!!!!!!!!!!
"My 3 yr old doesn't ""get it"" yet...but my 4 yr old loves it!  This game teaches early math skills in a fun way!  The kids earn tickets as they get things correct and can ""buy"" things with their tickets.  Not a tough game as you would think -being a ""math"" one...it is fun!  It is worth the money & your kids will enjoy the time they spend on it.

"This is the third year I used the H&R Block software to file my taxes. I will use it again next year as well. It is easy to use, and it's easy to go back and look at past years."
I had an ancient version of Quickbooks on my laptop that finally crashed and couldn't install this old version on my new laptop.  I purchased QuickBooks Pro 2015 hoping that all my data would transfer over.  It did and fairly easily!  I am happy with this software.
Great free antivirus software!  Recommended by a dear friend with an 18 year old grandson!  Works like a champ!
"WordPerfect has always been the standard for controlling any word processing document, without the clutter of unnecessary hidden codes, interface complexity and limited cross file integration -- all of which are hallmarks of MS Word. I've used both since their beginnings, and WP has always stayed focused on the writer's mission for document control.

This latest version only builds on the standard real authors require, by adding to, and not substituting the familiar tools we've all come to appreciate and depend on. Reveal Codes, is one key element only WP has, and makes document control painless and assured; something you won't find elsewhere. With WP X7's newest MS Word and Adobe PDF integration, there is no reason to upgrade or keep those as stand-alone programs too; X7 covers it.

One last point: In a world of corporate changes that obsolete brands, it is very nice to see a true pioneer and leader of the word processing environment remain and thrive. WordPerfect is the Real Standard."
I have used this program for many years and have yet to run into a situation that was not handled by the software.  Easy for any one to prepare their taxes.
Great product. Easy to install and doesn't interfere or slow down anything I'm using on my computer. I feel like my computer is very well protected. And a very good price! I definitely recommend this product.
"I built my first computer in 1998, inserting cards into ISA slots, loading Windows 3.1, downloading drivers, fighting to make the sound card cooperate with the 56k phone modem. Windows 8.1 is the most frustrating piece of crap I have encountered to date. I will concede that Microsoft may be able to create something worse in the future, but for now...this is an abomination.
It presents you with apps you don't want, while hiding the file structure you do want. Thumbnails of my videos disappeared to be replaced by icons. A password is required for logon by default...I don't want to enter a password to logon. I have to pay $100 for Windows Media Center that was integrated into Win7. Just venting here. I'm not going to switch to OS X or linux but I'm not a satisfied Win8 customer."
"Very good and effective program. The second one I've tried from this company. Both were easy to install and users instructions are clear. The only complaints I have is they used to deliver to Canada and they don't anymore. I live in Quebec so it was very difficult and complicated to get this product. And the customer service over the phone is not very effective. No one answers directly and I had to leave 3 messages, the last one being very angry, before they called back."
l love this app
I have several of the MOVAVI packages and they're all great.  Easy to use and even a novice like me can use them.  Worth every penny!!  Best of all not expensive.  Keep up the good work MOVAVI
"Well, my windows XP computer finally crapped out. had to rebuild it. I was a little skeptical on how the new software & new computer parts were going to work, but they married & are living happily ever after. the software actually works better than the XP ever did. set ups for network & printing are sooooo much easier. Surfs Up"
"First time user of windows products . Always used Linux systems. Found windows 7 easy to use ,so much that I got windows 8."
"I am a first time user of this program and I think it is sufficient for folks with simple tax returns.  I think the interview wizard in the program is similar to TurboTax but it does not give enough information sometimes.  It does not accept negative income amount (loss) when doing K-1 and it stops asking values at item 13 (i.e. no items 17 to 20) on the K-1 form.  It will be a big improvement if HRB can beef up their K-1 handling next year.  Currently their K-1 handling function is bare minimum when comparing to TurboTax.

To some users who cannot import their stock brokerage account information online when the program says your login information incorrect they may try to use the document ID (from your stock brokerage's online 1099) instead of their actual user ID.  It is a bug in their software and in my case I am able to import my stock transactions information if I use my document ID instead of my normal user ID."
I can't really post a good or bad comment. I did some temporary work for my old company and only one person is still using this software. We could not get it on any other computer so we thought we could buy this one and put it on another computer for me to work on. We got several things wrong first with this being a single computer version and not the deluxe so we never got the chance to use it. Now it's just sitting in a box in my garage.
"I only use trend micro, the best security of them all."
What a Scam this is. The picture they use shows the cd yes thats fine but behind it you can see the productivity list that comes with it with the serial number is what I really wanted. Worthless purchase and half the truth and I would never buy from this false seller ever.
"everything was as I expected and the product worked great and arrived in good shape, on time, and did the job I needed it to do"
"Great value for the money, lots of capabilities, I highly suggest it. I've been using MS Publisher since 2003 and love it."
Junk compared to itunes. Free is too much to charge for this junk. Slow downloads. Don't waste your time. Go apple
"In my experience (3 PCs, Win 98) this is the best software I've encountered to date.  Intuitive, with excellent wizards, a good manual, and friendly technical help--if you have a bad HD like I did.  I would never  have attempted multiple partitions without this product.  PowerQuest has a  real winner here."
Cannot get the pen to work.  Absolutely infuriating.  Will be returning.
"I found that it is gritty or grainy and it had a strange taste. I was really hoping to like product, because it would make getting the protein that I need for the day much easier. I will continue to try it in other things before I just stop trying to make it work."
"I bought my dad a copy of McAfee Total Protection for his birthday and he seemed pretty happy with it.  He started having a problem with his computer and McAfee was displaying pop-ups that he wasn't protected.  He called McAfee and they told him that he had a trojan on his computer.  They said that they'd clean it off for $300.  I can't believe he paid them, but they had him so scared that he'd transfer it to someone else or infect any new computer he got that he went ahead with it.  I can't believe the audacity of them - first their program lets the virus on his system and then they have the nerve to charge him $300 to remove it.  I immediately took McAfee off of my system and let Microsoft install its freeware antivirus program."
a great way for little ones to learn
This was not the thing for me. I would not buy again.
"Useless can't get microphone to work. Tried several times to get the microphone to work, had someone else try it all is a go by the settings but will not recognize microphone being connected."
Quickbooks with payroll very easy anyone can do it. Will not pay anyone to do payroll any longer I am hooked.
"I first purchased this software while in college for a class project. We had to start a buisness, name it, hire employees, and manage it within a three week period. One requirement was to have a presentation at the end. So I used this software to design my car dealership. It did produce a good visual and 3D model to use. The software is a little hard to use, the colors are off, and the included extras (cars, funiture, tv's, ect.) need to be updated to this century, and heaven forbid that you try to create your own extras, the creation wizard is more geared toward a engineer than someone who is building their house for fun.

I see that version 5000 is out now, hopefully they have improved it from the previous version."
buy and after 1 year again and again .... all update cost the same price... NO FREE Updete at all
"I've used this many times in the past year or so.  It works great.  My wife and I RV a lot, so it really gets a workout.  I particularly like the ""Find Nearby Places"" tool.  It has taken us to some great eating places.  It contains so much information that I can't even come close to describing the content.  Suffice to say, if you own a laptop that you can take on the road, this GPS/mapping program is a must."
Not exactly what I wanted and have not used it. Still on my computer if I do.
Ordered this for my nephew and he was totally thrilled with this gift.  His parents said it was awesome. Thanks
"I read how the buyers of this product watched their computers turn into processing sloths, bought a copy and watched my 2.4 Gig XP Pro processor slow down below the level of my 750 Meg 2000Pro laptop! At the same time I bought PC-Cillin for the laptop and what a slick product!

So now, when we type, half the time the XP Pro 2.4 Gig PC lags behind the input, sometime by 10 characters!

Symantec should give us all a refund and apology! I will NEVER buy their product again at this rate, and neither should you.

BEWARE!!!!"
"As i told webroot when i installed it just a month ago ""brilliant:"" I was on the point of buying another laptop as mine was driving me mad! performance vary'd day to day, in a last desperate effort i tried Webroot, incredibly the first scan worked miracles,my ""VIO""is still going strong Thanks a lot."
"It is old, incomplete and incapable of keeping up with today's hardware. Even then, years ago it was glitchy, full of bugs and crashing. If you think of red hat, get fedora or centos because today's real Enterprise Red Hat is very expensive and completely different from this one. Get Fedora, on a moment of writing Fedora 13 is the newest."
"This version of Corelcad seems to be less functional than its original heir. I bought Corelcad back in 1996. It was a more complete program and came with Corel3dDream, templates, a material library and a half decent renderer, along with  many other offerings, such as CorelSCRIPT. This current version is around $500. For double the price you can get Rhinoceros 5, which will do anything Corelcad does and more. It is easier to learn, has a million tutorials on the web and a fantastic forum. I would advise you to download a free trial of Rhinoceros 5. It will allow 25 saves and will amaze you in its modelling abilities and the plug ins made for it tackle every field of Cad and design that you could wish for. If you do end up purchasing Rhinoceros 5 and you have a Mac, like I do, you can go onto the Rhino OSX testing program and use the Mac version. I started using Rhinoceros when it was a plugin for Autocad and have been using it ever since. It is fantastic value for money."
"It was easy to work with, especially since it had so much of my informtionfrom former years already stored. I will continue to use it"
"It will not work on my computer. I had windows xp and it should have worked, but doesn't. I only paid $2.99, that should have been a sign it wouldn't work. I really wish this would have worked because it looked very interesting......"
great application .
"For a casual to semi-serious photographer or aspiring filmmaker, this package is hard to beat for the price. The included tools might not be quite as powerful as Photoshop CS, but it's a far more comprehensive toolset than Photoshop Elements, and some tools work significantly better than PSE. For example, something as simple as rotating an image results in shearing of straight lines in PSE, but Corel PaintShop Photo Pro performs the operation flawlessly.

I'm not as well versed in video editing software, and I mostly only use it for slideshows, but this is a capable package. There is some difficulty with a seemingly outdated method for producing DVDs, which is the reason for one star off. It's still doable, and hopefully they've fixed this in the new version.

I've had a great experience with this package, and I have high hopes for the newer version and will probably be purchasing it soon."
"Looks, feels, acts just like 2015. Only new feature I can find is the ability to link scheduled items to the payee's online site (whoopie). If I stuck this in front of a 2015 user they'd never know the difference. Should have saved the $70 and waited until the new owner came in; this was a poor use of money. At least I get to write it off my taxes..."
It worked fine. It was a easy download.
Good deal the time and free shipping on prime
This is an excellent program & I highly recommend it. The learning curve is very easy to understand. The extra add on & the included green screen is worth the price of the box. I have all ready fixed a few videos with this program & I'm still tinkering & having a great time with all the effects included in the kit.
"A definite improvement over earlier versions.  I upgraded from 2006.  The software is easier to use, and the GPS directions are better than earlier versions.  Don't worry about the negative reviews claiming the earlier versions are better.

I would give it 5 stars except for the license restriction.  I want to install it on my home PC and 2 laptops, but it will only allow 2 installs.  I'm also worried what will happen if it becomes corrupt and I need to reinstall it?"
"I overall really like this dashcam, its sleek and stays out of the way, plus the excellent video quality. The first unit I had failed on me with a defective battery but rexing replaced it with a new unit after contacting them.."
"When we opened the Microsoft Office 2010 Training Video (Microsoft Office Made Easy  DVD), it was empty and the plastic at the top was broken."
"Whatever you do, don't allow the software to install a trial edition of Outlook 2010. Since Outlook is not included in the Home and Student edition of Office 2010, you may be tempted. DO NOT! It will hijack your profile (the place where Outlook stores access to ALL your mail, your contacts, your entire life) and ***it will not give it back if you uninstall***

I got hosed this way, just wanna warn you!"
Easy to learn-does a great job
Good product. Still figuring out some of the commands.
works ok
so far it`s doing a great job i love it !!
"This is Federal only.
They demand an additional $44 for the state return or about $70 for the two.
In the past I paid $55 - $60 for both so the price increase was substantial."
"After buying TurboTax for the first time several years ago, I've found how much easier taxes are to do with it instead of without it and plan to buy it again next year.  The telephone support is great, too -- and the consultants I've talked to have gone over-and-above the call of duty to discover the solution to my particular situation.  It's also way cheaper than marriage therapy - and the relative ease of filling in the forms/ answering the questions really makes me a lot easier to live with when it's time to do the taxes!"
"Quicken2002 and Bank@home worked excellently for me.  I import transactions from banks that don't support QFX, using QIF.

The online services ended last month - to continue requires an upgrade that will disable QIF imports.

Intuits answer? Write a letter to your bank or switch banks.

They claim to import OFX, but really they only import thier proprietary QFX version of OFX, and then only if you are online and the bank is on their paid up list.

I didn't upgrade and I withdrew from their online service with my bank - no revenue from upgrade, no revenue from monthly fees at bank.  Great business plan, intuit!"
It replaced my old that was lost with my computer.
I've been using Quicken for quite a few years and this newest version for 2016 has not disappointed me!! Love the ease of use and the fantastic reports I can create to check for any expense or income at any time.
I like H&R over TurboTax on my iMac. It imports from the previous year and prompts me thru the forms.
"Word Perfect is the best, no question about it. I have used it for years and will continue to do so. I have tried other programs (sometimes being forced to) and nothing is as good as Word Perfect. It is powerful, customizable, and extremely user friendly.

"The webroot internet Security works fine but it took me a week to figure out how to unload it and apply it.
I would suggest that you include directions for us computer DUMMIES"
"Well, to say I was disappointed with the 2013 Quicken would be an understatement. Banks, billing, other sites - why do they feel the need to alter what is already a very good and workable product? Anyhow, I had some problems downloading from the banks with this new Quicken, which is why I HAD (yes, HAD) to buy the 2013 Quicken. That I felt was not fair anyway, to take away our downloading benefits from the older Quickens. All that aside, I am using it and I suppose I am getting more used to it as time goes by. I am really glad I didn't pay through the nose for it, as it definitely would not have been worth it and I would probably have returned it by now and started a new system. I don't usually complain about things, but this was not a good ""upgrade"" as they call it, and although I am getting used to it, it has been a long and labourious trek, and I am still having to make new categories, since my old ones don't seem to work any more. We'll get there in the end, but please don't upgrade again. If anything, downgrade to what was very workable! Wish I could have said something more positive, but there you have it."
"Retrospect 6 was the last usable version. Since then, they ruined the product. A backup system should not be less reliable than the systems it's backing up."
"Did these other users not get the same license agreement I got? How could anyone not mind?

The license agreement gives MS an open-ended legal right to make unnamed/unspecified alterations to your software/computer WITHOUT NOTIFICATION.

In other words, by clicking ""I Agree"", the end user is agreeing to allow Microsoft to come in and make whatever changes it sees fit - the language specifically refused to limit what MS could and could not do - and you will not be notified when alterations are made to your computer, your software, etc.

What sort of crazy person is okay with a deal like this? Doesn't anyone read what they are signing, or what?"
I would like to be able to give it no stars. Some individuals got my name and phone number from them and made fraudulent claims to me. What kind of computer security system gives out customer information or is hacked like that. Don't trust this awful company.
I love PC-cillin.  This is the second year I have used it.  I have it installed on 3 computers.  I updates constantly assuring me that my virus protection is secure.  I highly reccommend this program to everyone.
"McAfee is very good...tech help people were excellent.  However, Tech Master help costs more $$;s to fix any problems that could not be fixed by a lower level tech rep.  Although I did not check out the additional costs of Tech Master, which is part of McAfee organization, I would suspect it is lower than the sites of other tech assist  websites I've investigated, and note, this is only an assumption on my part.  As far as protecting your computer(s) I would recommend McAfee over others, and this is only my choice and opinion.

JSY"
Quark is the best. This is my 6th upgrade needed only to be compatible with OS updates.
Easy to install.  I really like that it had three downloads for all my home computers.  I like using  the 2010 version....a great buy.
"This is worthless. Even if you can get the program to work, it has no continuity that makes any sense. There is nothing to explain most of what's happening EXCEPT IN SPANISH and that's worthless if you're TRYING TO LEARN SPANISH. I wasted my money on this and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
crashes at 50% when exporting file to dvd crashes and crashes and crashes and crashes and crashes and crashes
doing a great job!
Easy to update to the 2014 edition. Also to load the mobile app.  still learning the updates and improvements to the new program.
Item shipped quickly and was exactly as described.
Installed software and screen went all blue. Had to remove software before computer would work. Sent back.
"Good value for the money.  wish that it contained outlook; but even w/o it, the ability to put it on up to 3 PCs is great."
Exactly what I was expecting
"So far I did a picture of a couple and made a couple of patterns from it.

I showed them my work and they are so excited to see how well it is coming together.  Will be making a video of how I made this project."
Works very well.
I changed back to another antivirus program that I had used before and like better.  This was GREAT to use till I could get the other back.
getting too pricey
"Great video converter. Super fast when converting .flv files into MP4's. Also handles converting embedded audio the best compared to Handbrake or any of it's competitors. There is a hot folder function as of version 6, which now works great!"
"You know, every year I say the same thing. I'll never use TurboTax again! Then, I remember they have all my information and can easily port over last year's returns to save some time. Ugh. I've had major issues with this program every year I've used it. From their marginally competent at best support, to their deceptive marketing practices (oh, use the program free! but pay a ton for the file, or, pay for the program and the state is free...but not the e-file, just the right to use the state portion of the program!), or the fact that it doesn't find errors until the very, very, very last step even though it has told me it has reviewed everything prior to that.

At least now I'm smart enough to know I'll probably use this crap next year too."
"This product, Russian Now V9 by Transparent Language, is great for language learning.  Being able to hear the words pronounced greatly enhances ones ability to correctly learn the right way to speak Russian.  Russian Now emphasizes the important language skills of listening, speaking, reading & writing and vocabulary & grammar.  The games are excellent and help to provide good practice. The product provides a CD interactive learning experience.  Adding to this is Transparent Language's free web-based learning resource that will support and expand your learning. Overall, this is a well put together and useful learning tool."
Easy to install and new features make it worth it.  May not include drivers for some HP printers.
"It keeps our PC free from bothersome popups by others, but at the same time it produces its own popups all the time. After a week, the virus definition update didn't work anymore and if you read what it could take to remove this product from your PC... you can rather by a new PC. Luckily I did get it to work again but it was a PITA."
"Left Norton after many years because of reviews citing de-contenting, installation issues and foreign support.  (Shades of Turbotax, which I also left after many years.)  I expect products to improve bang for the buck with time, not the opposite.  The CR rating tipped my decision.

ESET SS was an easy install on Win 7 32 bit 4GB RAM, 3.0 Ghz PC. But after what appeared to be a normal install, it informed me that it could not be installed on my operating system - VM Fusion (XP2) on my Mac  with no further explanation, hence 4 stars.  It took a search of ESET's website to find that XP3 was needed, after which it installed easily and seems to work well - cannot detect any slowdown, no intrusive messages."
This program is simply awesome! I improved my score greatly after taking the tests regularly. My favorite part of the program is going back over to look at my mistakes and watching a video explanation for every question. I've already persuaded a friend to get it! It's a great buy and you won't regret it!
"Wordperfect is a professional's writing program put out by Corel, and that company's PDF Fusion is an add-on tool to enhance self-edited publication.
I self-published a little book, submitted it online to my printer in PDF form, and was able to make some further edits such as inclusion of an extra text or illustration page after the book was proofed.  There are distinct limits to how much editing one can do to individual pages, but rearranging, replacing or adding entire pages themselves in the PDF document becomes fairly easy.
If you are self-publishing from any word-processing document and going to PDF, the value is obvious, and (as far as I know) PDF Fusion is the only act in town."
Easy way to prepare taxes. I use it every year.
The download never completes and it missing the software license. I recommend never buying from this reseller again.
"I am pretty experienced on the computer. Many of us fell in love with Windows XP Pro when it first came out. The versions of windows after XP were crap and no one I know had much luck with them. Apple's best friend was later versions of Windows. I did not want to upgrade for this reason. When I saw the ""Big Guy"" on the T.V. a little over a year ago I thought; Now there is an AMERICAN company that may help me keep my XP. I was currently using AVG and it was O.K. but I would occasionally have a glitch with it. Since I switched to PC Matic, I have had absolutely no glitches, my computer runs great, and I have set up two other computers with the protection. The $ 50.00 per year is well worth it. Having that peace of mind is very important. It is re-assuring to know your covered from the nasties on the internet these days. Plus, it's made in America, and that alone makes me happy! I don't know why everyone trusts companies from other countries, most of the bad malware and viruses come from these same countries, go figure!! That's why I gave PC Matic a five star rating; Because it deserves it!"
"I do some youtube editing and some stop motion work. I had platinum 10 and it lacked a lot of things I needed to sway the illusion of stop motion animation (blur effects, cookie cutter). This does indeed have them, basic versions though which are actually a little touchy at times in terms of appearance, but overall its a bare bones version of a $500 software package in vegas pro, so you get what you pay for here. If you're keeping it basic, its great, but for advanced options its a little limited, but the quality is still good."
"Well, after a clean wipe of the harddrive and complete reinstall of Leopard, and then a fresh install of a brand new Office 2008 right out of the box, every single one of the applications crashes on startup and none of the suggestions in any of the forums online solve the problem.  So I'm going to have to give this an enormous thumbs down, worst program I've ever purchased.  When it won't even start up, you know it's bad."
"I purchased this item so that my GPS would be up to date. I travel a lot in other states, and there is nothing worse than being loss on the highway in a strange State."
It's Norton; what else can I say. Definitely cheaper purchasing here vs. direct from Norton though!
"The office Suite that I recieved and downloaded is nothing what I thought I was getting.  The box states ""An Affordable Alternative to Microsoft Office"". I thought I was getting something that would be similar to Microsft Word and Excel but instead it is Print Workshop 2010 with graphics for making cards, banners, etc. I will never order from Amazon again if they continue to let things be sold that are not accuratley depicted."
NOT SAFE !!!!  flagged by both windows 10 and REMOVED by Norton security
"I bought and used this Europe City Navigator from Garmin recently (in early jan 2009) during a trip to Nothern Spain and it was dissapointing for an SD Card that costs more than US$ 100....It didn't have enough detailed information on favorites and/or points of interest...
Finding restaurants that are supossed to be famous by Travel Review Magazines was not easy...and also very slow finding satellites when turning ON.
Definitively, not worth the money I paid for these maps.
Jose Manuel ...."
This version didn't find the previous years' personal info to import and save time.  It also wouldn't e-file my extension request which I simply did on the TurboTax website for free.  Don't bother buying this download to save a few bucks. Go direct to the TurboTax website and pay the extra money.  The web based version is way better and saves you so much time.  I have too many categories with the home business category to manually enter every year so I will be paying for the web based and this download was a complete waste of my money.
I just received my SnagIt software.  The box seal was slit opened and was just re-taped.  It has nothing to do with the software itself.  I love snagit.
"It has now been TOO many times that I have been convinced to buy a product from Intuit, and then only after buying, find out that the product does not do what is claimed by the manufacturer.  Several times I have found this true with QuickBooks Pro, and now most recently, TurboTAX.  Most of these problems seem to be related to the MAC platform, and I don't think they have anything to do with Apple or the Mac, rather Intuit's lack of care and support for the MAC community of users.  Watch out!

This product, ""for Windows and Mac"", does NOT ""create W-2 and 1099-MISC forms for your employees and contractors"" on a Mac.  Read fine print no. 4. ""Windows only"".

This product, ""works with Quickbooks"" does not import ""data from ....Quickbooks....to save you time"".  Again, the fine print (Turbo Tax website) is that it only imports from Quickbooks for Windows (2006 or higher).

I could go on about the myriad ways in which Intuit has left the Mac community out in the cold, but I won't, because most of my additional complaints are about the Quickbooks product.

If you have a Windows computer, don't pay too much attention to this review.  If you're on a MAC, abandon Intuit as soon as you find a better alternative.  My impression - Intuit STINKS on a Mac!"
Great as always.  I don't do the download but CD came and works great. Did my biz taxes and even tho I OWE!!!  Im please with the process.  I trust HR products every year for the past 4 yrs.  Good price too.  Even cheaper than HR Block Promos.
Parallels is a TRULY AWESOME PRODUCT for anyone that NEEDS TO RUN WINDOWS from Their MAC....THANK YOU FOR MAKING MY LIFE EASY :-)
I have not been able to use it since I have no user name or PW for it.  I would probably love it if I could use it!
I have been using QB windows for 15 years (and have loved it)and switched to QB Mac (thinking I was improving) but the little quirks are driving me nuts!  The BIGGEST problem is the program isn't smart enough to know what day it is. If you leave the program open over night it never changes the default date which causes all kinds of problems with inventory and billing.  I could go on and on but most people won't read beyond this.
I've used quickbooks for over 10 years for three different businesses. It's easy to pick up and use and yet has the capacity to grow and provide a lot of information as you need it. I've used it for my own jewelry / art business and now use it for the construction company I work for.
"I used Taxcut for 3 years.  It is very easy to use, just type in the information computer asks and software does all the jobs.  I usually submitted the tax form by regular mail to save some money.
The price in Amazon for this product is the cheapest and they are reliable for shipping and custom service."
"Amazing and easy to use. Came a day early and was just what I wanted. Records and has a step by step show how of recording and editing. Love it and definitely recommend for anyone wanting to make montages or anything video games :)

(I also heard these don't work with macs, I don't have one so I'm not 100% sure. If you have a mac, look into that before ordering.)"
I've used this product a few time and it works great. Thank  you.
"Stay away from Norton Antispam.  It looks and acts good to start but it degrades to the point that you will have to remove it from your system to keep the computer working.
I purchased and installed two IDs of Antispam, one for a win98se and one for a win2k.  Each has become very glitchy since installation several weeks ago.  Especially on the win98se.  From the outset there were slow operations, reboots and dumb things like the game freecell not being able to work.
Today I had to remove it from both and will seek but probably not get a refund from Symantec on both CDs.
The win98se copy of Outlook simply refused to function today.  It would lock up the entire machine.  ONLY when Antispam was removed from the system did Outlook function normally and the other slowed functions work normally.
The win2k computer developed different symptoms yesterday and today.  It developed ""Slow right click"" to the point that windows explorer barely functioned.  Immediately after removing Norton Antispam the slow right click went away.  As did other symptoms like slow boot.  That was after I had spent hours trying to reconfigure administrative functions in win2k to find out what the problem was.
It is possible that the automatic live update that Symantec offers introduced an update that made both computers become unusable on nearly the same day.  Do you think I could find help on their website or on the telephone?  Nothing!  NO help at all.
I am done with a desktop spam filter for Outlook on either win98se or win2k.  And I am especially done with Symantec and their poorly written software in the form of Norton Antispam.
Chris Samuels"
"The software loaded onto my system just fine but then would not log onto the Intuit servers for authentication. They tried to help but all their suggestions to include the setting on my system, it's security settings and the patches we downloaded failed to correct the problem. This was on a new Windows computer running Windows 8.1.
I should make it clear that this may be a case of one incident of bad software and the seller has offered a complete refund while Intuit at least tried to resolve the issue. I am considering getting a different copy of the software to see if this is just a case of a bad copy.

Final update: It was not just a bad copy. I bought the same software from a different source with the same lack of results. The folks at the Intuit service center tried but the software simply would not function. Currently waiting for my refund from Intuit for the second copy I bought."
"I have been using Norton Internet security 2014 now for four months and so far at this time I have had good results. Norton Internet security has blocked out numerous malicious attacks which may have been fatal to my operating system. The software completely runs on its own without having to ask you to check for updates do maintenance etc. I have ran several Internet securities software, and whether it be a paid for version or free trial Norton Internet security has for me operated hands down much better than the others I have used."
Works awesome just like all my other Kindle apps!
I have used TurboTax several years now and have never had any problems with the software.  Will purchase again next year.
I have used AVG for years & love it. I feel I am fully protected both on my computer as well as my smartphone. The PC TuneUp is outstanding!
just what I needed
I think it works great
As soon as I loaded it I had nothing but problems and had to flatten my computer and reload windows.
"This was given to my son who is going to be living in China this summer and presently knows no Chinese.  He's worked hard with this program and at least appears to be getting the tonal quality correct which is key in this language.  A microphone is a must with this program.  Only wish it focused on certain key words other than phrases that would never be used, like ""an old man driving a car""."
Very nice. It's free.
great relaxing screensaver.  makes you think of a hammock on a nice summer day...
"For years I have used Norton. Continually had lock up problems with my computer, continually got Malware, spam, and viruses. This solved all those problems. An ALL-IN-ONE program, It is SET IT AND FORGET IT. You schedule times for scans, virus removals, etc. and you are set. It works in the background so, there is no constant interuption of your work and it does not bog down your computer when it is running. The virus scan is fast and thorough. I would recommend it to anyone, especially those running VISTA. It also includes backup for your system, you can back up to DVD or a central location, and option for signing up for online backup. It is great. Fantastic price. Less than a 1/3 of other products and offers more."
"IMO, this is the best home design product available in its price range. It has a large library of items built in, and the 3D drawings look very good."
still evaluating this software. I am not quite sure if I will keep it or revert to previous Norton which was much smoother and remembered all passwoirds.
"When I was a kid, ""Land of the Lost"" was one of my favorite shows. The idea of falling through a hidden portal into a world full of dinosaurs and monsters was a fantasy brought to life every week. I was looking forward to seeing a new version of the original idea brought to life with better writing and special effects. That's not what we got with this movie at all.

The story revolves around Will Farrell as an egotistical archaeologist Rick Marshall, mocked for his theories of using time travel to study dinosaurs. When fellow archaeologist Holly (Anna Friel) shows him proof his time travel machine works, Marshall leads her on a hunt for a portal, which inexplicably leads them to a tourist trap run by Danny McBride. Farrell's machine takes them through a river into the Land of the Lost. They have to find a way back home while avoiding dinosaurs, the reptilian Sleestaks, and other monsters. All the basic elements are there, but it's very different from the original show.

The big problem is that the movie has entirely the wrong tone. I guess the writers couldn't figure out if they wanted to appeal to young viewers who would be excited by dinosaurs and monsters or older viewers who remembered the TV show. They ultimately went in both directions at once, which doesn't work. It's too raunchy for kids, but too goofy for adults.

I was planning to show this movie to my kids, but I'm glad I watched it first. I couldn't believe where this movie went. In one early scene, the characters are in a gift shop, and they focus on a rack of mugs shaped like women's naked breasts. In case we didn't notice it, one of the characters picks one up and talks about it. At that point, any chance of my kids seeing this movie went out the window. There are also multiple references to sex with the ape-sidekick Chaka grabbing Friel's breasts. In another scene, Chaka makes hip thrusts to simulate sex. There's also a lot of profanity. So it's definitely not a movie for young kids.

At the same time, it's too silly for adults to enjoy. There's a lot of green-screen and big fake trees that give the movie an unrealistic feel, and the dinosaurs behave in ways that are either too human or too dog-like to take seriously. The comedy is also the literal definition of ""toilet humor."" I lost count of how many times the movie referenced urine and feces. I don't think most of the grown ups who remember this show would be giggling at dinosaur pee and poop jokes. That means it's not really a movie for adults, either.

That leaves a movie which no one will be happy with. If I had been the studio, I would have told them to to go back and either make it more realistic to become a more grownup movie or cut the dirty jokes and make it a movie for kids.

I can sum up the other problem with this movie in two words: Will Farrell. I think they tried to make this movie into ""Anchorman in the Jungle"" instead of ""Land of the Lost."" Most of the movie is about setting up situations where Farrell can be humiliated or scared or hurt, and seeing him running around in ""funny"" ways. I think Will Farrell can be brilliant, but there has to be something for him to work with. This movie throws stuff at him to do that they think will be funny, but often isn't. The movie felt more like a series of connected sketches than a coherent story. Cut to the sketch where Will Farrell covers himself in dinosaur urine. Here's the sketch where Will Farrell has to dance across a volcano to songs from ""A Chorus Line."" He does the best he can, but he can't save the movie on his own.

This movie was so disappointing. It had a great cast, and a great premise, and completely wasted them."
"The lecturer is a little dry, but has great graphics."
"So far the system is having lots of crashes with Microsoft Word edition 2013. I am a university student who needs a software that is more reliable. Also Microsoft windows 10 is slower to start when the computer is turned on. when the system is not crashing, writing a academic paper is much efficient until Microsoft and Dragon freezes up and I have to reboot the computer to continue. I will contact customer service and update my rating soon.

Updated review:
after I contacted Amazon customer service I was redirected to a specialist in software installation. Although the Dragon system is not refundable by Amazon, I was content with the customer service that I received. I have uninstalled and installed the software again. The system seems to be working much better. I'm able to dictate an academic paper without having to reboot the computer constantly to get the software unfrozen. Personally the system seems to be working great specially since English is not my native language and attend to have difficulties in writing a academic paper and focusing in my spelling. The Dragon NaturallySpeaking home 13.0 is so far was well worth the money. I also bought a headset to cancel noise which I believe is working quite well and besides my accent the dictation is quiet consistent and correct."
I downloaded Amazon Music for Mac last year and it has worked flawlessly. I read all of the bad reviews and was a bit afraid to download. Everything was easy. None of the seemingly horror stories from others. Perhaps those that had issues should try again. I love Amazon Music and use it all the time. I purchase most of my music from Amazon now and have pretty much given up on iTunes.
"It's improved a bit over the last couple of versions, but still doesn't come close to an actual Kindle reading experience."
Crashes and everytime quicken forces me to upgrade they try to get me to buy the newer version 2 months later after I buy
I am still finding new applications on Quicken 2014.  I have had a problem with my last 2 Quickens that could not be resolved.  2014 has resolved this problem.
"My experience with the webroot package began about 6 months ago when Norton began hanging (failing to finish its scans) on a Windows XP and a Windows Vista computer. I first installed the webroot product on the Windows XP machine and noticed that it always took between 5 - 10 minutes to boot the software up. After several discussions with webroot personnel, I came to the conclusion that this software simply must have a minimum of 1 Gb memory to work properly (the XP machine only had 512K). After upgrading the system memory, there were no further problems. The webroot software worked fine on the Vista machines from the start because they already had sufficient memory.

What you get for your trouble is a very powerful antivirus + anti-spyware combination that is much more adept at finding and eliminating threats than Norton ever was. It is also the first package I've used that effectively stops homepage highjacking, even from the dreaded msn and runonce issues. Just specify the homepage you want in the antivirus program, then in your web browser, reboot, and the problem is gone.

The key here is that you must have 1 Gb of memory for this software to work properly, so if you don't have a full gig or you don't know how much you have, go to [...] where you can scan your computer to see what you have and buy additional memory if needed.

I have now installed this software on 7 computers (3 Vista, 4 XP) and it works great every time. All 4 XP machines required memory upgrades."
Awesome and easy!
"I converted from a PC to a iMac and was looking for a program similar to Quicken.  This program does not download data from a financial institution, in my case Chase without additional fees.  Disappointing . . ."
I love it....
"This program combines anti-virus protection with a firewall, anti-spam and spyware protection
It is a great program, but it will not load properly if you previously used Norton Anti-Virus or Internet Security.
The normal uninstall process will not remove all Symantec files from your computer (this has been a serious problem with Symantec from the beginning). In the case of Norton Anti-Virus and Norton Internet Security, the remaining files will conflict with Trend Micro's products. To remove them, go to Symantec's website and download a file named ""RnisUPG.exe"". Run it, and it will remove the offending files."
"Relatively easy to use, but there is a learning curve if you are new to editing."
Reliable software.  The tool that helps you price any charity donated items is useful and helps document the value of things.  You can still handle capital gains with this version -- you don't need Premier.
"QuickBooks Online Plus helped get my new compost service up and running- fast! With just a little clicking around, I could set-up my customer accounts and get my invoices created in a flash. The only shortcoming I've found is that the notes I enter in the Mobile app don't get integrated into the main record; so far it's a one-way street. With some work on the Mobile features this will be a 5 star program."
"If you've used Turbo Tax before you know what you're getting in to. The software walks you through every scenario possible even though many don't pertain to me. You can just skip right through those. I ordered the download, installed, and nearly finished the whole thing in one hour. It also help me find a large deduction that I would have easily missed had I done it on my own. One year I decided to use Tax Cut and that was a mistake. It was confusing and it ended up being the smallest refund I ever received. Stick with Turbo Tax."
Skips parts of pages.  Very hard to navigate.  No directions.
"This game provides variety of fun math games from addition , subtraction, which number is missing and counting. Its great for kids under 7. Gets them to think and improve in math skills while fun looking at unique graphics"
"Horrible customer service. Since you have to register your subscription with their cloud service manager, I ran into problems with my subscription populating properly. I tried emailing them but they ignored my email and told me to consult their FAQ. I tried calling and was on hold for 10 minutes before I gave up."
Needed the newest version to use with the Yosemite operating system on my new iMac. Works fine.
"This program is great, it will teach typing, but I will like to see more practice exercises before changing lessons."
Order the Turbo Tax software every year.  I have always found it easy to navigate and so much better than doing it the old fashioned way of wading through various forms and publications and hope you do it correctly.
"Great way to protect my iPad. Now I can stuff it in my purse, take it to the grocery store, anything I need without fear of damaging it. Don't know if it's real leather, but don't care."
"So far, I haven't had any problems with my purchase, it arrived on time and the product case was in perfect condition.  This was my first purchase with Amazon, and it was worth every penny.  Look forward to using them again!"
"To teach myself how to use Sage 50, I relied online tutorials (video and text) for when I got stuck; Youtube has a wealth of intro/beginner/intermediate ones for helping setup and run the program. With an afternoon's focus, I got most of the basic functions implemented and felt comfortable using the software.

This software is really ideal for a small business or company that needs reliable accounting software, but does not (yet) need an actual accountant or financial person to keep tabs on things. I run a very small business out of my home and occasionally have a friend or partner assist me with the goings-on, and Sage 50 definitely offers the functionality I needed: invoices and statements (looked great, slick, and professionally done), balancing, etc. Premium is more than adequate for a small (<10?) employee business.

A major drawback is taht it's a subscription software, meaning it has planned obsolescence and will require renewal in a year. I'm not sure if I would stick with this (given I received a free copy to review) given its cost, but I'll see how it goes for a year with my small business before deciding to renew/continue. The other major direct competitor is QuickBooks, whose software packages are equally expensive."
Works just fine and my cat loves it.
"I am very satisfied with my purchase of Windows professional 2007. It came wrapped brand new, and loaded correctly. Department stores want 3 times what i paid! Took a long time to get through the mail though."
Meets expectations
It no longer is compatible to my computer! I could not download it to my Apple!!!
Great software
I want another
Good security program coverage.
Seemed like a lot of work went into developing this software.
"I have been really happy with FileCenter in the past, and was really excited to purchase version 9 with the new features that were available. I have used a few other document management solutions in the past and they were either very difficult to use or very expensive.

With the new features of version 9, I can now use barcodes along with my page separators to scan documents to my system which makes us much more efficient in the office.

I would highly recommend purchasing the software if you are looking for a way to save money by eliminating the need to look for paper documents in your office. You will see that your office becomes much more efficient going forward."
"placed my order for Crack the NBDE in order to become acquainted with the format of the National Board Dental Examination.  I received an email from them with my login information which allowed me to download the software.  I guess if you place the order on their website directly, you can immediately download the software without waiting.  This program has helped me simulate and test-drive the National Board Dental Examination so that I can expect no surprises on my test day.  Indeed, the questions are challenging, but I rather be over-prepared than under-prepared or go into the test with a false sense of security.  After each test, I was very impressed by the in-depth analysis which was conducted pointing out how much time I spent per question, how many times I changed my answer as well as topics in which I was strong and weak in.  This is helping me focus and hone in on those areas.  By complementing this with other preparation aids and doing released exams, I hope that collectively, this will help me land a higher score on the NBDE.  I must add that customer service has been very accommodating, professional and courteous too.  They really do stand behind their product.  Again, I highly recommend this program to anyone preparing for this exam."
"Don't go out and purchase Quark for 800 dollars.  This program does everything and more than Quark.  I create a Digest for my school with it.  It is fantastic.  I can
do everything with this program that I could do with Quark and in some cases it is easier.  I can import photographs masked in Photoshop and bring them in and they are transparent, I can wrap text with the wrap tool, make pdf's, etc........Worth every penny (all 40 dollars).  Highly recommend."
"Admittedly, I don't have a large music collection like the negative reviewers seem to, however for my personal collection (around 500 songs/12 albums) this software is superb and allows me to stream my collection seamlessly. The quality of the music is spot on when listening through my Audio-Technica ATH-M50 (also recommended!) headphones too.

I should add that my entire, though small, collection has all been purchased using Amazon's own MP3 download service. I have found this service to be the cheapest place to purchase music in most cases so far. I cannot offer feedback/advice for those with large collections but as I said, the software works great with a small collection. As my own collection expands I will be sure to monitor the performance of the Cloud Player."
I like it a lot. There are enough keys with this package to protect all my devices. It was a very good price too.
Love it!!!
"I'm not going to speak to the product itself (although I prefer earlier versions of Word). I want to say that, for me, purchasing, downloading and installing were not difficult. I did use the library's wifi, and even on that fast connection, it took somewhere around an hour, I think, so don't expect it to go quickly. You do have to either already have, or acquire during the process, a Microsoft account. If you already have that, it's just following the directions and being patient. If I encounter any of the mentioned issues with the program ceasing to work properly after a certain amount of time, I will edit this comment."
Delivered as promised.
"I want my Norton 360 back!  This is basically junk. It doesn't scan your hard drive, it only scans files that are downloaded from the internet. Any anti-virus software can do that, including the FREE Windows Defender. Norton 360 scanned, got rid of old cookies, did performance cleanup, etc., this version does nothing - AND you have to turn it on manually!  If I forget to launch it, the Windows ""unprotected"" message blinks and I have to manually click on it to turn it on. I've had Norton since my first Apple II and this will be the last version I purchase."
"I did not get this from Amazon. I bought it from Corel a few years ago. It is simply Corel-branded version of a Global Graphics product (they wrote the interpreter for the once popular Harlequin RIP for film imagesetters (I don;t know about today's direct to plate stuff<G>)

I normally use it for non-reproduction (i.e. ""lithographic production or ""for printing on a press"") purposes.

I produce a 126 page photo directory of an association once each year. For the last 27 years I had printed from the authoring application (Ventura Publisher) to a Postscript file then having Acrobnat Distiller v8 distill that into a PDF file which was then presented to the service bureau for output.

This year I used this Corel PDF Fusion app. And the plates that came back were unusable. The halftones were far too contrasty (meaning they went full black much too soon and were too light at that end of the scale.)

I compared the plates to the actual tiff images in Photoshop that I have been using for several years with excellent results. The plates were bad, and the only different element was PDF Fusion instead of using Distiller. I remade the files and the differences in the PDFs were obvious. I'll have to eat the cost of 13 plates, several hundred dollars, because PDF Fusion Didn't produce PDFs that were the same as the Gold Standard Distiller.

PDF Fusion is fine for creating casual PDFS. But NOT for creating PDFs intended for professional reproduction UNLESS you have calibrated your Photoshop settings to tyhe real world output using this product.

I give it 2 stars because it is usable in casual situations."
I've been using Norton for years however I didn't realize this wasn't the 360 equivalent as the new titles for level of security were a little confusing. This software still gets the job done and has come down in price so is now a better buy than ever.
I'm very satisfied with this product. It was easy to setup and use without too much study. I like the fact that profiles can be setup for more than one person.
"I should have read other readers' comments.  I had hoped for new computer players and dialogue, as well as games.  There were a few new games & puzzles, but the players & dialogue were the same.  There was a very old card game called, ""Anyone for Cards.""  Wish I could get a current application for that, but it's probably gone the way of the dinosauers, like Marvin.  :-)  I did keep the newer version, and I do enjoy playing the Hoyle Board games."
All the great art work I hoped for and easy to use.
Everything was installed although I had to reformat my drive. All is well now.
"There may be 2000 sound effects on this disc, but unless you have time to listen and catalog each one, it will be difficult to use.  Effects are divided into several file folders but individual effects are identified by number only.  If you have a ton of time on your hands, you can build your own index, but you will probably want to use this disc as a frisbee long before you get your index finished."
could not read much of it
Ver y good
"Took course to completing level one prior to trip to Germany.  I was so concern that i did not learn enough of the language to understand signs, and communicate with the people.  I was surprise as to how much I was able to grasp. What made it so nice is the places we visited in Germany, the people were so friendly and helpful it made it a very enjoyable trip."
Have had no problems whatsoever!
It does seem to have some of the problems present from time immemorial in the original version.  On the other hand I do not have the latest equipment either.
I bought this for my daughter.  She is an animation student.  She has used the software at school and needs it for future products.  She loves the software but was surprised when she had to submit a photo of her student i.d. to get an unlock code to download the software.  There should be another way of submitting proof you are a student.  Sending photos of i.d.s could lead to identity theft.
"Mayo Clinic Family Pharmacist is so old it does not contain aspirn.  This was last updataed in 1995. do not waste your money

I can not believe Amazon would allow such an out of date item be sold."
I love this product. I have bought a new computer and I am contemplating actually owning this product. It is my Answer to office with out buying office.
"Worked as it should, best price around."
"I have used TurboTax for many years and have allways found it very complete in walking through all the possibilities. I have not tried other S/W packages, so I can't rate TurboTax against them. However, like all S/W packages, they are only as good as what you ""feed"" them.
For 2013, Intuit has added a ""come-on"" to get you to spend some of your refund on an Amazon card. My advise, don't do it. You end up supplying a lot of information to a third party bank. Intuit should stick  to doing taxes and stop trying to sell other ""stuff""."
"After I installed it on one of my GPS units, I found I already had one stored in the pocket of the case!  Stupid me!  I'm sure glad I only paid $20 for this used one, rather than $100 that Garmin wants for a new one.  Now I have a set of maps for both my GPS units--one for each hand.  LOL."
Installation on my computer was simple. A friend bought it for me for my 18th birthday and I love it. It's great for younger kids and even adults!
It did basically what I wanted but find it a little unclear in what it can do and not do.
great price
"This is a review of Office Suite 2006 ... years ago, I purchased this product from a box store (whose name I will not mention) for about $10. It is no longer offered in stores. It offers a word processor that works with Windows most Windows 2003 files. It probably doesn't work well with Windows Office 2007 or Windows Office 2010. It is after all a $10 product (or less).

It is easy to install, and so a very good, basic job for word processing. Which has been our primary use. Without a doubt Word is a much better product. We have also tried the free Open Office (from Sun, which is now owned by Oracle). Open Office is large, and it's word processor while compatible wasn't great or easy to use. The office 2006 suite is very good for very basic word processing needs (kids doing homework, book reports, writing a business letter or resume). Embedding pictures is easy. Cross linking spread sheets, not so easy, I haven't been able to embed dynamic graphs from a spreadsheet to my Office Suite 2006 word processor.

If you are looking for an inexpensive, relatively safe, alternative to $100 for Microsoft Office, this may do. It probably isn't suitable for college level work if that work involves graphs or embedding more than basic .jpg pictures.

We have used the paint program, which is more advanced than the default Microsoft paint that comes with various versions of Windows. It won't handle overlays, won't auto outline, won't allow selection of new backgrounds, basically it isn't Photoshop. If you need to just cut and paste, crop, remove red eye, emboss, change format from one of the many supported types to another, this will work well. Advanced features really aren't included. It's a basic product, but is more capable than the Open Office draw offer from Oracle.

I'm uncertain about licensing, it seems to install on any PC with the same code. I've seen you tube videos offering a code, it is possible there is only one code for all I know.

This is a small, fast, basic suite, for non-advanced users who have basic needs. So far, it has been great for my family. This is a 32 bit Windows program, but works well on any version of XP, Vista or Windows 7 we have tried it on, 32 or 64 bit."
"I bought X4 thinking it would be better than X3. Wrong. X4 is much harder to get several pictures on at the same time. I customised the menu to make it work but now I have to click the ""Cascade Windows"" icon in order to see all of the images I need on one window. Then when the images come up they are all bigger than normal with lots of black boarder on each side of the image. That makes me have to click the Zoom tool and change the size to get rid of the black boarders:-(
Go with X3 until they get a better version!"
This is too involved and technical for a regular person to use.  Wish I hadn't spent the $
I upgraded because the new Publisher program was so good.  I can't find any real benefits in upgrading.  Just wasted money and are they proud of this product.  Only good for computer which is wrong since so many of us use many different devices now.
"TurboTax [Premier] is a wonderfully easy product to use for just about everyone except the current US Secretary of the Treasury, who also heads the IRS. Lots of help available within the program itself in addition to the TurboTax Online Community of users who offer friendly and useful advise. At nearly $70 just for the downloadable version it's a very expensive program that is useful only once for a specific tax year."
"Bought for wife, she enjoys it very much"
product met my expectations.
Product would not install in system using WINDOWS 10.  Received errors indicating software that was clearly on the disk could not be found for installation.
"Corel PaintShop Pro X7: What I didn't like; it took forever to install and register. I was able to install two other programs in less time than it took to install and register this program. I'm still not sure it actually did register. I entered my email address and it went to a white screen suggesting it was registering, but that was it. It took about 5 minutes to install. The first time I tried to open it, it wouldn't open. I got a blank dialog box and after several minutes I closed that and tried again. Finally it did open.
Once I did get everything working I tried to see the so called video tutorials. It took me online and there were tutorials on how to use my camera to take better pictures, but anything to do with learning this program took me to places where I could purchase stuff, online lessons or additional filters.
It was easy enough to figure out without the lessons and there is an online manual that can be downloaded. I like that you can use the simple, one step fix and it will evaluate your photo and adjust it for you. You can also use layers, like you can with Adobe, to do more professional photo editing. It has a full array of features to do just about anything you can think of. The ability to do all sorts of fancy text editing is really fun. You can put your photo onto text, it's fun. It also have a share button that lets you upload your photo to social media like FB and Google +
I installed the program on a windows 7 laptop. I like that it takes up less space than some of the other full feature photo editing programs. I was able to access photos on my other computers via the open and selecting my network, no hesitation or problem. I have had issues with other similar programs not being able to get onto my other computers.
After the frustration of installation, it is a fun, easy to use, full featured photo editing program. I like Corel. I find that I've been able to do things with this program that I can't figure out how to do with adobe."
Has worked well so far with info I need.
"I purchased this Bible many years ago in Barnes and Noble and I must say, the paper is not good quality at all. Of course the content is infallible, but you have to be very careful when turning pages, they tear easily. Not sure why a publisher would use cheap paper for re-print of the Bible"
Too expensive. No update available for purchased map.
Tried to load it onto my laptop with windows 7 on it but it would not load using the disk.  Finally had to call intuit and have them load it remotely.  The disk kept saying that the number I got with the package was not a valid license number.
This did not function up to my expectations.
"This game does not need anymore reviews, but I had to say what a great game and so much variety. You choose between 4 trucks and each has many games. Do not buy another tonka game this is the only really good one. I bought most of them! I even played the restaurant game it was very funny to try to get all the orders with out getting some food on the floor!!"
This is a great product.  I love how easy it is to use.  The new ribbon is awesome.  But if you have other products that is older like front page 2003 you will need to remove it and then re install it for it to work.
"About a week after I installed it, my computer was devastated with a virus."
"Unfortunately, a frustrating waste of time. The bugs are numerous: wall dimensions change unexpectedly, it is difficult to place and move walls, floorspace is calculated in unexplainable ways, typing in dimensions often do not ""take"" or do take but incorrectly (20.00"" becomes 2000.00 inches, etc.), changing a texture on a floor gets applied to a door, the 3D view is very limited in that you cannot tilt the camera POV (you can only move around at a predetermined height). You cannont generate elevation views of rooms (much less modify your plans from an elevation view). The list goes on and I'm sure I've only scratched the surface in the few days I've worked with this dog. I have managed to generate a thumbnail quality plan that communicates more or less what I have in mind, but it is hardly of the quality that you would want to really pre-visualize a $250K construction project. Of course, even that doesn't print well.

I'm hoping I can return this thing and find something that really works."
Good specially the ever changing of the IOS. SHOUD HAVENOT UPGRADED CL
"not the more to say. as expected
download took about 15-20 min. and then install
is is what it is"
Great software for making your own videos from movies or stills. I bought this as a gift for my daughter. She loves it and uses it all the time. Has great features and I got it for a great price.
"The video capture is amazing. The screen capture, edit and mark up option is useful and adds fun. Easy to use. Great introduction video tutorials get you up and running in no time."
I switched from Norton yrs ago and run 6 licences annually.  No viruses and I have NEVER had a problem uninstalling if necessary.  Its less intrusive than others and I was even UNABLE to uninstall Macafee from a Dell PC I purchased without bluescreen which by my definition IS A VIRUS.  Found tons of similar complaints on Macafee and norton.
"I was looking for a simple program for editing and and was surprised at the features packed in this inexpensive program. Have had it for a year and have edited 100's of photos using cropping, adding text,adjusting color, sharpness, and more. Is it for the pro photographer? No, but you can't beat it for the every day person needing to make revisions to their photos. And for the money you won't be dissapointed."
"This is a great product. I recently bought this for my kids (twins - 3years and 6 months) and they love it. Not only has ot helped them to develop preschool skills but they learnt how to use the keyboard and mouse. The software is well layed out so the kids could easily navigate through the program. Now I only need to get the porgram started. The kids know how to navigate from there onwards.
This is a must buy for all who want to get their kids develop computer skills early whilst learning."
"This app is horridly slow.  I used a stopwatch to track the amount of time it took to launch: 5 minutes and 23 seconds!  So after 5 full minutes of waiting now I can use the app??  No no!  Now we must keep waiting because as soon as the app ""launches"" it must ""RESTORE YOUR LOCAL PLAYLISTS...""  I have 3 small playlists.  It took the app 12 FREAKING minutes to ""restore"" 3 playlists with no more than 10-20 songs each.

That's insane Amazon.  Get your act together."
I was forced to change from Turbo Tax because of new system requirements and was happily surprised by the ease of use and the clarity of this product.

"Not the answer to DVD coping I had hoped for. Making backups is ify at best. You will spend a lot of time running through the process only to have it fail at the end, with no clear explanation of why.
Duel layer DVDs seem to be a problem for 123 Copy, as I am seeing a failure rate over 50% for copies I have tried to make. There has to be a better solution out there. I just hope I find it before one of my kids forgets to put a DVD back in its case."
"I bought this software, and it worked for a while. However when I upgraded to Linux EXT3 file-system it messed up the software. It would claim there was an error on the drive and would CORRUPT my linux partition! So NOT RECOMMENEDED IF YOU HAVE LINUX, as it only supports the EXT2 file-system.
However there customer-support is excellent! Called there customer support number and they set me up with a refund, so thats excellent! This is why I gave it four stars - for the company not the product."
I buy TurboTax every year.  This is the first time I bought it and downloaded it. No issues with the download.  It works the same as purchasing the disc.
"Smooth, easy, very thorough.  Purchasing, downloading and use were so easy we had no reason to contact Turbo Tax customer service."
I use this product to make full system backups of my main operating system drive. Restores the operating system and all your programs.  I backup once a month or after installation of any programs. Maybe I'm one of the lucky ones. It works for me. I've already used it after a complete meltdown of my main drive. I simply boot using the Norton install disk. I backup to an external 1TB Toshiba drive. I've even copied (cloned)my main drive and swapped them to see if it worked. I'm surprised that so many have problems. I'm running Windows 7 professional.
"I've used PowerDirector since Powerdirector 10.  I had to buy the latest version because cyberlink stopped updating 10.  The latest Nvidia drivers were no longer compatible with some of the basic features of 10, thus causing it to take FOREVER to render a video.  12 runs as expected, like a charm.  I love the ease of use and features of this program."
I installed this software via download on an HP desktop which immediately began acting very strangely. So I erased the software and got a refund for my download purchase. Then I read someplace that the program was not recommended for use on certain HP machines so I decided to give Kaspersky another chance on a Toshiba laptop. This time I bought a disc instead of a download. So far this time Kaspersky has lived up to its rave reviews. Very satisfied.
I love the app. What's to say
"Five Stars!!! McAfee VirusScan Plus is an outstanding product and an oustanding value. I was previously using Norton 360 Version 2.0 and it was an absolute dog, slowing my computer to a standstill. But this McAfee is just the opposite. Excellent virus protection, easy installation, McAfee SiteAdvisor, easy computer scans, and NO slowing of my computer. My computer is safe and I'm not pulling my hair out!"
Cant figure out how to use it.
As Expected
A good program for free use.
"Before Parallels 9, Parallels was glitchy from the beginning, but it's attempting a complex task and I needed it, in spite of occasional frustration.  Parallels 9 is the first version that has been issue free. In spite of issues with previous versions, I've been able to recover crashed windows machines or virtual machines in 2 hours using parallels.  My main problem with parallels has been unreliable tools installation.  A few months ago, I found my virtual machine corrupted and parallels support (using 7 at the time) could not help me fix it.  The virtual machine is a mirror of a Dell laptop.  I work interchangeably between it  and a virtual machine on a 27 inch iMac using sync software on the windows side to keep the machines interchangeable.

I was frustrated, but decided to give Parallels 9 a try before giving up and going to another software.  I bought and downloaded Parallels 9 and set it to create a virtual machine from the Dell which was on the network.

It cranked away for 3 hours untouched and when the virtual machine started, It was a complete, identical copy of the Windows 7 machine.  Tools installed flawlessly (and automatically).

I was so pleased with that success and in the intervening months, I've never had to touch Parallels, I just run the virtual machine.  Currently running in Mavericks on the iMac."
"I have to say that this game was too short in game play, otherwise it was still fun to play. I liked the idea of ""driving her car"" and going from one building to another instead of just staying at one place. The graffics were very good. The puzzles could have been a little harder. Overall, I still liked playing this game. I'm a big fan of the ND games."
"I've worked with Microsoft Office for pretty much as long as it has existed, and now that I am retired it is a must have for my home computer, too!  Purchasing the software through Amazon was fast and easy - and if I ever need to re-download it, I just go to my ""library"" on Amazon. I am very pleased with my purchase!"
a lot more complex and difficult not as plyer friendly but if you love the series it's a must own.
"Note: I downloaded this piece of uselessness directly from the Wondershare website. My laptop's HD is now 59mb richer for its uninstallation,)

As far as I could determine, this ""data recovery"" software recovers NOTHING you can't find for yourself, especially if you have a competent file-finding program like UltraFileSearch.

I bought it in hope of finding some 100 files I'd accidentally deleted from a camera card before transferring to my hard drive. Wondershare non-Recovery gave me a list of files that hadn't been deleted (they were in a different folder on the card). Otherwise, nada, nothing, nil.  I tried it on all my camera cards -- nothing. I tried every mode of recovery available -- nothing.  I then deleted a document file and a binary data file from my computer as a test. Yes, Wondershare found it. So did the Recycle Bin. So did UltraFileSearch when directed to search system, hidden etc. files -- in the recycle bin. Possibly plain old Windows 8 search would have found it if I'd cared to bother with it.

The trial version, if I remember (no certainty!) lets you use only a few of the ""modes"" of searching. It pulled up a handful of files on a camera card -- files I hadn't realized were still on the card because of an ambiguously named folder. Had I realized this I'd have known better tnan to spend my money.

Don't expect any help from Wondershare. When I uninstalled the program the usual ""help us improve, click on link to send feedback"" screen appeared in my browser. I clicked. This links to the ""support"" screen which adirects you to answer ""these 2 or 3 questions."" Evidently this refers to the three boxes below. One is for the user manual (which you have to buy). One is for ""technical"" and another for more general support questions. These two boxes simply pull up a list of possible issues of the most obvious kind. (I lost my product key. Can I fix a double charge for my download.) Yes, there is a box for other. I'd be very surprised if any ""feedback"" about the program went anywhere but straight to the Great Bit Box in the Sky and didn't bother.

Reviews suggest that persons who fouind this program useful hadn't tried other ways to find their lost or deleted files. Take this as a hint: try everything else you can think of first, and invest in a good 3rd party file finding utility."
too many issues with this one
Kaspersky has worked very well for me in the past. It does not take over the computer either like some of the other  Internet security software!!!
still very unclear as to how to use as it keeps saying not responding
"Purchased this for two older computers (one is desktop circa 2006 running XP and the other is a notebook (circa 2007) running Vista.  I had used Norton 360 on them and it was renewal time! Looked around and decided to pop for this as a suitable solution.  The download process went fairly well and the installation was a bit messy but I got it done on both of them.  Seems to work and that is ok with me.  Don't need fancy just need a bit of peace of mind.  Of course, nothing is perfect but one can hope (I lost my other Windows XP computer when a Trojan virus snuck past Norton 360 last year and trashed the software)."
"I've avoided Norton's security suites for years, based on their consistent ability to make the most powerful computer run like an old 486. I finally gave in to the flood of good reviews for Norton Internet Security 2009 and gave it a try... and I'm glad I did.

Resource use is minimal... and I mean *minimal*. When the program isn't performing an activity, it's almost invisible to system monitors. When it is active, it's still very low-key. I run it on 3 different systems (as allowed by the license), one of which is an old Celeron 800mhz. The old Celeron runs just as well as it did before Norton was installed. The freeware virus scanners I have used on that system (Avast!, AVG) really taxed the meager resources, making a huge performance hit.

The other thing I really like- it's quiet. Norton has decided (rightfully, in my opinion) that the average user doesn't really understand- or *want* to understand- computer security. It therefore makes it's own decisions about system configuration, including when & how to alert the user about virus's or firewall intrusion prevention. The experienced user can still dig into the settings and make the program 'loud', with lot's of messages and warnings. Me, I like the quiet. I kept a very close eye on my systems for the first month, to make sure I was satisfied with how Norton Internet Security 2009 was handling things. Then I forgot about it... the way this stuff is supposed to work.

All in all, Norton has a winner here. I hope they use the same design philosophy in the rest of their software suites."
"Gives you access only for a ""trial period"" then stops working.
Calls to LearnSmart customer service= frustration and no help.
Returned to Amazon for refund- thank you Amazon! and grudgingly forced to pay $60 direct to source of horrible product and service for access because it is mid-semester and homework is due!"
"I've been using Microsof Live OneCare for the last two years. The antivirus protection is great, and you can install the software in three computers... always paying the same price. I highly recommend this product."
"In less than 24 hours I received information on downloading the Crack the PCAT software and was immediately on my way to higher scores! After having used numerous other sources including Kaplan and Dr. Collins, I found this software to be the most helpful in preparing for the PCAT!"
"I bought this a Office Depot, but want to warn others about the product. Could not get vital features to work, such as individual slide duration. Arcsoft does not support it, although they apparently wrote it. Individual software is the current supplier of the software, has a really clunky site, and probably not worth the effort to navigate it to get technical support.

The very basic features seem to work, but I nave decided to pay a bit more, and get a more robust product."
As advertised!
Liked not having to buy the whole Office suite and it works great!
"As a full time college student with two hybrid classes, I definitely needed this with 700 word essays due weekly.  So happy was able to finally get this.  Yes it takes some practice but so what.  So does everything else.  I'm enjoying mine.  No problems whatsoever."
Just what we wanted
"Good program, however somewhat difficult to use."
EDIT 7/20/15 I AM SOO OVER APACHE ..YOU CAN SEE MY EARLIER REVIEW BELOW ..I ENCOUNTERED THE PROBLEM SUDDENLY THAT APACHE WOULD NOT CONVERT RICH TEXT TO PDF AND THE ONLY WAY I COULD DO IT WAS TO CLICK EXPORT TO PDF AS USUAL AND IT WOULD CREATE A FILE BUT NOT A PDF FILE THEN OPEN IT WITH MY ADOBE THEN CONVERT IT TO PDF ..THIS HAPPENED SUDDENLY..SO I GOT RID OF APACHE AND DOWNLOADED LIBREOFFICE AND HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH LIBRE SO SCREW APACHE VERSION ....EARLIER REVIEW FOLLOWS...WHEN I WAS SAVING  in rich text for data that will be used on multiple windows systems..the open office has TWICE lost data upon saving a file..this has happened when saving lengthy data which i have had to add to multiple times..it has not happened on shorter data files where i have not had to open and save the file multiple times.  and this was NOT User Error..the only user error involved here was my failure to check and see if backups were being logged by open office which they were not..i have now checked the box on that feature..when it happened again twice the data was Not in the backup folder...however i got an idea and its a simple one...every time i create a file with openoffice i simply click FILE upper left hand corner and then click export to pdf ...simple then i discard the openoffice file..done..the pdf files don't lose the data ..changed this review from one star to four stars after using openoffice in this way
"The version I actually have is called ( I believe) Professional Student. Obviously you must be a student to get this version of Offcie 2010, however, I insist that all versions of Microsoft Office 2010 are efficient and easy to use. The general layout, such as in a word document, is different, however, it is not a setback."
Great as always.
"This office suite is decent, never crashes, and is mostly intuitive. However, it is very lacking in features, and has a badly organized interface.

The good:
-reads MS Word files
-can export PDFs and Word files
-creates professional looking results
-Uncluttered interface

The bad:
-Some compatibility issues, make sure not to save in the useless .pages form
-Many features hard to find due to interface, many buttons serve several different functions
-Less features than MS Office, both PC and Mac versions
-Formatting is almost impossible
-Creating a theme/template seems not to work, at least in Keynote.
-Numbers is trumped by freeware I have right now.
-Takes a long time to start up"
"I have been running Quicken 2006... since 2006. The reviews for Quicken 2007 were so poor, I decided to wait until the price was low. It is 2012 and the price for a 5 year old, badly reviewed, never upgraded from 2007 product... is $129.99?

Why hasn't someone seen this market and jumped in? iBank is the closest I can find to Quicken 2006 and it is woefully lacking in so many features. I can't upgrade to Lion and bring Quicken 2006 along. So I am stuck with Leopard (not a bad deal for now) and Quicken 2006. I refuse to pay that much for an old, poor product.

Intuit still gives Mac the short end. They have recently pledged to remedy this, but I have heard that song before. Impress me, Intuit. I dare you."
I've been using Quicken Deluxe for a dozen years more and have simply upgraded to the latest version. I tend to do that every 2-3 years.
"I have downloaded this, and it STILL doesn't work!  I've tried over and over.  It loops into ""checking for updates"" and downloads a new update then tells me to either add a language level, when I click on that it tells me to insert a disc (I ordered the DOWNLOAD, not CD), the other options are to deactivate the product.  HELLLOOOO, this is faulty product.  I'd like my money back.

Furthermore, this is only good for 30 days, not at @ $250!  VERY POOR CHOICE - Do NOT BUY"
"Well, I finally upgraded from Quicken 2000.  I got 14 years out of the last software purchase.  The new one is taking a bit to get used to, but definately does a good job of keeping track of finances.  I like the ability to upload transactions from my bank and credit cards."
"10 years of using Turbo Tax no audits, no real hassles. Makes my life easy.  Their ""Next Year Tax Planner"" works perfectly.  The last 4 years I owed ZERO. My entire family uses Turbo Tax and are very happy with the results as well.

Have to add the price they charge for an additional state besides the free one included in the package is too high."
"Do NOT purchase this product.  I purchased it from Nero's web site, as a download.  I tried repeated (unsuccessful) installation attempts.  Each displayed the number ""1158"" and no other error text.  I then contacted Nero.

I responded immediately, and thoroughly, to their requests for information.  Finally, after more than a week without resolution, I reluctantly requested instructions for obtaining a refund.

Nero's exact response was as follows: ""Thank you for your e-mail.  Please be advised that we are unable to offer a refund, as defined by our terms of trade.  These terms were accepted with the purchase of Nero from our website [...].""

If you have doubts about this review, try searching ""Nero error 1158"" for countless similar complaints.

I previously owned Nero 7 Ultimate.  It was a great product.  However, the company has now slid so far downhill that they will not even provide a refund for a product that fails to install.

Following Nero's final response, I immediately contacted my credit card company.  They (American Express) were wonderfully helpful.  If you purchase the product anyhow, and encounter similar issues, I suggest you also contact your credit card company.

This is the first time I've seen a product that fails to install.  Further, the one or two complaints I've had, in the past 25 years, have been dealt with professionally.  Even companies consisting entirely of a single developer have responded more appropriately.  To see a company, like Nero, behave so unprofessionally is truly disappointing...and unexpected.

I truly hope they revise their approach towards customer service and return to their previous excellence."
"i love this software...download it to all my product for IT.Simple and easy to use. organized and even saves my spot and then tells me the farthest i have gone. that causes a bit of a problem, if you accidentally go forward, and lose your spot. however, that is a rare scenario and you really have to have a fumble storm to mess up that bad, so don't worry, the kindle by Amazon will take care of you every time!"
"I would highly recommend everyone not to buy this item. Your money will be in s... hole after one yr when it won't work on newer apple updates. These products are awsome but  rather than adding feature to newer products they force you to buy new product since last one does not work at all for key features ( an awesome way to sell products and make money  but worst in customer relations).

BUT IF YOU WANT TO SPEND MONEY $50 EVERY YR FOR THIS PRODUCT THEN THIS PRODUCT WILL DEFINITELY MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS.

I will advise that Parallel ppl should not greedy  and liars and show their actual price as $50  PER YEAR( we will keep it updated for your mac updates ) and let everyone decide if they want this product or not. In the end I feel cheated"
"I bought my first copy of Paint Shop Pro back with version 6.  I upgraded to 9, skipping a couple of generations.  My last purchase was PSP Photo X2.  Now I get to talk about Paint Shop Photo Pro X3 (v13).  Paint Shop programs have gained fans over the years due to the full featured value of generally less than $100 for entry.  Similar Apple and Adobe programs tend to cost much more for a similar feature set.

It is difficult to provide the kind of comprehensive review of products like this for a couple of reasons.  One, and most importantly, I do not typically use the full features of programs like this.  Most users, especially those that have never used a program like this, buy these programs to look at and fix photos.  Two, I do not have the time to spend looking at every feature of a program like this.  Three, there is no matching those professional reviewers and graphic designers that do have that kind of time or use programs like this for so many other features. What I can do is provide why I have liked PSP over the years, and compare it to another tool that I also use... Adobe Lightroom.

What I use Paint Shop programs for:  browsing files of photos and bringing them up for review or fixing.  I am an avid photographer, but also love looking at photo collection sites like Flickr.  File folders often are budging with the photos I like to review in more detail.

The browse function has always been strength of PSP.  It is a nice intuitive interface, with the ability to easily change the size of the thumbnails, and quickly add them to your workspace to review and modify.  Prior versions were slightly different in the way the entire interface was implemented.  The experience between browsing and fixing was a bit more segmented; it lacked a feature that another program defined - workflow.

Lightroom, a true king of ""workflow"", was one of the first PC programs to optimize workflow.  That workflow is how you move from taking a picture and quickly choosing how much work and modification you may want to put into fixing it. Non destructive photo changes allow you to always go back to your originals.  Truly, Lightroom is really super at that.  Even for non-users, they can pick up how a professional photographer might want to work.  Unfortunately, Lightroom is like a BMW.  It can do just about anything, but sometimes you don't need or want all that power or tweak ability.  All of those details can be overwhelming to some users.  Plus, there is a cost of entry.  About $285 right now for the full version. I love Lightroom when I really want delve into a project.  When I just want to look at photos as a group I find myself using Paint Shop.

With workflow, Paint Shop Photo Pro X3, is an improvement over all other prior versions, including X2.  Why?  It is simple--without making X3 look like Lightroom, X3 has made the workflow intuitive without being overly so.  Sure you can reconfigure your workspaces, and the features they contain if you want, but right out of the box, things work in a familiar fashion.  X3 has put some key features, the features I use the most - the ""Organizer"", ""Express Lab"" and ""Full Editor"" in the top right hand corner.  I can open a full view thumbnail view of the folder I want to look at, reorder it (personally, by date taken), and easily open that photo in the workspace to then see what I can do in Express Lab or Full Editor.  Express Lab brings back those one step or ""Smart Photo"" fixes that are most common.  Everything works like before, and the workflow is more integrated.

The normal cropping, magnification, and straighten tools are all where they have been in the past, and as before you can add or remove anything you do not want hanging out.

Editing functions, especially contrast and color control, seem to be clean and not introduce an undue amount of processing noise.  Anytime you fix a photo, you need to be careful to not introduce an undue amount of noise into the photo.  Doing photo work is like a cassette tape.  The more you listen to it, the more fidelity from the original is lost.  That is why it is important to save originals and fixed versions separately.  It is also the reason that many people work from RAW photos, because even the digital camera you use is typically storing and processing pictures in a compressed format like jpeg.

I also enjoy using plug-ins for doing artistic work (pseudo painting), and having some proprietary filters in place.  Filters can be very helpful because some professional has already tweaked a variety of settings that usually are not obvious or available in any given program.  These types of plug-ins were easy to install and use in X3.

Can a person who has never used any program like this before pick it up and start using it right away to browse and fix photos?  I would say yes.  These features are easily understood and the help files attached to them are easy to understand.  Is Paint Shop Photo Pro X3 recommended over all prior versions?  I would say if you have anything before X2, X3 is worth it.  If you have X2, X3 is worth the upgrade.  If you are considering more expensive programs like Lightroom, and have never used any comprehensive programs like Paint Shop (Pro), then I would start with Paint Shop Photo Pro X3.  The price difference is just too great, and X3 provides a lot of value and features for the money.

So, while I did not spend a bunch of time with a lot of features, I hope this review helps someone!"
"Works in Windows 8.1.  I had to save addresses in the address book in order for the program to find them.  Entering a one-timer address search fails to find pretty much every address that I tried.  I couldn't figure out how to default the map to Chicago;  it kept starting in Salt Lake City.  Directions from the saved addresses does seem to work.  It does have all the streets in the country.  I couldn't get any nice things like satellite view.  It's functional at best.  I expected to be wowed in 2016, but was not."
"I happy to report that the Time Sheets are now sortable by each column! I still did not appreciate the last year in which they broke the functionality until they ""fixed it"" with sortable columns, but I once again have a positive attitude towards Quickbooks. Here's hoping they don't break it or something else again -lol. (Fingers crossed)

Previous Review >Now, I can appreciate the effort Intuit goes through to improve their QB products and 2015 looks like a nice set of refinements and features. But there's one thing that has stopped me in my tracks from upgrading. Time Sheets lost the ability to sort by Customer:Job after the R3 update to QB 2014.

The worst decision an Intuit Quickbooks product manager has ever made was the change made in QB 2014 R3. When viewing a previously saved weekly timesheet, the time entries will remain in the ""order in which they were originally entered"" rather than sorted A-Z by Customer:Job.

Why in the world would they make a change like this with out leaving a way to have time sheets function the way they have for 10+ years? This alone may be the reason that I NEVER buy another QB release. And by the way, they tried this for a brief moment with QB2013 R7 and quickly reverted after bad feedback. Really seems like a simple fix - just make the columns sortable by just clicking the column heading like in databases."
"Crash Crash Crash!!! So sad! Sent it back today and I'm not sure where we will go from here. we had high hopes for this one, but no."
"Cook'n is a great company with a fantastic product.  I really love their software.  I started with Cook'n 7, and since have upgraded to Cook'n 10.  I have entered my own recipes plus newer and older recipes from family and friends that I want to save for quick access. I'm now learning the new aspect of being able to upload computer recipes into my Cook'n, and fully appreciate the fact that this is possible. It's so wonderful not having to search through recipe files and books - just a click on Cook'n and I'm ready to go!

I'm not the most literate computer person in the world and somehow, some way, I recently lost my recipes - I was devastated.  Not to worry, Tech Support jumped in and spent a lot of time working diligently on line with me.  LO AND BEHOLD!!  I have ALL my recipes back!!!

This software is easy to use.  I highly recommend this Company and their product, with - SURPRISE! - actual live Tech Support that is extremely knowledgeable, caring, and helpful who - IF a problem comes up - doesn't give up until the problem is resolved!"
"My kids love this game.  The action is constant, although on some games it doesn't give them enough time to figure it out without prompting for some kind of action.  The main problem I had was installing it onto my Windows 2000 Pro system.  I lost my hard drive, and I have to blame the software because I tried it with a fresh system, and it did the exact same thing.  So, I would say buy this only if you have a Windows 95/98/ME system, but not a Windows 2000 system.  Hopefully, Windows XP will be able to handle it."
"The installation instructions said to look for the Activation Code ""located on the back of the CD envelope"" The CD came in a plastic case and no installation code was found anywhere inside or outside.the case. I am now returning the product, since unable to install."
Easy to use. Guides you through
"First, where did all of the reviews of this product go? Last time I checked the number was large and the consensus was fairly negative.

With Mac sales up and MS always paranoid, did MS decide that the Mac version of Office could be released with reduced features and more bugs than usual? This software reminds me of what we endured the darkest days of Apple hardware/software in the mid-90s. As examples of feature cuts, Excel 2008 has neither Solver nor any of the analysis add-ins. Fairly simple operations in Excel, such as drawing a graph, sometimes now involve a substantial amount of time to complete. I can't recall the last time that attempting to draw a simple scatterplot produced a warning that due to the ""complexity"" of the graph, I might experience a long wait. Similar operations were essentially instantaneous in the 2004 version.

The only thing I have found to like about the new Excel is the increase in the number of cells in the spreadsheet.

In Word, as in the bad old days, simply scrolling is an adventure. The screen does not re-draw correctly even in a short document with simple formatting. Be careful about scrolling and then deleting. You may be very surprised by which portion of text disappears.

I've been a Mac user since System 6, and I'm hard pressed to remember an ""upgrade"" this stripped of features and full of bugs."
Was cheap! Great! Effortless.
"Somehow, this thing calculated my state review as if I were not a state resident.  I have no idea how that happened; I reside in the state where I earned my money.  So, I got a letter from the state saying that my refund wasn't nearly as much as it should have been."
Will not install on Windows 7.  I've spent several hours trying to get this to install.  I'm contacting Amazon for a refund.
Easy to install and update to lasted patches. I would purchase one again for my family
This software has taught all three of our children to type at a young age with almost no parental involvement.
"I loaded the software but it would not launch from my computer.  The only customer support available is by emailing through the website, which I did.  However, it took 2 weeks to get a response to my email, and the response I received was of no help at all.  Basically I paid for nothing, since I have not been able to use this product and don't have the patience to wait for a response from this company.  Plus, it all took so long that now Amazon won't take the return.  A total waste of money as far as I'm concerned."
This works well with Ancestry.com information.  I had no problem downloading it on my laptop.  I did have a slight issue with working with two family trees but I figured it out.
Preload my PC was very helpful!  They went above and beyond to assist us with the installation problems we had with AutoDesk.  The issues we experienced were 100% related to AutoDesk security and problems with our Corporate Firewall but Preload myPC continued to support us until it was installed properly.  Would purchase again.  Thanks!
"The progam is easy to use and seems to work seamlessly,  I wish I would have set it up years ago.  I migrated from GNU Cash.

My only recommendation - I would like more flexability to customize reports."
"I sell raw materials to industry for a living, and my (otherwise great) company doesn't provide any kind of contact management/sales tools for the sales force. One the hand hand, it's very frustrating not to have a ""go-to"" tool for my everyday tasks. On the other hand, they don't give me much opposition to devising my own tools that work the way I want them to.

I have done the ""use Excel as a database"" thing for a year now, as many professionals do, and it's awkward at best. Excel was never meant to be a database, we all know that. And FileMaker, as powerful as it is, requires that you already be pretty savvy at devising databases to actually get it to do the things that you want, the way you want. I don't have time to learn not only how to use a completely new piece of software, but actually how to set it up and program it, too. I might as well just change jobs and find work as a database engineer!

SO, my research turned up Bento. Based on my reading, I was doubtful that Bento would be able to do everything I needed, but I thought for $49, if it did half of what I needed, it would be still be a good buy. In use, Bento is a joy - the design templates are very easy to set up (if somewhat limited in choice, but again, it's supposed to be a quick and easy setup, so offering too many starting points would be counterintuitive), and setting up your fields and libraries is so intuitive that it's doubtful you will need to read the manual for much more than an occasional reference.

Usage templates are included for home inventories, project management, pretty much anything you would use a simple database for. Since I'm trying to get some more sophistication out of it, none of the templates  really offered me anything except some learning reference, so I had to start from scratch.

Having spent a week with it now, I will say that, for $49, and given how it is advertised, Bento is a no-brainer. It is a fantastically well-executed simple database and a joy to use. For importing your iCal events and address book contacts and pretty powerful contact management capabilities, it would be worth the $49 alone.

But since I had hoped to use it for a few other tasks, I came across its three key weaknesses. Again, it is unfair to blame something for not being what the producers don't claim that it is in the first place, but the price/performance point is a heartbreaker. I would have paid $79 or $99 (actually, I would have paid $199 given how valuable it could be to me) if the three main weaknesses could be addressed. For anyone interested or considering using it professionally, here they are:

1. The ""calculation"" field option is limited to simple math. Field entries using calculations can be interactive, of course, but they cannot accept an additive command entry (e.g. take the entry and make the change permanent in the database until I enter something new in the field, but also not lose the previous entry's value in the database).

I'll explain: the raw materials that I sell are subject to market volatility (e.g the price changes almost every day). I had hoped to be able to create a library of raw materials that I sell with important info about each one - which I can - but I wanted to create a ""net price change since yesterday"" field that would take my simple price change entry, then distribute that change throughout the database for each customer to whom I am quoting/selling that material. I could then start my morning with my change notification emails, make the changes in the database in 5-10 minutes, then create a contacts list of customers affected by the changes and send mass emails to notify them quickly. What normally takes hours in my day could be reduced to about 10-15 minutes.

Since the calculation possibilities for such a field do not allow additive entry, that means that any change that I make will be absolute in the database, not additive. If I add 5 cents/pound to a price today, fine, but if I try to add an additional 3 cents/pound tomorrow, it will just take the 3 cents, erase the 5 cents from yesterday, and distribute 3 cents throughout the database. So it's useless as a pricing monitor. Not that it matters, anyway, because...

2. Data interactivity between libraries is limited to simple importing/exporting of data in table form (called ""related fields"" in Bento nomenclature). Within any given library, you can specify a data import field from any other library, and the data will remain interactive of course, but you're stuck with the same import parameters for each record in the new library. I quote different customers different prices for the same materials based on volumes, freight differences, etc. Even if my materials library could accept an additive price change command, there would be no way to program the database to know how to distribute that mathematical information differently to different customer records. Bento's import fields option is clearly designed to import contact info for project management so that you can, for example, see contact info for everyone working on a project on the same screen without having to switch to your Address Book or Address Book library in Bento and search blindly. Cool feature for what it is, just not very sophisticated.

3. While setting up your database, you can duplicate fields and forms, but you cannot duplicate libraries. Since I track information in similar ways for customers, materials, and projects, it would have been great to set up one, use it as a template, and duplicate & tweak as necessary. Instead, I had to go through a labor-intensive process to get each of my libraries set up.

Bento will undoubtedly prove useful and time-saving to me. Although it was not able to do the one REALLY time saving thing that I had hoped, it can do pretty much everything else for my contact management, including:

1. Track sales by customer, volume, total $, net $, and any combination thereof.
2. Manage short and long term projects
3. Track problem matters and ensure up-to-date info on resolution.

You can, of course, do these tasks any any other number of ways, but Bento provides a way to do it all in one piece of software, on one screen. I pray that next year they will offer a $49 upgrade to ""Bento Pro"" or something that will allow the other tasks I really need. I actually could get my work week under 40 hours with that and still get everything done!"
"This is the first review for any product I've ever been compelled to write...good or bad. This is so bad that I have to vent about the poor quaility of the software and support for it. There is a reason why 1/3 of the reviews on Amazon are 1 star. Don't waste your time setting this software up to watch it fail in everyway!!!!!!

1. There isn't a customer service number. No joke. You have to navigate your way through their web site to request someone to call you because the Quicken department doesn't take incoming calls.
2. The software is laden with errors that haven't been corrected on its 8th revision
3. Its is complete unintuitive. Simple things are complicated.
4. Online updates have a 50% success rate of updating.
5. Quicken gives you full access to accounts for the first 60 days via direct connect and then removes it on accounts where they are not contracted with that vendor to offer the service. That means, for instance, I have a B of A credit card that I was able to update daily for the first 60 days. Then, without warning, I got errors, and BofA says I can only update upon my statement close. Really? So much for keeping track of cash flow. That's the whole point of this software!!!

The list goes on. Don't waste your time..."
"I was hopeful that this product would fit our needs based on positive customer feedback but that was not the case. The Adapter failed after one week and after requesting a replacement adapter through Warpia Tech support for a replacement, I never heard back from them. In addition the Warpia driver that is required for this to work, kept displaying an error when the PC was booted, This was observed on 2 other PC's as well. Because of these issues, I returned the product for a refund."
"If you're using Windows 2000 or Windows XP in a secure mode, to try and provide a second line of defense against viruses too new to be caught by your anti-virus software, Quicken 2002 will not make you very happy.  It still is really a Windows 95 application, and gleefully writes all over the application directory (C:\Program Files\Quicken) every time it starts up.
If you have user accounts on Windows 2000 that are ""Restricted User"" (in the Users group), the software will not run out-of-the-box.  You will have to modify the security on the application directory to add Modify and Write permissions for the Users group.  This, of course, means that any virus that gets into your computer can attack and infest any file that is part of Quicken.
Having the application directory be writeable was not ""safe computing"" when Intuit wrote Quicken many years ago, and it is not ""safe computing"" now.  Microsoft guidelines have you store all state under the user account in C:\Documents and Settings.  It is telling that Quicken does NOT have any ""Windows logo"" certification from Microsoft.  Maybe Quicken doesn't trust Microsoft not to show the new version to the Microsoft Money people, but Intuit also must know that it would flunk the certification process horribly!  It is time to shame the application developers into making software that practices ""safe computing"", or we will be in virus hell forever.
At least I could make Quicken 2002 run at all for a ""Restricted User"".  Quicken 2001 tried to write to the Windows Registry every time it started, battling with Money over some file extension, there was no reasonable way to make that work.  Quicken 2001 would only work on accounts with ""Power User"" priveleges, which I refuse to grant my everyday account for virus-protection reasons.  (Yes, I know this is the default account protection on Windows 2000 and XP, but that's because the applications are all messed up.)
Other than that, the program does seem to be well-behaved.  I finally have something newer than Quicken 6 that runs on Windows 2000."
I'm still learning the format and getting into it but this software is extremely easy to use and you can rapidly create content! Highly recommended!!
Very pleased with this software . This is the second software I bought from the same manufacturer.  My daughter who is 14 learned using Typing instructor and she can type 80 words per minute. Very good customer service. I lost my CD sleeve where the activation code was and I just went online and file it under tech support and got a new activation code in minutes.
Very good!
I'm a home user and this download never mentioned that you had to have Java extensions.  I'm unable to use this  item.
"I've used TurboTax Deluxe for over ten years, and this year I ordered the same product not expecting Intuit to be underhanded. I wish I'd read the product reviews first. Perhaps Amazon will take my unopened software back. I certainly will not use TurboTax again."
"I, like many folks, have been using Quicken / TurboTax for a while now - for me, 8 years.  That's over [money amount]a year to Intuit.
The last few years, I've put up with the Advertising.  ... ... This year, however, is the last straw.
I gave TT2002 a shot - I wrestled with it for 3 days now, and Intuit's customer service is a Customer No-Service.  My major mistake was counting on Intuit's reputation, and not checking out reviews before I paid out good money for this program.
Another lost customer for you Intuit, moving to (sigh) Microsoft Money and TaxCut."
What can I say; Lightroom and Photoshop one year software license at a slight discount for Cyber Monday.  Gotta have it.
Was very useful
"I must admit that I purchased this product with some trepidation. There were so many negative reviews here and elsewhere I decided to do some personal research on my own. What I found was very positive and I really liked the price. Since installing it and applying most of the automated features I am very pleased. I have been using Windows Live One Care for several months now and it has not let me down once. I operates quietly in the background and performs tasks like backup, disc cleanup and defragmentation on a schedule as advertised. I have had none of the ""glitches"" I had experienced with Norton and some other internet security software. I highly recommend it."
Did a great job for me
Microsoft says my the activation key is fake and that what I bought is an illegal copy of Windows.
I've been using Turbo Tax for years. It's always been easy to use and I really like the It's Deductible software that is included. We always have lots of donations and this is the simplest way to determine the correct value to assign to each item. Turbo Tax beats Tax Cut by a long shot! It's worth the little bit of extra money to have this program. We also used H&R Block one year when I didn't think I would have time to do it myself. Big mistake! So expensive and the people preparing our taxes knew less than I did. I'll be sticking with Turbo Tax from now on.
This app works very well. It is better than iTunes for the music that I have on my device. Just very well designed.
"Just a heads-up that Amazon's download version only allows you to use your refund bonus for Amazon gift cards (unlike last year, which did not include Amazon, but did include several other vendors). Software purchased directly from H&R Block allows you to pick from a variety of vendors (e.g., Home Depot, Target), but not Amazon. The interesting part is that H&R Block's online marketing shows Amazon, Target and Home Depot as all available for the refund bonus. In fairness to Amazon, its packaging only mentions the Amazon bonus, but I assumed that software purchased here would allow me to choose another vendor if desired, due to H&R Block's marketing. But no - I chatted with an H&R Block rep tonight and he claimed there's also an exclusive setup gift card bonus with Wal-Mart purchases too. If that's so, H&R Block apparently went to the trouble to write custom executables for distribution via Wal-Mart and Amazon. Weird and disappointing and I was fooled -- guess Ill have to buy this directly from H&R Block next year if I want bonus flexibility."
"We can't avoid taxes, but this takes most of the pain away since it's so easy to use."
"IMHO not as good as norton, But should still keep you safe"
Great Price!! Great Product!!!
"I agree with Edmac:  after upgrading to V4 on my older pc, CPU utilization jumped during scans and my computer becomes unusable.  I have tried to schedule scans for middle of the night using the scheduling feature but these scans still kick in at seemingly random times, so I've started disabling them during the day to see if that stops the problem.

NOD32 used to offer two substantial advantages over competitors:  fairly comprehensive virus detection and great efficiency (because of the way the software is written, it was not a resource hog).  Now it's a resource hog.

I plan to restore V3 on my primary computer."
handy for reviewing my spanish
"I chose this product because it offers many video and slideshow capture, creation and editing capabilities not found in competing products.  In particular, some of these features include: The Storyboard which allows you to mix photos and videos with transitions; Applying Pan and Zoom Effects to videos and photos; and SmartVideo Capture where you can preview video scenes directly from your camera and only import selected scenes. It performs well on XP and the upgrade to 7.0.1 was worth the large download.  If you own a digital camera or DV camera, this is a must have product."
"Delorme is the Premier Mapping company for the regular traveler. A lot more can be accomplished than can be accomplished on the Internet. ALl the Gas Stations in a particular can be found, along with stores or in my case all the churches in a particular area can be found along with phone numbers, etc.. A very useful map program. Year after year, always satisfied with the amount of info available."
hmph
"For a curious 14 year old it is just the ticket!  He WANTS to use this program.  It gives ""assignments"" but also allows the student to play around with the circuits and come up with their own things.  (The way it is laid out really does teach about electricity in the real world.)"
"I've had NIS on my PC for about 6 months and ever since I installed it I've had problems accessing my XP user accounts and the internet.  It slows down my system in the boot up, web surfing and shut down process.  I've tried reinstalling it and although it's a little better it still prevents me from downloading files or installing new programs (like Yahoo music engine).  My children can't access any of their web sites when logged into their XP account (like Nick Jr. or Disney.com) which is due to NIS's parental control but even when I turn NIS off they still can't access them.  I'm going to uninstall it and start using Microsoft's new free security programs which is the configuration I have on my laptop and it works much better."
"Instant Immersion Spanish Deluxe is an enigma. Clearly significant development effort was devoted to the original application framework. However, there are so many problems with the application in its current form, it appears that there were either two development groups (i.e. the company or the intellectual property was acquired) with a disjointed development process or the company ran out of money during the development process.

While there are some gee wiz features, such an avatar that shows proper lip movements for various words, the program is very poorly designed. There is a calendar and task lists that supposedly coach the user through his or her progression. Yet the tasks jump around in difficultly without proper repetition and with no continuity between steps.

Other problems include the fundamental content. In some of the question and answer modules, the pictures do not correspond to clear answers. In other words, there would be a very basic scene and three potential answers written in Spanish for which it is not clear, even with the English translations, what a ""correct"" answer would be.

In summary, Instant Immersion Spanish has myriad content that should be displayed in a completely redesigned interface with improved progression of the material.

Cons (notice how Cons comes before Pros)

1)Hard to navigate

2)Material difficulty doesn't follow a clear pattern

3)Oddly vague answers to specific questions

4)Can't copy the program to disk requiring the reliance on the five CDs

Pros

1)Good audio CD's (three separate audio disks)

2)Advanced content (mixing audio and video; avatar)"
"Excellent financial management program, easy to use. Budgeting,bill paying,portfolio, bank accounts, credit card accounts,mortgages and loans, tax management, and retirement planning are all handled with ease and accuracy. I do recommend that you get Peter Weverka's book - ""Microsoft Money 2004 for Dummies"" if you would like to be able to use the program to the fullest extent with the least confusion. Together, they're unbeatable!"
"Great experience, great value. Item was as described, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone wanting to get O365 for a very reasonable price"
I update a couple of times a year and it pays for itself
"Not too bad of a game. My 5 yr old loves all the Jumpstart games, he played this for a little while but it didn't keep his interest for very long."
"If I have to recommend Office, I'd recommend Office 2010. They made many improvements in 2010, and it runs like greased lightning on an Atom powered Netbook. Office 2013, on the other hand, crawls on the same laptop that ran Office 2010 perfectly fine (Core 2 Duo P8400 2.26 GHz, 4GB DDR3). Office 2013 also has visual improvements that slow down Excel to the point I am waiting for my cursor to move over after using the arrow keys about 10 seconds ago. Shutting off the visual improvements helps, but it takes an extra 3-5 seconds to open up Office applications or files. Outlook 2013 is even slower.

The cool aspect of Office 2013 is that the applications have a more simplified look and feel, but that is about it. I see no benefit to upgrade 2010 to 2013, and I actually had 3 more licenses that I could use but won't be upgrading all of my computers after evaluating 2013 on my main computer. Office 2010 is what I'll be using and recommending.

Overall: 1 out of 5 stars. Change for the sake of change, slower, and looks simplified but that is about it."
Defective product.  Will not load.  Crashes every time you try to load the disk.  I will not purchase from this seller again.
Have been using TurboTax for years... plan to continue to use it for years more.
"I've been using TurboTax for the past 20 years.  It seems to get easier to do my taxes with each yearly release.  This year I only had to manually enter the values from this year's W2 form and my mortgage information.  Everything else was pulled directly into the software and all of the forms were populated automatically.  There was absolutely no guess work on what financial information went where.  I have many investment accounts and all of that information was pulled in by simply choosing the institution and entering my login and password.  Love, love, love TurboTax!!!"
Yes of course this item is out dated . It is from The mid 90's. I played this game as a child and it was so fun. Now of course it doesn't stand up graphic wise to games now a days. But I had so much making movies and playing this game.
"After initially receiving just the upgrade version instead of the full version like I had ordered, I contacted Amazon and was amazed at how fast the correct product arrived!  Returning the incorrect product was very easy as well!
 I'm happy to say we're very happy with version X6.  It's very user friendly and has lots of nice features which makes it very easy to create awesome documents.  It's so much easier to use than Word."
"Patrick has nailed it again. This is a very complete and detailed training on accuracy. Yet, there are some very simple keys that are extremely effective. If you take time to ingrain the fundamentals into your habits, and then focus on the one simple key....you can not help but become better. I participated in a live fire training session recently, and saw the effects. I got speed from his other program, but was also more accurate than the other students. As the instructor said, a fast miss is still a miss. Don't miss. This program is worth your time and money!"
"We purchased this product in Dec 2010.  We just tried to install it in March 2011 and got a message after entering the product key that we had exceeded the maximum number of licenses.  That is impossible since this is the very first time we tried to install it.

Also, this is a subscription, not software, and you need to renew each year for big $$.  This is not mentioned here and will cost us plenty.

Overall, I highly recommend you look elsewhere."
good stuff
"I did not find this product to be as bad as a lot of the surveys indicated. It does not work the same as the Quicken for Windows as the updating feature is not the same, and is more cumbersome. The more I work with it, the more I find it will do. I had used the Windows version for years, and that alone makes the transition somewhat more difficult. All things considered this item is working okay, and I expect it to be better over time. My expectations were met."
"Simple on it's own, great when used with Corel's Bryce 5. Create models for export and add textures with Bryce. Cheap 3ds max alternative."
ok
"I've used the Kasperskt Internet Security products for several years. My research confirmed that this product is a valuable and reliable tool used to protect my home PC from threats through Internet usage. This product/brand is a highly rated by many computer experts that I have consulted. My purchase of this product through Amazon saved me nearly 50% from the price listed on the manufactures web-site. The product was easily installed by on-line download and also included a ""Rescue Recovery"" CD that I received by mail with this subscription. This product has been very user friendly and has yet allowed any corruption to infect my PC."
"I was disappointed with the features in this new edition of TurboTax after having used the Online Only version for several years in a row, and this was my first time going back to the ""download/PC"" version in quite some time. The software is really bare minimum, offering no extra help, and it's not even particularly smart at importing old tax files. It got the job done but I was surprised at how rudimentary it seemed while entering my information. There is very little difference between this ""heavy"" version and the online ""lite"" version. But, I bought this one because it was a better value for the cost."
"I got this as an upgrade from my 9.6 version.  It was fairly inexpensive but then Libre Office, another program suite, is free for the downloading.  I'm just very comfortable with Lotus.

Lotus SmartSuite has all the programs a standard program suite should have: word processor, drawing program, spreadsheet, data base, and time manager. (And a couple others, I think)  I can't quite grok the database program, Access, which is unusual for me, but maybe I haven't tried.  Not too many people set up databases especially since a good spreadsheet program can work like one and data entry is much faster in a spreadsheet.

Word Pro is my preferred private writing program. For one thing, there aren't many other programs that can read the *.lwp files.  There are other formats that you can save your document in, even the standard *.doc format from you know who.

The spreadsheet program is an oldie but goody.  I started on Lotus 123 v. 1, on either the original IBM PC or the XT.  That was a few years ago.  And once you know what one spreadsheet has, most of the others just take a little time to get used to them.

The time management program is rather neat.  It is set up like a physical, in the hand, organizer with a calendar, contacts, notepad, and to do list. These are the ones I have used. You can customize it many ways and the calendar section, which has a few not so perfect features that I can live with, and a few unique features that I really like, is a life saver for me."

"I have been using ZoneAlarm for 3 years so far, and it is the lightest, easiest to setup and safest PC firewall around. Zonelabs deserves the price we pay for this software just as a display of gratitude for the results it gives."

"What a headache and a waste of time and money!  I used this product to transfer from an XP desktop to a new Vista desktop.  Getting it to transfer in the first place was a frustrating, time consuming struggle, involving an online chat with tech support, who was marginally helpful at best.  They resolved the issue by having me switch ends of the transfer cable, which has NO MARKINGS to indicate that it makes any difference which way it is connected.  After several tries the transfer worked.  14 hours later it was done.  I then started to explore the new computer to find that almost none of the transferred software worked.  Those that did work, such as photoshop, were unable to open any of the associated files that were transferred with them.  I tried uninstalling and reinstalling several applications to find that they would not work at all because PCMover had changed OS settings.  I talked with tech support for several software apps and they could not understand why they wouldn't work.  I was advised that PCMover had corrupted the OS, and that I would need to erase and recover the hard drive.  I am now in the process of doing that.  Hopefully PCMover hasn't completely trashed my new PC.  With any luck I will be starting fresh tomorrow at square one where I was before I ever installed this crap software.

Save yourself a lot of time and aggravation by just manually re-installing your software and transferring your necessary files.  I wish I had."
"The office for Mac 2004 software is a much needed improvement over 2001. The additional templates in Word are long over due. I know it won't happen, but I would like to see Publisher for Mac."
"This is my second annual installment of this internet security software. The download works great, and it is not as much hassle as my previous version of Kaspersky (constant updating). I was introduced to Webroot by the Geek Squad, and so far it has been great. Save yourself money and purchase the downloaded version rather than renewing with the prior Webroot software. My original purchase was the packaged disc version, and I was asked to renew for a discounted price which is  still higher than downloaded Webroot version. Instead I bought downloaded version and inputed new key code. I did not have any problems as previous customers had noted earlier. I recommend this product."
"I have been using TurboTax for years.  I keep returning to it for its ease of use and reliable results.  It quickly imports all my personal information from the prior years return.  It is compatible with Quicken, Quickbooks, and Mint.com, and imports W-2s and 1099 Interest statements from many institutions.  TurboTax is user-friendly, walking you through each income item and deduction.  My stumbling block every year is finding where to enter my installment sale income (its under a random subcategory of business property sales that is not intuitive), but otherwise, the question and answer format works well for me.  I file Schedules A, D, and E each year along with Forms 2441 (Child and Dependent Care Expenses), 6252 (Installment Sales), and 8283 (NonCash Charitable Contributions).  TurboTax makes quick work of all these.  Last year was the first time I used ItsDeductible to determine the value of my in-kind charitable donations, and I loved it!  I like having the option to talk with a CPA if necessary, but I haven't had to use that service yet.  My only real complaint is that e-filing of the state tax return is not included.  It is certainly not worth paying an additional $20 to e-file the state return when it can be printed and mailed for less than $1.  But, overall, TurboTax is good tax software."
Perfect
A product that I need but do not like that much.  The price was good.
"I am very pleased with the purchase, the speed in which I received it and the performance is very good.  I have used Norton for 4 yrs. and am very pleased with it.

Amazon is very good to deal with and I will RETURN for more items as I need them."
I had a virus on one of my computers.  I had to pay $50 to get on line help.  I was e-mailed a document of how to fix the problem.  The first thing I had to do was to down load a 3rd party product to fix the problem.  Then I was to go to Microsoft and install their firewall and Internet security package instead of Zone Alarms.
Quickbooks Online is the top product out there to do your bookkeeping. Customization is easy and everything you need to see in Reports is a few clicks away.
"I've been a die hard Apple user since I started with a computer.  My wife, the total opposite.  I have gotten my dad and brother to switch over to Apple machines too.  If you NEED Windows, then this is the way to go.  I however like using the software that matches what you'd need for a Windows machine.  Nice to have both if you NEED it though.  A nice solution."
Very good product. Everybody delighted
Can google all this for free.
Turustworthy as usual.  I have been using TurboTax for over 6 years.
Easy to use and fast.  That means I'll actually back up my data on a regular basis.
I have had Kaspersky for 4 or 5 years and have always felt safe - and no reason to change
"To call it a basic at all is to misname it.
I , now, use it everyday

The hardest thing is to figure what is ""global"" and what is local.

I can tell you that it is the only language that has made me afraid to try something becauce of how bad it crashes my machine.
It has made me feel sorry for my poor Mac

"It's hard to review a security program for your computer, but all in all the Trend Micro Titanium works well so far. I installed it on two different computers and the process was fairly easy. The updating did take a bit of time but that's fairly normal for security programs. After a few weeks of using it the one installed on my husband's computer has caught quite a few potential threats, so we're definitely satisfied!"

"I use Windows 2000 on my computer at home. I setup different profiles, for my family members, and by assigning them passwords, they each have a seperate profile, similar to Win98. But they are better protected from each  other, The Internet connection sharing works wells, allowing thier Kidputer  to access the Internet via my DSl connection. and the system can be set to  forbid installs or changes to the basic OS. I like it, and it's worth  it.
For Mobile user, check for Video and Sound driver before purchase. My  new HP 3270 does not support Win2000 yet, Although everthing works except  the built in sound/modem . It needs a driver from ESS & HP."
I am so glad I upgraded my Office...I absolutely love the new features.  Very user friendly.
"The ""Business"" part of the ""Home & Business"" didn't work at all for my business partnership.  Apparently it only works for individuals rather than partnerships.  Not what I wanted."
IT IS AS DESCRIBED IN EVERY WAY! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO HAS A NEED IN THIS AREA.
Great product - easy to install and easy to use.

"i guess i didn't realize that carmen san diego software is somewhat old and newer systems have much updated fancier versions of quicktime, that will not run carmen. making this cd completely non usable.!!!

i have recently bought a mac, but know that this will also probably not work since mac also has very updated version of quicktime, also resolution has to be dummied down to only 256 colors, it is non operable in millions of colors that all new pc and mac systems have.

the main point: make sure older game software is compatible.

also thank goodness i did not spend much."
"I have been using this program for quite some time.  I really like it...very easy to use and the audio and video are great.  I have several of their other programs also.  They all are great"""
I used it an it for sure wiped my drive.
it worked great - done everything that i expected
Love it just what i needed sure does work the way it should .
"I recently downloaded Premier 2013, upgrading from 2012 (with which I was perfectly happy), for the mobile application for my iPad. We travel for several weeks at a time and I hope that entering expenses on the go would save a bundle of bills to enter upon my return and facilitate identification. I don't download automatically from accounts preferring to make all my own entries with notations where needed and I have found errors in credit card charges on several occasions. So my needs in syncing may be simpler to others.

Given the reviews I approached cautiously downloading 2013 onto a spare netbook first and then getting the mobile app. I entered transactions into my iPad for several days and synced the netbook. Meanwhile keeping my desktop completely separate running 2012, and backing it up, as a check. No glitches, all went smoothly. Then I installed 2013 on my desktop and synced. I had to choose between accepting the cloud data or my desktop's. I chose my desktops because I knew it was correct. I then had to keep signing into the cloud, creating a cloud account I had already created and finally it synced. All was well until I went back to my netbook and synced that. It wouldn't sync telling me that the cloud data file was different to my netbooks! Well of course it was, but why couldn't it just sync it and update the netbook? I've no idea. I finally gave up and copied my desktop Quicken file to a thumb drive, and restored that onto the netbook. Then it synced. So currently all is well and I find the iPad mobile app great. I'd like to get rid of all the budget blather up front on the app since I know what I spend and on what, so don't do budgets."
"Very easy to install; no computer skills required.

McAfee is my preferred choice of protection.  I've never had issues

On my daughter's laptop, I was able to install parental controls.  On my desktop and laptop, it was easy to skip the installation of parental controls.

Highly recommend!"
"I purchased my Microsoft Picture It! Publishing 2001-Silver Edition in 2001.  I found it very user friendly, and indeed I was creating flash cards, games, and original books written by my students, and even picture books for my non-readers.  They enjoyed seeing pix of themselves that I had taken and interwoven into their own printed books.  I could never have done all that without this program.  I am a speech pathologist and found that the youngsters could really relate to something that had their picture in it of something they liked.  I created home programs for my students' parents as well.  For friends and relatives I created greeting cards, signs, and a brochure for a garden tour.  I used my own photos or one of the thousands of clip art pix on the 4 disks that came with the program.  The ease at which I could use this program was amazing.

Then I got Win XP and found that it still worked, except for a few things it would not do.  I contacted MS about downloads to help me use it with XP.  I was told that the program is no longer available and could not be upgraded to use on XP.  So I used as much of it as I could until I got Win Vista.  Then it shut down completely and would not run at all on Vista.  Too bad that something this good, easy to use, and valuable should be discontinued. I purchased Microsoft Office 2007 because I was told that anything you could do on ""Picture It Publishing 2001"" you can do on ""MS Office 2007.""  That is not true.  Also I found MS Office 2007 to be quite a bit harder to use and not user friendly at all.  So I give a grade of ""A+"" for MS Picture It! Publishing 2001, and ""F"" to Microsoft for not continuing to publish this valuable program."
Does it work with HD1 roland kit? The early version..
"I never thought about buying year old software to save. This was a great deal, and quick delivery! What else should I say?"
great product at a great price!  It was exactly what I was looking for and the price was even better than I had expected.
Used on Mac and Microsoft. Great buy
"BUMMER--WILL NOT RUN ON WINDOWS SEVEN WITH 64 BIT MACHINE. EMAILED COMPANY AND NO RESPONSE. JUST MONEY DOWN THE TUBES AND SELLER DID NOT KNOW IF IT WOULD FUNCTION. SAVE YOUR PENNIES AND FIND ANOTHER, IF YOU CAN. GOOD LUCK."
"have purchased this product for many years, it is quick fast accurate and easy to use. I will use this again next year"
I had some difficulty at first. Called Tech Services they were very helpful . I will purchase this product again. HOWEVER THE DISC WAS OUTDATED (A OLDER VERSION) NOT 2015 HOWEVER I gave this product 5 Stars due to the Technical person who assisted me. I do not know if this was a accident concerning the outdated product. I now have the 2015 Version.
"Have been using TurboTax for ten years or more. It does everything I could ask for and more, highly recommended to everyone."
"This Norton security was easy to install. However, my computer is bit slow now and I don't know the reason.  I also tried to put this on my tablet but having some problem and I need to contact the tech support.
Overall, I have been using Norton security software for several years and will keep it in future as well."
"Webroot Secure has proven to be an excellent program that does not hog memory or slow down processes like MacAfee that I was formerly using. This is extremely important since I've used both programs on my Desktop, Laptop, and notebook. All of my devices now boot up and run faster whether I'm on the internet or working offline. Very important when notebooks and laptop don't have a lot of RAM or the most powerful processer."
Sure helped my computer skills.
This is a compilation of possible questions for canidates who wants to take the examination. There are questions and options and there is an explanation of why the answer has been chosen.
"First it did not have the forms for a 1099B.  Then I had to pay $30 more to get the next step up.  Then I was unable to understand the new forms so I was unable to fill them  out.
Bottom line it cost me $241 at H and R Block to file my taxes.
If I was able to talk to someone at your company explain the new forms I would have been alright.  But it is impossible to find a phone number to your company.

Not a happy camper and probably will not use you again"
You already know the product. EXCELLENT deal!!
great program for drawing
"Initially a little hard to get used to, but once you master the user  interface, you'll be hooked. You can do almost anything with Star Office  that you can with Microsoft Office.
The capability of opening and saving  to MS Office file formats makes this the program to have.
I use Star  Office exclusively for all of my work, on both my Windows and Linux  machines."
Works well & links to Photoshop.
"I love how easy this was to dowload, and how easily it was installed on my personal computer. Would recommend to anyone."
Microsoft continues to refuse to acknowledge it.
"We bought this product to convert legal documents. It will convert them but you lose all formatting including line numbering and strikethroughs. This made the converted documents completely useless. The program takes over your computer, freezes Internet Explorer and continually overrides Acrobat as the default reader. Customer service at Nuance is beyond awful. I was expected to pay to have them fix problems that are inherent to the program. I will never buy another Nuance product."
"i want a refund. This software never worked. We've installed and reinstalled it and we still have a black screen. We can't do anything with the screen. I'm well versed in photoshop and was hoping this would be a great way to involve my stepdaughter in photoediting. so disappointed. i've spent way too long looking up support for this black screen situation and i still can't find a fix. the tutorials that are included with the software as well as those on youtube don't even address this. maybe it's just me- and the many other ppl I found online with similar questions- but this product doesn't work. AT ALL. and since we bought the downloaded version, we'll never be able to refund it. $26 gone. absolute garbage."
I use it all the time
"I am currently a nursing student, and I use Microsoft Office a lot for school. I used Office 2007 up until about 2 years ago and I've been very happy with the changes that have been made. I recently bought a new laptop and needed to install Office 2010 so I purchased the disc version. We have 2 other computers in the house also so the 3PC option was great. Installation was quick and easy with no glitches. The Home and Student version does not have Outlook or Acess (which I do not need) but just be sure to notice this before ordering if you do use them. All 3 computers in our home now have 2010 and all are working fine. I still love the new look that 2010 brought (ribbon, etc.) and it always gets the job done for me. Also like the way Power Point is set up. I think it is perfect for students like myself, but as with anything else you should do your research and make sure you are getting the version right for you."
Ok
"Product arrived very quickly and even though I am not computer literate, was very easy to install.  Would order again without any reservation."
"I thought it was great that Wordperfect now included an e-mail component plus some other much needed features like a somewhat better PDF conversion utility and better compatibility with Microsoft products.

The only problem is that these features have long been available for Microsoft products such as Works, Word, Excel and Access. A much better PDF utility is provided by the inexpensive PDF-Maker program because Wordperfect's PDF's do not transfer images. I thought, what good is a PDF without illustrations, charts or pictures? I could not use this in my business or I would be called sloppy or careless.

It am also disapointed that the clip-art and most of the family templates and tools. Works has had an e-mail and contact manager for many years now. Most ust usefultemplates are only available for a steep price in a productivity pack on the Corel website. Microsoft never sold me templates or tools or seperate things to make the programs work at a minimal level. They offer them freely to anyone who downloads them. I am really disappointed that this program was not as fully-featured as it promised to be in the ads and, unfortunately, I have to direct a future customer to seriouly look at MS Works 8.5, MS Office 2003 Student and Teacher Edition or even Star Office 7.0. Look carefully over the real prices and features of this product before spending a great deal on Wordperfect. You will only find that you must buy several productivity packs(at $40 each) just to match a basic edition of Word or Star (or Works).

I gave it two stars because it is only a repackaging of the old version  with the e-mail pack included. File conversion is still poor and PDF conversion untrustworthy. I wish I never messed around with this product . It is like a never-ending sink hole for money"
Software is not compatible with Windows 10 and does not support Office 365 Outlook 16.  Talking to tech support they have no plans to correct the version.  I would stay away from this software.  Was a good product prior to introduction of Windows 10 and upgrade of Office 365.
"I was worried about buying this software after reading all the reviews.  But I couldn't find anything else that did what I wanted it to do so I had no choice but to try it.

So far, I love it.  Granted, I haven't had it for all that long, but I believe I will be happy with it.

I haven't had any issues with installation.  It installed with no problems at all.  I haven't had any of the other problems I've read about in other reviews.

The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was that it took me what seemed like forever to find one of the features I was looking for (one of the more important ones, to me).  The software is very different from the previous one I used.  I had paperport as it was bundled with my printer's software.  I upgraded my computer to one that has Windows 7 Pro.  I had to reinstall all my software.  Yeah, that was fun.  Most of my software was not compatible so I had to go online to download the newest drivers.  That was not a problem.  I got everything I needed, EXCEPT PAPERPORT!  I could not get an update to paperport because it was bundled with the printer software.  So I was able to get the newest driver for the printer, but not an update for paperport.

The version of paperport that comes bundled with the printer (at least the version I received), is much different from this version.  This version has a LOT MORE to it!  It looks much better, too.  However, that means it took me a while to figure things out and find al the features I used to use. But it looks like I'll be able to do everything I was able to do with the ""bundled"" version I had, and more!"
"I purchased the software as a ""have fun"" item for my 14 year old granddaughter and she is..enjoying.. it!"
It did not download
"ASP functions well in processing RAW images. The primary problems for me are:
1. After processing RAW it will not export directly to PaintShopPro in its native format - only TIFF and JPEG
2. Requires a separate program to import photos from camera - an extra step.
3. Poor integration with PSP X6
I would recommend the Adobe product which can be found for about $100. It is much better integrated with PhotoShop Elements 11."
"When it worked, it worked great. I put simple projects together so I don't need a lot of features. However, sometime between June and end of July 2016, apparently a Windows Update prevents this application from opening. I would give it 1 star, but when it did work, I liked it very much."
"I purchased the 2013 Quicken Deluxe to use on my new Windows 8 computer. From what I've used so far, it seems just like my old 2011 version, which means that it does what I expect from it. My only disappointment is that there is still no Quicken iPad app that can download my investment portfolios. I hope Intuit is reading this!"
"Far better than I expected. I had been using Turbo Tax for several years... but they have begun taking short cuts, and trimming out features. HR Block has a great presentation and features."
"Fantastic value for the money!  And so far, it has kept my in-laws' computers safe.  This has been money well-spent so my husband does not have to go over the clean up malware/virus infections for them."
"I have used TaxCut for many years and recently switched to TurboTax.  Last year I e-filed my return,using TaxCut, TaxCut said it e-filed successfully, but 8 months later I received a letter from the IRS stating they never got my return.  I checked and found several other people who have had e-filing problems with TaxCut so tried TurboTax instead.

I found the 2012 TurboTax user interface to be much more intuitive than TaxCut's interface.  The auto import feature is fantastic and seemed to import my fincancial information correctly.  This saved me a lot of time and is greatly appreciated.  Hopefully it will e-file correctly or at least let me know if it does not.  So far I am happy with TurboTax."
The best game on the market for children in our opinion...all of them.
"This is a very deceptive package . The picture of a VHS video converter system depicted on the package is not what is in the box,sold to me. .
Yes, your return window has closed,and I may not return the RCA cables encased in the package delivered to me. I will never forget such a
deceptive scam. This  will be made known to all I know that may need to purchase this product."
"Excellent software. I performing as advertised and reviewed. It has stopped several virus's, with nothing getting through. My computer continues to work very fast and I think it is in part because of the great job this software is doing."
"it is A Good product. original, it was on time, and works great for me, it really like to me!!!"
Perfect!!!
"So far I haven't come across any major problems, it's easy to use and similar enough to win 7 where I don't get confused. I did install a 3rd party plugin to create a start menu button."
"I had Quicken 2011 and was FORCED to upgrade to 2014 version, as the old version would not sych with my bank any more. Buying products from Quicken/Intuit is like purchasing skin medication for athlete's foot. It works fine, but you sure don't want to do it. The old version was working just fine, but Intuit locks you out after 3 years so they can make more money!"
"Thought this product would bridge my Mac......Just tons of headaches.

Basically worthless"
"It's my fault that I didn't read the products description well enough. While I DO have a floppy drive I don't have any disks left. Without 'floppies' this disk WON'T WORK, so don't waste your money."
"I bought my Sync based on the Consumer Reports guide stating it to be one of the best phones that AT&T Wireless has to offer and comparing it to other phones on other carriers, it ranks at the top 3.  However, neither Samsung nor anyone else has data synchronization capabilities for Mac, which I knew going in but based my decision on the fact that DataPilot supported Mac and the SGH-A707.  After I got the product and downloaded any updates, I still have not been able to synchronize my phone.  For future reference, I will no longer buy a software product that doesn't allow me to download a trial version!

The claim that they have all these wonderful USB cables to connect to this huge array of phones is a fallacy.  There's supposed to be an iPod cable in this kit and I have to say that it does actually fit my iPod but it doesn't properly charge my iPod and DataPilot will not detect my iPod.

At this point in time, I have a totally useless set of software and cables and have no confidence in this company at all to deliver what they say they deliver.  Highly disappointed!"
Importing recipes is easy and fast. It does everything it should. It is not 100% intuitive but does not take much effort to learn the few simple processes needed.
"I have spent hundreds of dollars and dozens of hours messing around with digital media players trying to create a Digital Sign.  Until I found the DSS media player it seemed like the only options were over $500, bulky and overkill, or $59 junk that just didn't do what I needed it to do and broke down heavy use.  This media player just works. I can create and upload new images and RRS feeds to play in my store even when I am at home and it uploads instantly.  The little thing runs 12 hours a day and has no problems."
The key worked fine to install Windows 10 on my MacBook Pro. Got the code in about an hour. This seller is awesome. Thanks.
Didn't really offer much in new functionality that I could use. I just like to stay current in releases.
"Features are good, but it locks up occasionally, requiring a couple windows processes to be killed and then Quicken 2015 premier can be reopened.  Very frustrating, but when it works, the features are good."
"I like quicken especially the stock/fund updates that is displayed one screen.  However, after a few years, that feature is disabled and you would have to buy the more resent version to get the feature back. So, I stopped using the software and track on line from one of my financial websites."
"The capabilities of this software are incredibly good. It approaches professional videographer level.  Things to be cautious about: 1) The software is extremely sophisticated and there is a steep learning curve. 2) This is heavy-duty software. It's not for the average PC. If you do not have a machine specially designed for speed, it will bring your computer to its knees."
"Software works well but I bought this since it said Vegas but alas it is the much less powerful movie studio version.  Good program for beginners, lots of features just not all Vegas has to offer."
Downloaded to my computer and it was ready to rock! Decent price too. Thanks
So far this is working like a champ.  Feel much safer than with McAfee or Windows Defender.
"This is a terrible update.  The lay out is confusing. Information has been lost, simple procedures like online services are buried and not right at hand, even income and expenses have been made less intuitive."
"MyLogoMaker software was a huge disappointment! There are very few options for logo templates, and the ones offered are very basic. They had few categories to choose from, and very few options within each category. [...]."
Good product if you cannot afford the paid version of antivirus software.
"We use Turbo Tax every year, but were disappointed that we had to buy the Premier edition to get the federal forms we needed to file this year."
Great office software! Beenj using it for years and have never been disappointed.
"I have been using Quickbooks for my business for the past 12 years or so.  Each year when a new updated version comes out, I'm first in line to get it on my computer.  It's easy to cost average any type of business, from a hot dog vendor to a Fortune 500 company. The multiple types of reports you can run is amazing. And if you hit a snag, phone support is the best."
Fast delivery.. Can't wait to use
I recomend this vendor to everyone.  We had a slight misunderstanding about what the product was.  This vendor gave me a prompt refund.  If all vendors were this cool I would do alot more on-line shopping.
good easy to use
A very nice program - easy to setup and use.  I have it on my pc and my tablet.
"Have just completely wasted my money on this product in search of a more accurate masking solution. I am not a Photoshop user, but I do have Corel PhotoPaintx4 (14.0) and PaintShop Pro 10. Despite what you may find in Corel user groups, Knockout DOES NOT work with any of these. Called Corel Support and was told it only works with certain versions of Photoshop. The box and the instructions say it will work with PhotoPaint, but apparently this is only up to CorelDraw v. 11. It will only work with Photoshop 5,6, and 7 as well. They tell me that they no longer make the product and it is all old stock, so that's why the manual and packaging are incorrect. Needless to say they won't take it back for a refund. This is another fine example of the disgusting customer service I have become accustomed to from Corel, and is probably contravening consumer law in the UK. If you have one of the aforementioned versions of Photoshop, it may work very well. Otherwise forget it."
"I got this for my computer,,since it had good rep here and PC mags. Today while webroot was running somehow this spyware called System Tools installed itself on my laptop and blocked me from doing anything and shut all active tasks on system tray including WEBROOT(very disappointed). I tried many things to get my laptop to get back to being normal, instead I had this stupid Danger message on my Desktop and all administrator function has been disabled. WEBROOT did nothing for me. I installed Norton which was provided by my ISP for free by using a mix of safe mode and last known good config. I don't know how I was able to install Norton and update it. Restarted my PC,,it came to desktop and again the same danger message with norton installed,,but here is the Deal maker with Norton,,while the Spyware closed everything again including WEBROOT(VERY VERY VERY DISSAPOINTED)it could not shut down Norton and after few minutes Norton has this thing called Sonar it detected this jerk of a Spyware and was able to shut it down, and then it gave me a way to delete this System Tool Spyware. Webroot is Ok but I will not buy it again and I am sticking with Norton this year. I did like the ease of use with WEBROOT,,but if a spyware can just install itself while webroot is running,,that is very disappointing. I would not recommend anyone to buy webroot."
"Great Operating System, I prefer this to Windows 8"
"Tried to install NIS 2006 after removing an earlier version, kept getting a message about aborting the new installation because ""variants"" of an earlier symantec product were detected.

Spent most of the day trying to track down the problem, including 2 sessions with their ""engineers"" who were obviously reading scripted material.  Doesn't bother me that they were in India or wherever, they were just clueless - full of heartfelt sympathy, but no help.  Downloaded a variety of symantec's ""clean out"" tools,supposedly made to address this very problem, all of which aborted.  If you spend 50 bucks on a bad meal in a restaurant, you avoid the place and move on.  Same thing here.  This is a product that can't get out of its own way, and should be avoided."
Sold many investment properties last year and it handled it like a pro.

PROS: Seamless backup to desktop Quicken; useful budget feature; integrated calculator.
CONS: No uncategorized items permitted in split transactions; inability to edit (on handheld) any transaction backed up to desktop Quicken; quirky installation procedure.
Like many others, a determining factor in purchasing a handheld organiser was the potential of managing my finances `on the go'. With so many poor reviews of Pocket Quicken 1.0, it was an easy decision to go with Pocket Money, which worked well. The missing piece was easy backup and importing to the desktop version of Intuit Quicken or Microsoft Money.
Quicken can import a .qif file (containing several accounts) generated from Pocket Money. The trouble I had was importing transfer transactions: they were duplicated and/or adjusted, requiring re-reconciliation. To work with Microsoft Money, you had to create a .qif file for every account in Pocket Money. Quickly annoying with over 20 accounts, required on every synchronisation.
Pocket Quicken 2.0 does what it claims here: flawless synchronisation between handheld and desktop. However, it is one-way only; once transactions are uploaded to the desktop, you can't edit them on the handheld.
Worse, every cent/pence must be assigned to a category in Pocket Quicken. Do the programmers at LandWare not use cash? You withdraw cash from an ATM/hole-in-the-wall; you spend some of it now, some of it later. Well, if you record the transaction in Pocket Quicken, you either have to (a) wait until it is all spent before entering appropriate categories in your split transaction, or (b) enter the split transaction with a large segment categorised as `Misc', then constantly adjust this figure as you spent the rest of the cash. At least on desktop Quicken you can override the `uncategorised items' warning. Sort this out quick, please.
The installation procedure is also quirky. Here is how I managed it: (1) Install desktop Quicken. NB: Set-up password (go to File: Passwords: File); (2) Install Pocket Quicken; (3) Conduct first Palm synchronisation; (4) Open Pocket Quicken; (5) Enter desktop Quicken password in box `Quicken File Password' (leave `Launch PIN' = `-Unassigned-` unless you desire a PIN for Pocket Quicken); (6) Conduct second Palm synchronisation; (7) NB: Conduct future Palm synchronisation with desktop Quicken CLOSED.
Not all is bad news. Pocket Quicken's budget feature is competitively unique, and I find it very useful. Yet if the folks at LandWare can manage to synchronise category lists, why not budgets?
The integrated calculator is a convenient piece of programming. Just wish as much thought went into the rest of the package.
Overall, Pocket Quicken 2.0 is undoubtedly an improvement over version 1.0. Its (one-way) synchronisation is truly seamless, and its budget feature is unmatched. However, major improvements are still required. In the end, I could justify the purchase, with my many accounts and long transaction history. Though I expect some free upgrades from LandWare. I have to say, if you only rely on your handheld, then Pocket Money is likely to be a better experience."
"I've been working for a print shop for around three years now, and have been doing computer aided design work for about 7 years now and I must say that Quark is simply the best in desktop publishing software there is, well worth the extra money over PageMaker, InDesign, and the very very sad Publisher.
Sure, Quark isn't quite as friendly as PageMaker, but there is a reason for that.  Quark works on logic as opposed to trying to be ""friendly"".  Quark was obviously designed by people who were actually layout artists before the days of computerized design, and it shows.  The layout looks exactly like what you would see on an old mock-up.
Granted this means you have to know a bit about layout and design, but you get much better results, and the pre press department at the printer will love you if you use Quark correctly.  PageMaker and InDesign are clunky and a bit obnoxious to deal with.
Our shops usual response to someone asking what program to use it ""Find someone to design it for you in Quark"".  It's not a tool for someone to run out and buy if they don't know what they are doing, but it's deffinately the tool to use for professional results."
"So I had to buy this because its a Todd Rundgren Creation. It only runs on the Old OS 8 OS 9 of Mac, but still its quite interesting to see how Todd built the recordings and how you can re-edit the songs. The interface is a bit of a learning curve but we have moved so much further with technology today. If he was to build another project this this today it would be much more robust."
Wow!  What a step up from my 10 year old photo program (which I will still use).  It's going to be a steep learning curve but it's going to be a lot of fun.  Someday when I get good at this it will be my go-to program for photo editing.
"We have an old Garmin with the SD slot. I didn't want to pay a fortune for new maps, so I went with this and it works perfectly. Came very quickly too (within 2 days). I didn't quite get the mini SD in the adaptor right the first time, but once I did it worked great."
"When my old computer gave up the ghost and crashed I lost 10 years of research on my family roots. I had backup cds but they were from a previous version of FTM. After several conversations with the FTM tech folks. they assured me that the new FTM 16 would do the job for me.

After I loaded FTM 16 with a patch for MS vista, which I received from FTM forum, the backup disk loaded the data flawlessly. I am quite happy with this new program & the speed it arrived from Amazon.com .

Just what I expected
"This is a brilliant piece of instructional software design.

I was shocked at the quality delivered versus the price paid. The format makes it easy to pick up and remember phrases and words in a manner that it is never tedious and even kind of fun.

Perfect for the tourist who wants learn how to get by.  Sure beats paying $300 for Rosetta Stone."
It's still running on my iMac weekly.  Sometimes the auto mode scan doesn't work and I have to run it manually.
"It is OK, I guess."
"I have been using Quicken for years and without it my business and banking recordes would be a mess, it also makes tax time a snap. Thank you Quicken for all your great products."
everything WORKED OUT OK
love it
"This isn't top of the line, but just what i needed to keep track of my spending and banking. I use it everyday!"

I have been a quicken user for many years 20+.  I had 2008 and was very leary to upgrade to the new 2014.  I did and now I am not sure I should have.  Quicken has a lot of work to do to keep my confidence with there product.  They need to deal with the freeze ups and speed when registering purchases into the register for each account.  I am hoping they can do some updating to fix the issues.
This was an upgrade from Windows 7 Starter to Windows 7 Home Premium on a Dell Inspiron Netbook.  the upgradr performed flawlessly.
"I've had this disc for 10 years.  I recently noticed that the Microsoft version of Klondike called Solitaire has a poor random deal generator.  I spotted repeating patterns after playing a few dozen games.  So I dug out my Ultimate Solitaire by Valusoft and began playing Klondike.  Within a few dozen games I again spotted repeating patterns.  I am guessing but I think both Microsoft and Valusoft use a random number generator in the operating system and either neither of them know how to increase the randomness or neither company knows how to write its own random number generator.  I suspect that all of Valusoft's solitaire games use the same random number generator, thus all of the games suffer from the same lack of random shuffles of the cards.  The games are fun but don't expect the shuffles to ""always"" give you a different game.  But there are a lot of games and it will take you a long time to try them all.

Do not buy. Rip off
"excellent service, product was as- described- new in the pkg. Would purchase from this seller again."
Installed in one afternoon and wrote up a flyer with imported pictures same day -- it was very easy!
Well worth the money!
"I think this program deserves at least 4 stars,but i noticed it only has 2.5 in your advertisement,so i gave it 5 stars to bring up the average. Very easy to use,a great interface that jumps right out at you,and lots of help.couldn't be happier with it."
"Attention!! It doesn't work with later versions of Mac OS!! After trying all settings possible with no success to make it work with my Mac OS Sierra, I managed to reach customer service for help. Here is their answer:  Thank you for contacting Corel Technical Support.
My name is xxxxxxxx and I have been assigned to your ticket. I understand that you are having an issue with the program. Regarding your concern, the issue you are having might be due to the compatibility of the program to the operating system. The program has not received any updates since Mac OS 10.6 and is not compatible with Mac OS Sierra and El Capitan.
Please do not hesitate to contact us with any further questions.
Regards,
xxxxxxxx
Corel Technical Support Services  (FINALLY I GOT MY MONEY BACK BUT, AS ALL MAC USERS UPDATES THEIR OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS ON A REGULAR BASIS, IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT ROXIO KEEPS THIS TOTALLY OBSOLETE PRODUCT IN THEIR PORTFOLIO!!!"
"I am using Wordperfect for over 15 years. In spite of the fact that my notebook came with a free limited version of Microsoft Office, I am still convinced that WordPerfect Office is the better option. And once again the update (from Version X3 to X5) just went as smooth as possible."
"Already have a Garmin and my original data set was loaded by retailer.  So I was a bit confused about how to load data from disc initially, but after a quick response through Garmin's service group I was up and running."
"I have Google Crome. Did not load with Crome. I had to load this from internet explorer with cookies on. Once loaded worked fine with both Crome and internet explorer cookies off. Also, I had used McAfee in the past. So, I also had to log in first as well. Once, I got past the download. All is good."
Great Software. I was able to transfer all my daughter's videos to an SD card for her Leapfrog Tablet. This software allowed me to remove the promo programs and to merge all episodes so it plays all the episodes together.
Did not Download.
Constant issues.  The widget is completely unusable.  It consistently locks my phone to the point I have to remove the battery or sit there while music continues to play being unable to do anything including restarting or shutting down the phone until the app figures out something went wrong and I get an error message.  This usually take a couple of minutes.  I get consistent play back errors using the app.
"Ive been meaning to convert my old VHS and camcorder tapes and wanted to make sure that someone could help me if I ran into any problems since I have no experience in any of this.  I was a little hesitant at first after reading some of the reviews but decided to give this product a try anyway because they seem to be the only one I found to have customer support and people who used their older products seem to like them.  I ran into some problems at first when I couldn't see anything on my PC so I called the customer support and they walked me through the whole thing.  It turned out that I just connected the cables wrong.  I felt a little embarrassed but the guy I talked to was very patient and nice, and even made sure everything worked fine before getting of the phone.  Other than the glitch at the beginning, Im actually surprised by how easy it was to use!  I even tried to edit a little using their more advanced mode.  Im definitely glad that I got this product and would recommend it to others like me."
"Message in Quicken 20111 said I HAD to upgrade from Quicken 2011 by April 30 or I could no longer download banking transactions. I purchased the ""upgrade"" and it has crashed 7 times today trying to use it. As a long an loyal user, I am very disappointed. Quicken 2014 is not ready to trust with you banking data.

Looking to re-install Quicken 2011 and manually download the bank data files. Far from an upgrade. Tried it on both Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 all with the latest patches and the same result."
"FYI: Im a retired computer programmer of both mainframes and PCs. Not a computer novice.

Ive been a True Image user since version 2008. Since then Ive upgraded and used the following versions: 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2014.

I always I felt the interface was user unfriendly. When 2014 came out I thought, maybe the interface is improved so I purchased the upgrade and have been frustrated ever since. In my opinion 2014 is the worst interface yet. Terrible! In fact, I finally gave up and went back to using version 2011.

I requested a refund for my 2014 but Acronis said I took too long to determine that the new version was the worst yet. I only backup once every month so I exceeded the 30 days. Fair enough but is that good customer support? You decide.

My advice is the same as many others here. Avoid this like the plague and don't even think of upgrading if you already have an older version."
Great... Just what I expected!
"A great program. I'm working on a BS and MS in Criminal Justice. The program is for high school studnets, but I'm finding that I can use Encarta and other parts of the program. I can use. Mircosoft should make a Student 2006 for college students or make teh current program designed for both high school and college students."
"the best app for sketch in pads, I use it in Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2, the best app works for me."
Well I'm impressed:)  I'd inadvertently bought this for a MAC when I'm running windows.  Left a low review and Webroot Support contacted me in less than 24 hours with a fix.  Lesson for me is to READ a bit more about what I'm buying and hopefully WEBROOT will put OS in bigger letters for dummies like me!  Thx for the fix!!
Loaded perfectly.
"have been trialing this product for about 3 weeks now and am sorely disappointed in the klunkiness of the features: 1.minor, but can not delete the cutsy sampler from the video library. 2.the transitions I have tried are not smoothly integrated into the clips and the big 3. chokes on dv-avi files and even more compressed standard compressions. would I repurchase this product? NO"
"This is one of the best computer games that my son has ever played.  He can't get enough of it.  He's just starting kindergarten, so many of the activities in the game reinforce what he is learning in school.  Don't pass this game up!  I actually enjoy playing it with him, and not many games suitable for his age can fit that claim."
"Fast, convenient buy.  I was expecting a hard copy but its easy to make a copy so its all gud"
great
It's great!
Did not work on my computer.
"I too am grossly disappointed with Windows 10...It is like a wolf in disguise.  Microsoft have tried to bring back Windows 7, but in doing so, have added useless components such as Cortina, and taken away valued components such as the Windows Media Center.  It appears that Microsoft, are trying to get into the mobile, gaming, and tablet markets at the expense of a very good operating system...namely Windows 7.
Going beyond all the all the yipe that Microsoft have pushed into getting people to use Windows 10, when it boils down to the nitty-grittiys of using Windows 10, users just cannot do some of the operations that were readily available in Windows 7."
"Hero Lab is a great program for creating role playing characters. The system has tremendous flexibility for adding stats, gear, spells, and talents/skills unique to the game system you choose. But that choice is the one major ""con"" for this product - while the package and product description tout all of the different systems you can use (d20/3.5, pathfinder, D&D 4.0, etc.), you only get to choose ONE product with the included license and everything else costs additional money.

So if you are playing both 3.5 and 4.0 D&D, you will buy the product and at least another $20 in license fees. And Pathfinder is the worst of them all - every additional hardcover book (like the Advanced Player's Guide or the Beastiaries) costs anywhere from $10 to $20 extra to add to your Pathfinder license.

The verification process is a great feature that draws your attention to everything required to ""complete"" the character, such as adding feats when you have leveled.

If you do not play multiple systems or need the add-ons, Hero Lab is a great deal and I heavily recommend it to any RPers who want character generation/printing ease. Just be aware you will probably spend more than the purchase price in additional license fees."
worked great
"I switched from TurboTax because I'm tired of the price hikes.  HR Block wouldn't update or e-file unless I turned off windows firewall.  When doing taxes the search mode found no results for things that are clearly in the tax program...1099, 1040, etc... When printing State Tax for mailing it didn't print all needed forms despite the instructions stating all required forms would print.  I needed to include federal form 1040 Schedule A.  Choosing to print that form alone printed a blank form with no entries.  I had to print the entire 1040 to get a copy of the schedule A. Other than these issues it worked OK and I completed my taxes."
"I've been using Quick Books Pro and Enhanced payroll for many years now and am very satisfied with the product.  It is user friendly, does what I need it to do, and I would highly recommend it!"
"I've been using TurboTax for about 5 years (and Quicken since its first version), and this version is the best ever.  I'm amazed at the changes since last year, and the simplicity of doing my taxes this way.

ItsDeductible is a big bonus, if you itemize deductions.  I use it throughout the year to track both cash donations, and donations of ""stuff.""  At tax time, it's so simple to import the data and watch the effect on the final taxes.

Did you know that you can use one license for everyone in your household?  Unless you e-file, there are no additional fees for additional returns prepared with TurboTax.

Overall, TurboTax is brilliant and simple.  It's actually fun to prepare your taxes!"
My computer died and had to buy another Microsoft Works.  It was a lifesaver and was able to find the missed items I had lost.
"I work as a tech support rep for an online Independent Study website. We have found that problems with Norton Internet Security software are so common that one of the first questions we ask users experiencing any problems is if they have Norton Internet Security. Their script blocking can actually comment out an entire page to block harmless scripts. The popup blocking does not allow any easy override command, and even popups that are a direct result of clicking are blocked.

 Unfortunately, it seems that the only way to stop any ""features"" that you do not like is to disable the entire program. Symantec's support system is extremely lacking, as I've spent a total of three hours searching for an acceptable solution and waiting on hold.

 Please save us tech support people (and, of course, yourselves) time. Do not purchase this product."
"I ordered this many years ago
I don't remember it at all"
"I bought the 06 version and loved it.
I downloaded the trial version for 08 to see if it is worth the new price, afterall, I bought the 06 just not so long ago (maybe less than 3 months).
The new Numbers and Pages are just wonderful.  It is so much more intuitive than MS Office.  I have the Office for Mac and I have been using Office in Windows for the past 10 years.  But ever since I started using Pages and Keynote, and now Numbers, I have to say hands down, iWork 08 is near perfection for 99.9% of all office needs.
I wish there were even more templates for all three apps.  But with the included templates, one could modify them to create new templates fairly easy and quick.
My trial period is coming to an end in a couple of weeks.  I will buy the iWork 08 for sure."
"Except for a few loading issues on Windows 10 I would have given this a 5 star rating.  One error message said that it could not load a file because it already existed (so what?) and I skipped that issue.  A second issue involved the on-line registration which indicated that my machine was not connected to the internet which it was.  These little set-up problems out of the way I tried to capture a video.  No problem.  It is really quite simple and the 30 odd page manual is a big improvement over the Dazzle one of 300 pages which is on its way back.  Thank you Amazon.  Dazzle is made by a company noted for video editing and did not separate themselves from that genre long enough to provide a no frills user friendly approach to transferring a vcr video onto a dvd or onto one's computer.  Dazzle would do well to consider a quick start guide similar to the one everyone else uses.  If one is interested in serious video editing it will probably require a dedicated program.  For the simple conversion, this is the best one available."
Needed it
"I assumed (incorrectly) that this was the same item as sold on the Rosetta website, but for 49.00 cheaper. It is not. It does not include the audio companion, which was one of the main reasons I purchased due to long commutes.

I had to call Rosetta Stone (cannot order seperately on-line, must go through sales via phone) and paid $55.00 for it. I therefore spent more with Amazon, not less as they advertise (they are doing a price comparison with Rosetta Stone, but not comparing the same products!) and had to wait several weeks and go through a lot of trouble just to get what I could have gotten for less with an actual guarantee through the website. Don't buy from Amazon - go through Rosetta Stone!"
"While this software installed easily on my iMacG5, the map data CD's zoom and travel very slowly.  Also no roads are named and routing is rudimentary at best.  My dvd rom also burnt the yellow dye off the first data CD I put in the machine.  None of these things has ever happened with my other mapping software.  One could get better and more detailed mapping info online for free than with this.  Finally, when the zoom is eventually accomplished, it is not at a very close scale.  All in all, a very disappointing product."
I love is app.
Legit.
"This software will not install on Windows 7 64 bit machines. Keep stalling with a .NET error asking for .NET 3.5 even though Windows has .NET 4.0 I tried it on 3 machines, all running Win 7 64, and the same error happened. Windows 7 64 will not allow you to install .NET 3.5 which this software requires so you will never get it running. Emailed their support and was offered Ver. 23.1 as a replacement for this KNOWN ISSUE. I bought this as a gift for my sister who liked the older version she had and due to the install issues had to return it. Complete fail for this company given the number of Windows 7 64 bit computers there are out there."
"This is my second year using this. Easy to use on my all my computers. OS I have it on is XP, VISTA and 8.1. Very easy to update/renew. Just enter the new number. The days of un-install/re-install are gone. I've used several brands of AV, Norton 360 has been very easy to use and maintain."
This is all I use for security on my computer. Its all Ive used for years. Its great for scanning for viruses and malware. Its got a lot of great features to keep your computer clean from hackers. I suggest it to anyone that likes a safe computer. It also has cell phone features that keeps your cell clean.
I received it on time and did what it was supposed to do.
"Not any better then 2013 version. Never have liked the budget user experience. Had trouble after I set up a bank account of it only working for a few weeks and suddenly it would not connect, etc.  Deleted the account and set it up again, it's working now, for how long? Note.. Used the reset account and it did nothing"
"I purchased directly from Aiseesoft.  Completely unreliable -- sometimes works, mostly doesn't.  Last straw was when it would not eject disc and no Mac commands would eject it either.  I will have to remove the player from my MacBook to get it out.  MacWorld, whose review I relied upon should be ashamed to have endorsed this product with a glowing review."

I thought I was pretty good with computer programs but this one is really tough to learn. Of course any one can do it but be prepared to spend a couple of full days.

My take is that they should have used the system that Microsoft or Apple uses to make a program easy to use. For instance they could have a much more logical menu system and the controls could be more in line with other such software. Instead they chose to create a foriegn system that requires a lot of time to learn. But, when you get it, you got it!

Otherwise it is a very comprehensive program that with some additional (and expensive) add on's make the program very useful for travelers. As a stand alone it is not worth the money."
Works as advertised and easy to use
"McAfee firewall puts out its fair share of false alarms.
I would recommend Tiny Software Personal Firewall over this product."
"Great program just have to learn how to use all the functions.

They fixed the problem with the elements program constantly working on pictures using most of the CPU time."
"I had used Living Language's NOOK tablet app, which opened my eyes to just how helpful computer-based language learning could be. I also tried Rosetta's app. As I researched available systems, I discovered Rocket Languages Chinese (Mandarin). After only a few weeks' study, using Rocket Chinese, I was able to greet,and exchange pleasantries with ,Dr Paul Lam,in his native Mandarin! He even complimented me on my correct use of tones, then asked how I learned. Of course, I was thrilled to tell him about Rocket Chinese. The Rocket Chinese course really brings the language alive ;while allowing the learner to progress at their own pace. I wish the Premium Plus level had more exposition of grammar; but overall, Rocket Languages provides unbeatable ""bang-for-your-buck"". Using Rocket Chinese, I have reached a level where I can now start to use more- traditional, book based grammars,and make sense of the material- whereas, before , the books were just mute, and cryptic, and I just was not absorbing the lessons. Rocket is the way to go!

"It is buggy. It crashes on Windows 7 SP1, it crashes on Windows 8.1.  I have 96 GB of ram, SSD drives, SATA III drives on the Windows 7 box, I have tried it on both drive types and it crashes incessantly.  The Windows 8.1 box is a standard 12GB 1TB machine and no luck there either. Having a 64 bit program is sweet, having one that doesn't work isn't. I can't do a proper review because I can't get it to stay running long enough to do anything on either machine.  I have Premier Elements running on both machines as well as Premier Pro with no problems. I give it two stars for the free tracks, myriad presets, and free training...if they get it patched and working it could be a much better rated program.  However, for now I don't have the time to bother with it or Corel's lackluster support (long time Painter user and former Word Perfect user...so I know their support)."
Did what it should do.
Nice program. I have old VHS tapes of my children when they were very young. It would have been a terrible loss when the tapes begin to disengrate and all those memories would have been lost. Now I have begun to preserve them on DVD's for years to come. The product is easy to use and does exactly what it says. I would recommend this program as a great way to transfer information from the old VHS technology to an updated DVD format.
Works great so far on all my devices.
"My computer has Windows XP Pro, as an operating system and I have had no luck getting the Norton Internet Security software to function properly.  So What do you do?  You call customer support, and who answers the phone, somebody who cannot speak ledgable english.

As best you can, you follow the instruction given, and no dice. The software does not function, as claimed.

Next move you call again, and same old story.  The Tech cannot speak ledgable english, no way to e - mail Norton, and you are stuck.

So you call Microsoft,and ask if their operating system is  compatable with Norton Internet Security?  Again you get someone who barely speaks english.

You go on line as instructed by the error notice on the screen, print out the instructions and you tinker, according to instructions, and once you are done, same problem.

If you deceide to buy this software ask a million and one questions, and make sure you get the right answers before you plop that cash down on the counter.  Ask for a money back guarantee, and if you are refused, keep going."
"I have purchased Norton 360 and it worked fine.  However, when I had a support issue, I was in hold purgatory.  I hung up after waiting an hour and 23 minutes and still no help.  You would have to be stupid to purchase a product from Symantec.  It is time for a different product."
"Can only use it with operating system ""Windows Vista"" and prior."
"I have always extolled the virtues of McAfee VirusScan. I say this in the past tense because the latest version of McAfee has enough bugs of its own to make a getting a virus almost attractive by comparison. I have spent a great deal of time on their online technical support. Here's just one example: Windows/Temp/Zip files send it for a loop -- literally. It sits there and scans the same Temporary Zip files, over and over and over again. You have to abort the scan, which kind of defeats the purpose of performing a system scan.
Considering that it has captured 5 computer viruses in my email inbox this week alone, VirusScan is still a worthwhile program; I just hate to see Network Associates join the other big software companies in marketing annoying software that is not yet ready for prime time."
"QB has some downloading and integration issues with your bank downloads.  They have yet to resolve them and have a quite arrogant attitude. ""We'll let you know when we fix it.  Just give us your email.""  That is not acceptable.

If you want to use the bank downloads, you will have to manually enter everything to be sure you get it right.  Don't buy the updated version until this is fixed.

2016/May
Just got an update from QB.  Classic QB [BS].  And they're not going to fix their program!  Nor are they offering any other assistance.  The fix ""May be available"" at some future time.  Someday there will be real competition for QB and we'll be rid of them.

Painless purchase.
"Since they have gotten away from supplying any discs when you buy a new system, it really helps to have this particular disc on hand for back-up."
"Very cheap, very efficient program!"
"This is your standard turobtax allowing itemized deduction. For federal, it's fairly brainless and quick for e-file. However, when I got the state, they would charge you 20$ to e-file for state. Even more, if you choose to use some of your federal refund to pay for that, they charge you another 20 for processing. That's a bit, ridiculous. I opted out e-filing, just filed it on the state's website, took like 5 minutes."
Great Product
excellent quality and service
"We had been using QB 2004 Pro for several years.  When Intuit threatened to withdraw all support for the product in March of 2007, we decided to upgrade.  The new version has a few convenience features (that have been in Quicken for years) like remembering the account a particular bill goes to, but in general it's just a very expensive cosmetic upgrade.  I wish the company would quit trying to force a new product out every year, and put one out when they've really got an improvement."
"Webroot is top of the line virus protector, with a security program that is worth paying for. It also optimizes your pc to clean out garbage and infected files. I would recommend webroot to anyone if you want your pc secure."
Works great!
"As a laptop/desktop user of windows for 15 years, I find the new user interface too focused on touch screen.  The latest updates are making it better.  Windows 9 will hopefully give us oldsters something a little more practical.  I get around the lack of a convenient list of PC type apps by putting shortcut and shortcut folders on my tasklist and desktop.  Had to do this for my parents also and teach them how to get away from the tablet interface when they stumble upon it (inevitable this happens as you use it).

On a positive note, it is very stable on a wide variety of my desktops/laptops.  I have it on a 3 year old knockoff laptop from china, a home media server with all the bells and whistles, and a brand new mini desktop from Lenovo (all built to my specifications and not as a standard configuration from the manufacturer)"
"Do not buy this software.  Their website will not let me register my software and they have locked the program because it's not registered.  When I call to have them fix it, they want me to pay for tech support.  They are now holding my tax information in the program hostage until I pay for tech support.  Avoid this company at all cost!!!!!"
"I have been using Quicken for years and have learned that new is not always better.  The last update to 2011 gave me a fairly stable program although its validation process continues to yield issues, regardless of the fact that the ""problems"" it recognizes are because of reconciled transactions NOT carried over on a year end copy.

Along comes 2012.  I admit, I am an early adopter, expecting (naively so) a better product than the one it replaces.  Little did I realize that the new product would stink.  I have been doing online banking and online bookkeeping for years, all the way back to the early days of Tobias Managing Your Money.

Simply put, DO NOT BUY THIS PROGRAM.  It is not ready for prime time and errors galore.  Updating one's portfolio is so filled with bugs that it is a guarantee to cause entry errors.

Some examples.  I have six different accounts.  Yes it goes online and updates each.  However, press the ""accept"" button leads to a dead end and doesn't take you to the next transaction.  It also doesn't know when all transactions are complete for the downloaded account.  The workaround is clicking on an earlier transaction on the transaction list and going back to enter the next transaction and so on.

It also keeps downloading with EVERY portfolio transaction ""Splits"" that I have already taken care of and no matter how many times I try to eliminate it, it comes back with each successive download.  Finally I accepted the download and had to find where it inserted the splits deep in the bowels of the transactions and eliminate my entered one and left theirs, a tiresome and potentially error ridden process.

It is clearly slower than 2011, providing NO benefit and nothing but additional hassles.

This is the first time I have ever done this, BUT, I got a refund and am have gone back to 2011.

Needless to say, Intuit released a piece of crap with this one."
Do not buy
I paid for it & tried to download it but it does not open & work on my PC How do I get my money back?
I paid 14.99  because it was a sale on Amazon but is was not worth the sale price. I downloaded the game and the number that you have to enter in after you have downloaded the software to prove that you have bought the game did not work. The only thing that I happy about this purchase is that Amazon refunded my money back.
did not work
"You really need to own the latest version for it to work. I bought version 7, and it doesn't work for anything I've tried so far. When I checked the website I realized that the current version is 12. Oops. Now I'll have to pay more money to upgrade."
Seem to have cleaned up Office 2013 to make it look better and it seem more stable as well so far.
"As many Adobe CS3 and CS4 users reported when this update came out in 2009, there are major compatibility issues.  At the time, Adobe assured users that CS3 would work fine (although they discontinued support) and that CS4 was designed to work with Snow Leopard.  From my experience with CS3, I have to say that none of this was true.

I've experienced multiple crashes while using CS3 Photoshop under Snow Leopard, especially when trying to use the ""Place"" command.

Also experienced a crash on CS3 Illustrator and CS3 Dreamweaver, although I could not reproduce crash.

Snow Leopard is also buggy when using Flash Player on Firefox.  Experienced multiple crashes here, even after updating plug-ins.

Otherwise, Snow Leopard has had no major effect on my system, which seems slightly faster.  No major bells and whistles added."
"FYI...  Copernic was sold sometime ago, and all development was frozen.  The last version was/is 3.4, and hasn't been updated since long before July of 2010.  As far as anyone knows, there will be no further development on this, or other, Copernic products."
"I bought this on impulse at a Toys 'R Us in Ottawa while on a care trip, so I may have a Canadian edition. First, the upside: my 3-year-old likes it. The art is nice. The downside: The program is supposed to remember progress from session to session. It doesn't. And the songs included, which were supposed to match the songs in the juke box, were not the same songs and were in Dutch. (I guess someone at Simon & Schuster Interactive grabbed the wrong file when it was time to burn the masterCD-ROM!) The space game is a thinly disguised version of Space Invaders. Even though George is recruited to ""collect"" shapes from asteroids, my son immediately referred to shooting at the asteriods as ""killing"" them. And in no time, my son was yelling ""Kill, kill, kill!"" as he played it. I don't think that was supposed to happen. The puzzle game works, but it is just wooden puzzles as software. The juke box game didn't work too well for my son because he liked to give the ""wrong"" answers because they were funnier."
"Easy to use, easy to learn software. Has worked flawlessly for me so far."
"I was so thrilled to convert by VHS tapes to DVD until I discovered that even my 80 gig hard drive was not enough for a 20 minute video AND once I had the AVI video and tried to burn the DVD the software said I had to go to dazzle.com to PURCHASE a $100 upgrade. The hardware and bundle only cost $40! There is no tech support effective 10/24/03 for any Dazzle DVC 80 Movie Star v. 5. Therefore, you use up your hard drive and can't off load it anyway. What a waste! You have to delete the capture that took you 5 hours to produce. LOSER!"
"Love it, Even I can look great!  Easy to use, fun to play with.  Beautiful function, but don't over do it."
The best
"No problems with installation using this key card.  Love the discount over regular download.  I plan on weighing options for different product in a year, so I don't mind the yearly subscription avaiable for 5 computers."
"I purchased this screen saver pack hoping that I'd be able to import the pictures into my current screen saver software, WebShots. However, Second Nature has created a similar screen saver program and the pictures are saved in a proprietary format. Therefore, you either use the screen saver program provided or say 'Bye bye' to your investment. Second Nature offers 1000s more pictures at a website, similar to WebShots. Unfortunately, I'm too vested in my current program to begin anew.
Also, the resolution of the photos doesn't hold when your display is set to 1280x1024.  Most of the photos are blurry.  Perhaps at 800x600?"
"I like this product because Norton is well-respected in the industry, and Amazon offered at a very affordable price.  Don't be home without it!"
"I tried H&R Block in 2010, TurboTax in 2011 and then H&R Block again in 2012.

H&R Pros

Significantly less glitch prone than 2010 Software
Easy Step By Step ""in plain English"" instructions for most sections
Explanations of what each section does
Explanations about what has changed from the previous year
Auto-loads all information from the previous version
""Risk Monitor"" gives you peace of mind when you're done
5 Free federal uploads

H&R Cons:

Lower federal return amount than last year
Poor explanation of what can be deducted in the state section
Very little guidance through sub sections that deal with specific lists
In the final stages the software will ""loop"" continuously when it gets to the state return

Overall I'd say that H&R is easier and more user friendly. TurboTax is more thorough, but less user friendly, and has far more glitches. (I had to re-submit last year with TurboTax). The good news is that tax software is getting better every year. H&R is no exception, I will probably use it again next year."
"Great for online work. You will need to discover all it has to offer on your own, as there are no tutorials, but just click and read you will get it."
"I have this programs for years,the best I seen and used for all my home videos .I love it very much."
"Remote desktop should have been a part of the standard windows7 program, this is basically rendering the homepremium verison useless, unless you upgrade with the extra fee."
".Mac is essential program for everyone to have.  With all of the types of data that is backed up through the Backup application and the Sync portion of the program, there is not enough statements of gratitude that I can mention.  With the new added features, Steve Jobs and Apple have outdone themselves and Microsoft again!  Photocopy this program Microsoft!!"
This product is easy to use and worth the price. Always updating to keep you safe. Avoid problems by disabling other virus programs when using P C Matic.
"Good study method, fast shipping!"
Loads of amazing and gorgeous fonts in this package! A great deal!
So far no complaints. It has a nice new feature for pulling in current bills. It's generally the same as 2015 so it will be familiar but with a few new nice to have features. So far it has seemed stable and I have had no problems.
easy access
100 % Recommnded
Excellent application when you have problems you can restore your computer within 7 minutes. You can backup easily documents...
Love this program.
"a reliable system, better than current stuff in my opinion."
"AVOID this software company . I purchased this product , ran a scan  the scan said there were issues with my PC , than A message popped up telling me it could not fix my problem. so i called customer support. The support woman took remote access of my PC and asked me have you had problems with your pc , she said she found corrupt files etc... so she said she has to transfer me to the supervisor so this supervisor proceeds to explain  that i  have bad files on  my system that captures my bank info etc... so than she tells me we can help you a one time fix will only cost you 79.00 What i say i just paid 39.00 for this product  she ignores me and keeps talking about how i should fix my pc only 79.00 . I had to keep saying no . after i got off the phone with her, i saw that my avg protection was now expired hmmm. I retured the product to Best Buy and am now using Webroot  with no issues."
Just used in Italy and GB. I don't know why anyone has had any problems. Worked great and had very fine detail.
"I have been using ESET SMART SECURITY for several years. The price on Amazon is half of that at ESET. I have not had any viruses  on any of my computers. The only problem with the ESET SMART SECURITY since CNET put in a downloader in a lot of their programs,it sees it as a trojan and I have to go to another web site that does not use an installer to download it. The antivirus program from ESET does not have this problem."
"It is not an improvement over their rudimentary Mac version, which isn't good.  The new version seems to open up 2 copies of every account I click on.  When I download my transactions, it doesn't recognize that I already have that account in Quicken, so it tries to create a new account rather than integrate the data into the existing account. I can double click to save a transaction, but I can't seem to find a ""save"" button.  I'm baffled by the categories it creates for my transactions, which don't match the ones I've always used before. How do I schedule recurring transactions?  I don't know.  I don't even want to try to enter a transfer between accounts, because I'm sure it'll just duplicate the transaction.  Everything is difficult and ponderous.  It is so inferior to the PC version, that it is even worse than the PC version from a decade ago.  I really have nothing positive to say about Quicken for Mac 2015.  I was hoping for so much more."
"I cannot recommend this product.  While it is initially much cheaper than TurboTax, they charge $40 for any additional state return programs and $20 per state to file.  After the add-ons, suddenly the price advantage becomes more questionable.

I found a bug in their Indiana state module that causes the amount of return to be incorrectly high.  What's worse, it's actually not possible to correct it without going into the tax forms during the accuracy review and overriding the incorrect entry.  So, even if I wanted to pay $20 to e-file this state, I can't anymore.  I called their support line and alerted them of the bug, gave them a reproduction and explained to them how to fix it.  I told them that I wanted my money back under their ""Maximum Return Guarantee"" and they said they had to escalate to a manager to dispense it.  I'm looking forward to seeing whether their ""guarantee"" is for real or just a bunch of hot air.

Update:  Good luck getting your money back on that ""guarantee"".  Caught their bug, gave them instructions to reproduce it, called their support and got them to verify it, and even told them how to fix it.  One star for false advertising.  Never again, H&R Block."
"To start off my review, this was a very good Christmas gift i received. I was reading another users rating and said it was painful to install, In the beginning it was but I shoot a email to their tech support and thy helped me resolved it in 3 emails after some verification. I have been with kaspersky since the 2013 versions and their products have safeguarded me from the most horrific malware there is. This was on sale at the time, was a very good gift for my soon to expire kaspersky suite. Very good on the resources, so you can use the computer while it scan but I always save my work and let it scan while I am away so that it can get the maximum usage. To conclude, this is a very good product and whenever I have a issue, i can either chat of email them and their tech are on 24/7 standby to assist in any way. Very trusted brand for Internet Security."
"I think this is going to be a good product.  Bought it because my other laptop with Office 2013 crashed.  Still getting used to it, but so far so good."
"not what it look's like,all that glitters is not gold. If not thru Amazon be careful what you buy."
"Works quietly and easily, and does not drain system resources.  I haven't an infection on my PC since installing and that's what I was hoping for.

Some of the other reviews complain about the rebate and subscription process.  Canceling is easy, and plenty of services operate this way.  It  isn't difficult if you're even slightly organized."
"Easy, fast upgrade. The best yet. I would recommend this to others based on the new features, ie. mobile connection, snap and store receipts. Makes record keeping so much more convenient."
This was great
My question is.  If I have bought the version in which you download from a disc.  Can I now use the downloaded version?  Will they talk to each other
"I completed my taxes with this software easily enough, but kept running into errors with eFiling. I was told to wait 3 weeks for a software update that would fix the problem, but all the update did was tell me that I was required to either work with their ""Best of Both"" program for another $100 or in-office for another $350, just because I have self-employment insurance deductions. This software is advertised as a solution for self-employed individuals, but clearly is not."
"This is a so-so product.  The ancestry product is really 50% the software tools and 50% the online ancestry.com access that membership provides.  Without online access, you are just twiddling your thumbs.

The product does what you intend.  It is pretty easy to create a family tree and do research.  However, it does have its quirks.

For example, the program is great if you don't make any errors.  However, what do you do if you accidently ""skip"" a generation or go off in the wrong direction for a couple generations.  How do you fix that?  Good question.  I sure as heck never figured it out.  That's not to say that there isn't a solution - it just isn't readily apparent.  I resorted to making several smaller trees versus on large tree given the risk of making an error.

Also, the online search resources really aren't that good.  Yes, you can eventually find what you are looking for, but it takes awhile.  A typical internet search engine does a better job.  I've run searches for people I know exist, but I can't find them - it is not that they aren't in the database... it's that the database won't always produce a result unless you search a certain way.  The details aren't important... If you work enough with the online resource you will see what I mean.

I thought maybe my family was descended from silverback gorillas, but I couldn't validate that.  You see, my dad has a fairly hairy back and I figured it probably came from a gorilla ancestor.  Oh well... maybe it was a chimp...

The downfall of the ancestry products is the amount of garbage genealogy available online.  Ancestry.com has become the Facebook of family trees.  Anyone can post any tree they want in the public trees section and there is no verification.  I'm not suggesting there could be or should be, but the public trees are full or garbage.  I guess you just have to accept this going in and double-check everything.

Word to the wise - don't be surprised if you contact distant relatives and they freak out.  I did this several times after tracking them down using Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.  The typically reaction was ""how did you find me"", or no reaction at all.  I think people's default is to think you are an identity thief trying to get information out of them.  In general, they are shocked that someone was able to track them down or find their email address.  Dude - you have a Facebook page!  Dude - you have a LinkedIn page that lists the last 20 years of your life!  Dude - you work for a company that lists your name and contact information on their website!  People shouldn't be surprised that you can find them online... they should be disturbed how much of their personal information they choose to post online.

You can track down just about anyone under the age of 30 in about 15 minutes.  Things get harder after that.  Up to 40 is still possible.  After that is a crap-shoot."
"Wish I could give 0 stars.

I cannot upload music in MP3 format. The uploader sees and scans the library but does not actually upload the songs. And the few files it does upload it messes up the tags.
In addition I cannot upload all of my loss-less FLAC music. Amazon Musict randomly decides what songs inside an album it will recognize. Usually about 10% of the actual songs.

I have tried the uploader on both Mac and PC platforms, both without success. I have updated Flash/Adobe Air. I've made sure the latest version is installed. All to no avail.

So I may get access to thousands of songs online but I am completely unable to take advantage of it.

Terrible customer experience, poorly thought out workflow, dreadful QA of features. Not at all what I expect from Amazon."
"I don't understand how it works. Seems to be limited to PDF files and they want to sell me a monthly fee for PDF conversion.
I am a software developer, I should be able to understand how I can edit a picture easily. I have no idea how to get started with this after doing their initial download, except that they want me to sign up a for PDF monthly fee for file conversions."
"We love this program!  To be able to enter our receipts on the fly with our smartphone or tablet keeps us so much more organized!  I would highly recommend this product, even if you are already using Quicken!  This is worth the cost of the upgrade!"
"The new version of Office 2008 is totally dysfunctional. Problems:
1. No data analysis tools in Excel.
2. Crashes every 5 minutes.
3. Documents scroll very slowly even when running on a new iMac. Editing graphs is so slow it's like running office on a 10-year old computer.
4. Graphing functions in Excel are incredibly hard to find graphing functions like adding labels to axes.
5. Default view and graph styles in Excel are different than previous versions.
6. XML graphics generation is buggy and produces artifacts.

All I have to say to Microsoft is thanks a lot. Thanks for the most dysfunctional pos you have ever put out. There is good news however. OpenOffice can be downloaded for free and it's very user friendly and reads and writes all office document formats."
Installed Windows 10 on a new hard drive.  The install from the USB drive worked well.
"I have a client who uses a product which needs to integrate into outlook. Outlook 2010 did not preserve the prior integration interface and isn't backward compatible with this product. ARGH! So we have to use outlook 2007. Unfortunately it looks unlikely a new version of the product is going to happen any time soon, even this long after outlook 2010 came out.

So much for maintaining some backward compatibility for add-in's across versions. In this instance Outlook 2007 has been a ""hero"" for this client, but Office 2010 has been a ""Zero""."
I have a older version Legal software of different brand and it has more contracts than this one. I got this to try and update the technology.due to updated Windows.
"Very effective and unobtrusive software. Has done an excellent job of protecting my computers; and has frequent updates, so I know we have the latest in virus protection. Definitely recommend it."
"I had Norton 360 which I bought for all my computers, and it took about 15 minutes on average for 360 to have my computers ready to go.

With this new product all the computers are ready to go in about 30 seconds. Same greatNorton protection on my HP PC's, just way faster, so thanks for listening.

(*** NOTE: When I had my IMAC computer I never had Internet Security. I did not even know what it was and because it was a Mac I never got a virus. Maybe I was just lucky.)"
easy to use on my computer and phone.  support info really helpful.  what's not to like?  works as promised.  all good.  thank you
This is a fun game but we got I spy Treasure Hunt first and it was so much better. It was a little bit of a let down. Over all a great game for the whole family.
Never used it....Looking for one that reads to you
"I've been using this software to pump out DVD after DVD for the past 2 years, and I have never been disappointed with this product. I created a DVD of my son's Little League tournament, and I had like a week to put it together and it was my very first project. I got it done because this product is very intuitive to use. First rate for something under $100."
"I don't agree with the biased CPA below (can't buy judgement in a box). I've used TT for years and am an accountant. For MANY people it's fine. Sure, if you are rich and have complex tax issues, you may need advice. And if you are self-employed you may need help coming up with more deductions which will save you more than you pay for the help, that's fine. But for most people, with basic tax returns, tax software is fine.

BUT BEWARE OF THIS YEAR'S TURBO TAX!

Don't do it! Most likely it won't install correctly. Many people this year, including me, simply cannot run Turbo Tax. I spent hours on tech support TWICE, tried the ""fixes"" on the message boards at their web site, and still nothing. It simply will NOT run.

Intuit used to be a good company with good products and good customer service and tech support. But that was 10 years ago. Now? Lousy everything. I know more about their products than their tech support people. They seem to have been pulled off the street and given one hour of training.

I may try Tax Cut but I'm bummed about the review below that says TT is better than Tax Cut. If that's true, TC must REALLY be lousy! But what else can I do? TT won't work on my computer."
Excellent product. LOVE IT.
"QuickBooks Accountant 2011 has all the bases covered.  Great bookkeeping is just for openers.  There is also great report writing capabilities, depreciation, import, export, PDF creation, data review, and many others.  I am always learning new things about the software, but at the same time, it is intuitive and easy to learn."
I just enter the answer of the question and it is done. I efile federal and state tax without any issue.
"Gift for grandchild - seemed to appreciate it , and use it. (good price)."
Good for getting your feet wet before purchasing a more pricey program for a specific language.
For the reason I purchased the product is sufficient.  I do find it a bit hard to work with but for the price can't complain

2:03 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Shall I proceed now?
2:03 PM Penelope Carpenter: Sure
2:04 PM Penelope Carpenter: Sorry. Just charging my phone.
2:05 PM SACHIN GUPTA: No problem.
2:06 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Can I see that order from Amazon?
2:07 PM Penelope Carpenter: There you go.
2:10 PM SACHIN GUPTA: You received an invalid key error because your product key can only be used to activate a product in the geographic region it was intended for.
2:11 PM Penelope Carpenter: How am I to know that? Just what is that region?
2:11 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Actually each Norton product is prepared to be used in a specific region and you got a product which should be used in some other region.
2:12 PM Penelope Carpenter: brb
2:12 PM SACHIN GUPTA: I request you to contact Amazon customer care.
2:12 PM SACHIN GUPTA: And they will definitely help you in this.
2:12 PM Penelope Carpenter: I need you to intermediate.
2:12 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Please wait.
2:15 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Penelope, I apologize for that as it is a third party issue and Amazon can help you in this regard only.
2:16 PM Penelope Carpenter: Who is your channel marketing director????
2:17 PM SACHIN GUPTA: I can understand what you are feeling this time but we are helpless. I hope you can understand this.
2:17 PM SACHIN GUPTA: I request you to purchase Norton product from our website only in future.
2:17 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Amazon people will definitely help you in this. Please try to reach them once.
2:19 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Can you do that?
2:21 PM Penelope Carpenter: Norton charges almost 3X the money and obviously does not provide customer support, so it would move me to change products in the future. Very disappointed in the policy.
2:22 PM SACHIN GUPTA: I apologize for the inconvenience caused to you. If you want I can provide you an offer.
2:24 PM Penelope Carpenter: In going over the reviews on Amazon, I am not the first person this has happened to. I had hoped Symantec had resolved the hole in it's customer service regarding this issue by contacting your customer service directly. I received the prodcut via mail order and have no way of knowing if the product was meant for California or China. It seems to be a sales department problem with their 3rd party vendor. Therefore I am requesting Symantec resolve it for me quickly.
2:24 PM SACHIN GUPTA: We cannot do anything in this regard but if you purchase Norton from our website this time, we will provide you 6 months free subscription in it so that it can compensate your charge to some extent. Is it fine with you?
2:25 PM Penelope Carpenter: To put it simply, the 3rd party vendor would not have it to sell if Symantec had not sold it to them in the first place.
2:25 PM Penelope Carpenter: No. That is not a resolution that will work for me.
2:25 PM Penelope Carpenter: I have already spent the money on the first copy.
2:26 PM Penelope Carpenter: I do not have $90 today to do so.
2:27 PM Penelope Carpenter: I simply want Symantec to provide a working product key for my purchase.
2:28 PM Penelope Carpenter: My purchase was made in good faith from a large vendor supplied by Symantec. I do not understand why this is an issue.
2:29 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Please do not worry.
2:30 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Please allow me a minute.
2:30 PM SACHIN GUPTA: I am working on my tools.
2:31 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Thank you.
2:31 PM Penelope Carpenter: Thank you. I am waiting.
2:31 PM SACHIN GUPTA: You are welcome.
2:31 PM SACHIN GUPTA: As you have purchased the Norton product from Amazon, so, I would request you to contact them.
2:32 PM SACHIN GUPTA: I am 100% sure that they will replace the product key.
2:32 PM Penelope Carpenter: I do not want to have to go through a 3rd party return process. It is one of Amazon's vendors that did this.
2:33 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Amazon is not our vendor.
2:34 PM Penelope Carpenter: Then how can they supply our product? Software Quick is the actual vendor listed. I let you look at my order. Did you see that?
2:34 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Yes, I do.
2:35 PM Penelope Carpenter: I worked for Software Re-Sellers before and they would have had to purchase the product from Syamantec at some point for it to be a legal licensed copy.
2:35 PM Penelope Carpenter: So your claim that it is not your vendor does not seem logical.
2:35 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Please contact Amazon for the change of the product key. I am sure that they will exchange the product key. Please ask them to change the product key and they will surely do it.
2:36 PM Penelope Carpenter: I would like to speak to a supervisor at Symantec.
2:38 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Sure. I would strictly recommend you to buy Norton 360 directly from us. If you would have purchased Norton product from us, we have provided the another product key of this Norton product.
2:39 PM Penelope Carpenter: I've always bought it online, from Costco, and Amazon (all 3rd party providers!) and have never had this issue. Do not scold me.
2:39 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Now, in this case, I would request you to contact Amazon so that they can provide you a another product key. If in case, if they do not provide the product key, please contact us back with the same case id.

2:03 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Shall I proceed now?
2:03 PM Penelope Carpenter: Sure
2:04 PM Penelope Carpenter: Sorry. Just charging my phone.
2:05 PM SACHIN GUPTA: No problem.
2:06 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Can I see that order from Amazon?
2:07 PM Penelope Carpenter: There you go.
2:10 PM SACHIN GUPTA: You received an invalid key error because your product key can only be used to activate a product in the geographic region it was intended for.
2:11 PM Penelope Carpenter: How am I to know that? Just what is that region?
2:11 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Actually each Norton product is prepared to be used in a specific region and you got a product which should be used in some other region.
2:12 PM Penelope Carpenter: brb
2:12 PM SACHIN GUPTA: I request you to contact Amazon customer care.
2:12 PM SACHIN GUPTA: And they will definitely help you in this.
2:12 PM Penelope Carpenter: I need you to intermediate.
2:12 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Please wait.
2:15 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Penelope, I apologize for that as it is a third party issue and Amazon can help you in this regard only.
2:16 PM Penelope Carpenter: Who is your channel marketing director????
2:17 PM SACHIN GUPTA: I can understand what you are feeling this time but we are helpless. I hope you can understand this.
2:17 PM SACHIN GUPTA: I request you to purchase Norton product from our website only in future.
2:17 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Amazon people will definitely help you in this. Please try to reach them once.
2:19 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Can you do that?
2:21 PM Penelope Carpenter: Norton charges almost 3X the money and obviously does not provide customer support, so it would move me to change products in the future. Very disappointed in the policy.
2:22 PM SACHIN GUPTA: I apologize for the inconvenience caused to you. If you want I can provide you an offer.
2:24 PM Penelope Carpenter: In going over the reviews on Amazon, I am not the first person this has happened to. I had hoped Symantec had resolved the hole in it's customer service regarding this issue by contacting your customer service directly. I received the prodcut via mail order and have no way of knowing if the product was meant for California or China. It seems to be a sales department problem with their 3rd party vendor. Therefore I am requesting Symantec resolve it for me quickly.
2:24 PM SACHIN GUPTA: We cannot do anything in this regard but if you purchase Norton from our website this time, we will provide you 6 months free subscription in it so that it can compensate your charge to some extent. Is it fine with you?
2:25 PM Penelope Carpenter: To put it simply, the 3rd party vendor would not have it to sell if Symantec had not sold it to them in the first place.
2:25 PM Penelope Carpenter: No. That is not a resolution that will work for me.
2:25 PM Penelope Carpenter: I have already spent the money on the first copy.
2:26 PM Penelope Carpenter: I do not have $90 today to do so.
2:27 PM Penelope Carpenter: I simply want Symantec to provide a working product key for my purchase.
2:28 PM Penelope Carpenter: My purchase was made in good faith from a large vendor supplied by Symantec. I do not understand why this is an issue.
2:29 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Please do not worry.
2:30 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Please allow me a minute.
2:30 PM SACHIN GUPTA: I am working on my tools.
2:31 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Thank you.
2:31 PM Penelope Carpenter: Thank you. I am waiting.
2:31 PM SACHIN GUPTA: You are welcome.
2:31 PM SACHIN GUPTA: As you have purchased the Norton product from Amazon, so, I would request you to contact them.
2:32 PM SACHIN GUPTA: I am 100% sure that they will replace the product key.
2:32 PM Penelope Carpenter: I do not want to have to go through a 3rd party return process. It is one of Amazon's vendors that did this.
2:33 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Amazon is not our vendor.
2:34 PM Penelope Carpenter: Then how can they supply our product? Software Quick is the actual vendor listed. I let you look at my order. Did you see that?
2:34 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Yes, I do.
2:35 PM Penelope Carpenter: I worked for Software Re-Sellers before and they would have had to purchase the product from Syamantec at some point for it to be a legal licensed copy.
2:35 PM Penelope Carpenter: So your claim that it is not your vendor does not seem logical.
2:35 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Please contact Amazon for the change of the product key. I am sure that they will exchange the product key. Please ask them to change the product key and they will surely do it.
2:36 PM Penelope Carpenter: I would like to speak to a supervisor at Symantec.
2:38 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Sure. I would strictly recommend you to buy Norton 360 directly from us. If you would have purchased Norton product from us, we have provided the another product key of this Norton product.
2:39 PM Penelope Carpenter: I've always bought it online, from Costco, and Amazon (all 3rd party providers!) and have never had this issue. Do not scold me.
2:39 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Now, in this case, I would request you to contact Amazon so that they can provide you a another product key. If in case, if they do not provide the product key, please contact us back with the same case id.
2:39 PM Penelope Carpenter: I am requesting your supervisor for the 2nd time. Please have them contact me.
2:40 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Sure.
2:40 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Please stay connected.
2:41 PM Penelope Carpenter: And I will post the whole conversation on Amazon reviews so others can be forewarned.

"The tile of the program is ""Office X6"". Who would guess that it is only for home use, not in an office. You find that out after you buy the program and read the EULA. Plus, the wordperfect conversion of word docs ruins the word formatting and it is very difficult and time-consuming to correct the errors. When I called for customer service, guess what they told me...I shouldn't have bought this product for office use - it's a home use product only. no apologies for the mis-formatting and for the lack of proper advertising. I really think this is a program from hell. It simply has taken over my computer, and I cannot get the customer service to fix it. Don't buy it!"
"nice softweaere it works in my  vista or seven and it is easily  installed
as the work is more than"
"Full functioned and free, who could complain"
"I was able to use this products, and it was satisfactory to what I needed to get done,  I will definatley purchaed this again"
"The program kept resetting itself to its defaults after I set up custom scans, etc. It also slowed down my system, I would have to shut it down and restart it to rectify the problem. I grew tired of constantly having to tinker with it and uninstalled it and went back to ESET. I did a lot of research on Webroot before I bought it, so I know my results aren't typical, but I am very unimpressed with it."
"Love having all my recipes in one place--I can even download recipes from the net! Great video of instructions, too! And it's free with purchase of my Aroma rice cooker/steamer/slow cooker."
"Awful.  It has made my internet browser completely unusable.  There are almost no instructions, which would be fine if it just worked."
"I love turbo tax
 I have used it for many years. Turbo Tax has made it easy to do my taxes. It walks me through every item so I don't miss anything. I also love It's  Deductable. It helps me with my charitable donations"
"This is a great product for keeping track of ones investments (no matter how complicated) and ones various bank and money market accounts, and I have used Quicken for these for many years. I do not use most of the other features, as I have not found them very helpful. For what I do use, the upgrade from Q2011 to Q2014 has not added much, but I found out that the upgrade was necessary, as Intuit was about to cut off my bank account update capabilities unless I purchased the newer edition. There is the ability to use this edition with mobile devices, but that doesn't interest me very much (I don't even carry my smart phone with me except when traveling; once I get where I am going, I'm back to using my laptop)."
Way too expensive. Will be looking at other packages next year.
I started out by installing Ubuntu as I was familiar with it. However in the middle of the install the power went out and I was left without an OS. It was easier for me to pay a few bucks than getting someone else to load it onto a disk for me. After a few weeks I am much happier with Mint than I was with Ubuntu. It fits the purpose of mainly a laptop used for surfing the web for my girlfriends art studio I set up for her. I was worried about installing Linux for her as she is about as tech savvy as a 90 year old farmer. But it is very user friendly and with all the apps needed preloaded she has taken to it very well.
What can I say. I have used Sony before and this is the best. I like to record my own music and this works very well. Thank you.
My granddaughter  love it
"I purchased this program because I needed it for people doing PP presentations while using my Mac.  Personally, I much prefer Mac's Keynote.  It gives you more templates, etc.  So it will not replace Keynote with PP, though before trying it out, I was open to doing so since PP seems to be synonymous with 'presentations.'"
The product is good but make sure to double check what you purchase....I thought I could upgrade all 3 of my computers but this was only a license for one upgrade.  I wish I could find a multiple license upgrade.
"I am really not sure about this product, I will have to buy in the near future for now I am checking my options."
This was a waste of money. I downloaded it on my laptop which has Windows 8 and my laptop said it wasn't compatible.  I had to delete it.
"I had been using PeachTree 2003 Complete which is a better program if you are an accountant.  I used it for several years and found it a challange, though I was getting by with it.

I received a trial offer from MS and installed it.  I had Office 2003.  Now my business contacts are common to SBA and Outlook.

My invoice forms are editable with MS Word and I can generate an html e-mail invoice from them.  I've even been able to include a PayPal pay now button in the e-mail invoice.

I can generate an Excel worksheet from a report with one click.

Overall, I like it better.  I run a 2ghz P4 with 756MB memory and the product is a little sluggish, but stable (SP3).  It uses the personal SQL server (MSDE) and has a backup utility producing a zipped file.

I installed the MS trial and then used the key from my purchased copy to remove the trial status."
Not as good as Mircosoft works or student but works well and so much easier to use .... I do not know about how compatible it is with other programs but works well for me.  I can not complain about the cost cause it is free .. I enjoy this very much
Hard to move around in the program. It does things unfimiliar to me and I found it hard to use
I've used Turbotax for years with great results.  This year it doesn't work.  The program won't launch.  I followed their instructions for a fix.  Three hours later; still doesn't work.  I want my money back.
"This movie-making software does not even offer scrolling titles or text, unless you upgrade it to Plus or Ultimate version.  What kind of so called video editor doesn't even offer that?

This video is bare bone basic video editing, I used to use Arcsoft Showbiz from 2002 and it has better features than this piece of junk.  I only upgraded to Studio because the product was compatible with windows Vista, however, Microsoft's movie maker software is even better - how pathetic.

Don't waste your money, now I have to spend another $80 to upgrade to the plus version of this software to get any usability out of it.  Then each feature you want to add to the editor is another $20-$100, by entering activation codes.  Pinnacle nickle and dimes you every step of the way.  This is the last time I will purchase a Pinnacle product."
I just started this game and got side tracked on a few other projects and haven't had the time to get back to it.  The other Nancy Drew games I have played have all been great games so I'm sure I will not be disappointed once I get back to this one.
Works well.
Good !
"Nero 9 installed in roughly 2 hours onto my quad-core, 64 bit, Windows 7 system. No problems other than the length of time it took. Then, on the website I saw that an updated version was available, I downloaded it, began the install and proceeded to get install errors. I canceled out and did an uninstall. The system was left a mess. Looking around I found that Nero had a cleanup too to remove all traces from a bad install. Gee, I wonder why they have that tool?

Eventually, after a few more failed attempts,and way too much time spent, I realized that I could use the Nero 9 Update by itself with the product key that came with my disk.

That install was reasonably quick and I now have a good working version of Nero 9.

So, getting back to the title of this epistle: Do they test these thing?"
"I use Adobe Photoshop to touch up photos. But Portrait Pro 15 is a very good program to fix head shots of people.
One thing I have learned is that you can go too far in fixing photos in this program and they soon look like a model.
Otherwise, It's an ideal program and easy to use."
It is more than just basic antivirus protection and  it's fairly easy to install and get all setup.
Ordered this awhile ago for my wife and she was able to use this Microsoft Office and Student 2007 for the purpose she needed at that time. No issues.
"I am new to graphics software all together. This seems easy to use so far. I didn't even use the easy interface, I used the default.
I'm happy with how they have videos right in there help menu to watch to be able to get right to working on your work. Thank you, I'm glad I made this purchase.
To answer anyone's questions on, Is this as good as the regular version?
I read a bunch on it and yes it is, the home and student is not but this version is Its for students in this line of education. They want them to come back and but the regular edition when they graduate so they left everything in. I found this to be true when I opened it up and then compared it to the regular one. This is your best buy, get this version.
If I find the link to the best website I found proving this I will add it"
My little animal loving kid thinks it is pretty cool.
Tried downloading this twice and both times I got an email saying I could download it but it wouldn't let me. I hope I don't get charged for this later
This was very helpful.  I highly recommend it to anyone preparing for part I.  It gives great feedback also!
I am having a terrible time with it and it is too confusing. The directions are not helpful and now I can not get my money back.
"Since I'm not particularly handy around the house, I had high hopes for this CD-ROM to help me as I maintain my older house. Unfortunately, this CD-ROM just scratches the surface of home repair, leaving out many scenarios I've encountered that I don't consider particularly exotic.
My wife, who *is* particularly handy around the house, browsed this CD-ROM as well, and told me that some of the instructions given were more complicated than necessary."
This did it's job. I took a trip to the UK and brought my GPS unit with me. Popped in the card at Manchester airport and away I went.
Great product! I've used it in the past so I just had slight rust. Smooth transition to the improvements
Unless you have a degree as a CPA don't bother buying this! I even took a course on Lynda.com regarding this version and it is still a nightmare! And as for the free one year to QuickBooks Online when I went to sign in it would not accept my product code and when I called Intuit their customer service reps WERE USELESS and when I spoke to a tech guy with QuickBooks online he told me I had to call Amazon for the proper code! So I called Amazon and they had no idea what I was talking about! Save yourself the angina attack and stick with however you were doing your books before because this software isn't worth your time!!
"I've been an all time Windows user, working with all Windows flavors from Windows 3.1 (oh, those days!) to the new resource-hungry Vista. My only previous experience with Linux was around year 2000 with RedHat, and back then I wasn't impressed. But Linux have changed a lot (evolved, really) since then.

Last month a friend of mine showed me Ubuntu, and I was intrigued enough to try it out on my home PC. I'm glad I did. Installation was smooth, fast, and even easier than installing Windows.

(BTW, the installer does not touch your Windows installation. It's smart enough to make room for the new OS in the HD and after installing and rebooting, you have the choice of booting up with Ubuntu or with Windows. It's called a dual-boot configuration. However a backup of your important files is in order, of course.)

And the Ubuntu OS is awesome! It can do everything Windows can in a fun, easy, powerful way. Ubuntu opened my eyes to the new Linux world, and it's a bright, fantastic world. For starters, it's great to be free of Antivirus / Antyspyware software slowing down my system. You can immediately start to browse the net, configure your e-mail client, add / remove software and install OS updates automatically (the Synaptic package manager is amazing, much better than Windows ""Add/Remove Program"" applet.) You have Office, CD/DVD Burner, Multimedia players, and instant access to thousand of software titles you can use for free. All of them can be installed/uninstalled in a second.

So now I find myself using MS Windows less and less. Ubuntu GUI (it's called GNOME) is  so easy to use I might stop caring about Windows completely in the future. Admittedly, I am a computer savvy person, so for the average user I recommend reading the Ubuntu Guide and/or ordering the Ubuntu book here on Amazon. The Ubuntu guide it's oriented towards new users, clearly written, and it shows you how to do all sort of things in Ubuntu.

So... do you want to spend $10 on the Ubuntu DVD and get a speedy, powerful and fun OS, or $150 to $350 on Vista, a monster that will eat up your valuable PC resources for breakfast? The choice is clear."
I saw this advertised on Amazon and decided to buy it since Lucky Larry's Lobstermania is one of my favorite slot games.  I like the fact that I don't have to use a disc to play the games like some of the other slot games.  It is a fun game.
"Its a windows no more to say, but I like the usb form and package."
I bought this software to install on our public Teen computers . . . I started playing with it after it installed (very easily) and it is really cool!  We did several teen summer reading programs centered around photography & digital editing at our library and the kids LOVED it . . . and they LOVE this software.  We may have to buy more for the adult computers!
"I would give it 0 stars if I could. Keep in mind that this software is FREE and that as a Prime customer I get to upload 250 songs for free.
We have an Alexa at home, and we thought it would be great to be able to play some of our songs from a playlist.

This piece of **** software made it such a frustrating experience to simply upload 12 songs and create a playlist, that I ended up uninstalling the software and simply stick with Pandora instead. Please Amazon get your act together, this software is diminishing the value of your service, not increasing it.

On startup this app will occasionally just display an error window  ""no disc is inserted"" that will not go away.
You will have to go into the task manager to end the end the task.
(control + shift +escape - remember that keyboard combination if you still intend to use this app from hell after this review).

The interface is confusing and work intensive for actions that should be simple.
I ended up with 7 versions of Blue Oyster Cult that I could not remove, because the software thinks it is smart.
When you upload a song already on the server it decides to use that one instead to limit the amount of songs that need to be uploaded.
Smart, if it actually works, the app proceeded to have some kind of ""conflict"" and ends up with duplicates of the song that you cannot delete out of the display list.

Somehow the app was unable to find a song by name. After looking for the album instead I still could not sort the window on song names, the option is simply not there. Creating a playlist of songs makes the app upload ALL the songs in the album even if only one song is selected. I am starting to wonder if this is by design.

Thank god I did not put down the $25 to upload up to 250.000 songs, it would have cost me my sanity to wrestle this software into doing what it is supposed to do."
"What a big lie!

Received Intuit GM Sasan Goodarzi's email below trying to explain away the reasons for their significant change in what's included in their product. At least be honest Sasan and state the obvious that greater profitability was at least partially in mind! Claiming they are removing standard schedules historically included with purchase to ""make it easier for me to choose the right product"" is outrageous. We're not stupid! My guess is you figured anyone itemizing (schedule C) would be able to pay more and anyone with stock sales (schedule D) or rentals (schedule E) even more still. If you had at least come forward and stated part of your decision was around profits I would have respected you more.

I have been purchasing Turbotax for 20 years every year. Plus I've used Quicken for longer than that. Now they want to double what I have to spend every year plus have gone about it in a very sneaky way. The email says nothing about going forward in 2015 so I assume we'll be back to this same game again. So what if I go through hoops and get my $25 rebate this year when I may be in the same boat next tax season.  Not for me...I'm switching to H&R Block's product unless a more permanent option is proposed.

Too late too little Sasan!

EMAIL FROM SASAN GOODARZI, GM Intuit:

We messed up. We made a change this year to TurboTax desktop software and we didn't do enough to communicate this change to you as proactively and broadly as we could or should have. I am very sorry for the anger and frustration we may have caused you.

Intuit has a long history of doing right by our customers, and in this instance, we did not live up to the standards of excellence you have come to expect from us. We did not handle this change in a manner that respected our loyal customers and we owe you an explanation of what we are doing to make it right. The change we made to our desktop products, both the download and CD versions, includes removing Schedules C, D, E and F from TurboTax Deluxe, which some long-time customers had relied on to report business income, investment sales and rental property income. As a result, you may now be required to upgrade the version of TurboTax you use even though your tax situation hasn't changed from last year.

Here's why we made the change. Over the years, we have worked hard to make it easy for you to choose the TurboTax product that is right for you and your unique tax situation. We want that choice to be clear and confidence inspiring. However, as new online and mobile technologies emerged, our products, and the tax scope and features they included, began to differ, leading to customer confusion. These differences also impeded our ability to introduce new innovations across our entire product line.

So this year, we made the product experience consistent across all TurboTax offerings. This change enables us to innovate faster and make improvements that benefit all customers at the same time, regardless of whether they use our online or desktop software. You can be sure that we've preserved what's unique to our desktop product: the ability to e-file up to five returns, switch to forms mode and install the software on multiple computers. Find the TurboTax product that's right for you.

  But good intent must be matched with great execution, and that is where we let you down. We have heard from many of you that you were surprised when you discovered the change. No one likes this kind of a surprise, so we are taking immediate action to make things right and help you through this transition year.

  We are giving $25 back if you purchased TurboTax Deluxe desktop software (CD or download) and filed your 2013 tax return and have to upgrade to TurboTax Premier or Home & Business to file your 2014 return. This will help you move to the right desktop product, while reducing the immediate and unexpected financial impact. After completing and filing your return this year, request your $25 here.

  I deeply regret the anger and distress we have caused those of you affected by this change. Our customers are the heartbeat of every TurboTax employee. Our hope is that we can regain your trust and demonstrate that our commitment to you has never been stronger.

  Sincerely,

  Sasan Goodarzi and the TurboTax Team

"Had issues installing the program, called Microsoft and they were able to help me, great customer service"
"I can hardly believe broadband has not covered the US yet and so many still have to suffer with dialup. In the meantime, this is the way to go with laptop or notebooks. Get a power and phoneline surge protecter too. Mine blu-up and I had to replace it."
The music selection is awdul
"The installation of the C-Dilla copy protection program as part of TurboTax is highly unethical software engineering. Why would Intuit want to harm all of their customers rather than just the people illegally copying their software?

I have been a loyal customer of Intuit's for the last 9 years. I have bought Quicken every other year and Turbotax & Turbotax state every year for the last 9 years. Now my loyalty as a long-term PAYING customer is rewarded with a 1 megabyte memory sucker running constantly on my machine. Of course, if the program is terminated or removed then I can no longer run their product! I never agreed to [C-Dilla] when I purchased Turbotax, but I guess I should have read all of the fine print in the license agreement.

I understand Intuit's wish to cut down on coypright infringement, but my need to cut down on unnecessary system processes running on MY COMPUTER is what matters to me! I can't wait to finish my taxes so I can uninstall Turbotax and get rid of C-Dilla.... I don't have a problem with the activation feature alone. It is [C-Dilla] constantly running in the background that I object to!

I imagine that it will take years to build back their customer's trust even if they decide to remove this nonsense from next year's product!"
Great Reference book
"Good product, fair price."
I have already use this for good. Great product easy to use.
I have been a paralegal for 30 years and nothing beats WordPerfect for the preparation of legal documents.  You can even export and import documents to and from MSWord.
"I generally use TurboTax for federal and state and thought this was a good deal. Now I found out the state is not included and to add the state from Intuit costs as much as I usually pay for TurboTax Deluxe with State. So if you need both federal and state, don't buy this product."
"Kind of disappointing. I had to download several codec packs to be able to rip some of my movie files to DVD. When I tried to open one moderately large file (1.8GB), the program crashed when I tried to save it in another format. Same file opens slowly in other tools, but they are able to handle it, at least, without crashing. Haven't had a chance to do too much video editing, but I found the interface to be a bit sluggish compared to other tools I have used. I deliberately bought an older version, since I am using a Win7 machine for editing. It does have a lot of options for saving, but it seems like thy may not always work reliably, especially for large video files..."
It use to be better.
"Do not buy. Use Lucid Charts. I bought 2013 in October of 2015 and then upon insistence from Microsoft upgraded to Windows 10. It no longer works and no one would upgrade me. I called Microsoft 3 times and go the same run around. To talk to someone who can help me, I had to buy a support service or they would not help me. I am not throwing good money after bad money. The the other options is to spend another $300 on a new license. Its not worth $600 nor is it work having to pay again when they go to Windows 11.
Listen to my warning, Microsoft does not care about your business and when they upgrade your products will stop working and you have to buy them again. I was with Lucid Charts and when I left, they reached out to me to understand why I was unhappy. I said I was simply used to Visio from using if for years. Well, its time to learn a new product because I cannot afford Microsoft extortion."
"Much the same as my 2010 version. The only reason to get it is that quicken will stop supporting it with our banks
the end of this April and had no choice but to purchase it. 2013 works fine, but nothing special."
"Easy to use, Easy to learn!"
"Am very happy with Quicken 2014.  It's an excellent product that keeps
my book keeping efforts under control and eliminates much paper.
Its solves many problems and I would be lost without it."
It is as the title says it is.  Data rescue will only rescue data and not programs.  I have used other software in the past that will recover the entire disk but It did recover large portions of the data.  I also found that after it completed its work I needed to uninstall it as it was conflicting with my internet security and a few other programs causing the system to freeze.  Overall it served the majority  of its purpose.
Paperport has always been the versatile go-to software for working with PDFs and image files. It work is better with Windows 10 than the previous version.
I Am Happy
"This product is very good, 2012 or 2011. No issues at all. Only complaint  I have, is that you have to pay more money to E-file your State return."
I used to HATE doing my taxes!  Now with Turbo-Tax I almost look forward to doing them.  I clearly would purchase to Deluxe version or higher.  If you can get away with the Basic version- you probably could just file the 1040EZ and be done with it.  I would consider myself fairly attuned to tax info; Turbo Tax always finds something that I would have forgotten.  Top notch product.
"Microsoft is such a rip off, good product but a real rip off for customers need Outlook."
Would not run.  Worthless.
"Great price and great protection for your computers, tablets and phones."
Very easy to follow instruction and let you do a full system backup or recovery.
Good product but sometimes it's too restrictive.
never worked
I've tried it on 2 different computers and it doesn't work properly.  It types whatever it wants and very seldom types what I say.  I spend more time correcting what it typed than I do just typing it myself
"I have two name brand VHS/DVD recorder/players.
While trying to burn several home movies I rec'd the ""copy protect message"" and the units stopped.
I decided to do some homework - here is what I found

1- When filming, if you used a camera with macrovision, (the copy protect magnetic strip device that is recorded onto the tape as required by law due to bootleg movies and such), you may be limited to copying the contents one time only - or maybe not at all.

2- If your VHS tapes are really starting to age, you may also get the copy protect message even if macrovision was not used.

This review was very helpful, as I was going to buy the ""Roxio Easy VHS to DVD"". I have decided to try and contact Roxio get answers to all of my questions. IE - are you able to make chapters on the DVDs? Are you able to seperate the tracks when duplicating old cassettes and LPS?"
Bst reader ever. Love using it instead of lugging  books around.
"Before I write my review, I would like to note that I have had one semester of Mandarin Chinese, so I am familiar with some of the most basic words and phrases.  I am using Rosetta Stone in addition to my Chinese classes so that I will learn to speak better and be able to listen to Chinese on a regular basis outside of class.

I read the User's Guide before -- and while -- using Rosetta Stone.  The program is not 100% user-friendly, so I needed the User's Guide to find out how to get started in the program, how to put the program in test mode, how to view my test scores, etc.

It is very easy after you read the user's guide and play around with the program for a little while to figure everything out.  You can select ""preview"" to see and hear what you will be learning, ""guided exercise"" to be taken through the lesson automatically, or go through the numbered exercises one by one.

With most exercises, you hear a description and/or see a photograph, and you have to match up the description and/or photo with one of four answer choices.  Depending on the exercise you do, you will have to recognize characters, spoken words, or both.

There are three options for reading and writing text:  Pinyin, simplified, and traditional characters.  These are on the lower right of the screen.  I am using traditional characters in my classes, so I always select the traditional characters option.

There seems to be a lot of confusion among reviewers about the writing section.  On my CD, there are four different types of exercises you can do in writing:  Two exercises allow for pinyin only and the other two allow for pinyin, simplified, or traditional characters.

Traditional and simplified characters can be entered into a text box using the drag-and-drop method.  If you use pinyin in writing, you have to make rather awkward tone mark selections and get them over the right letter or your answer is wrong.  Although some people would claim pinyin is easier than characters, in Rosetta Stone it is infinitely easier to memorize characters due to the constant repetition of phrases than it is to remember where the tone marks go in pinyin.

The Curriculum Text so far is of no use to me at all, and appears to be in pinyin and simplified characters only (which is no good for someone trying to learn traditional characters).  You don't even really need it to proceed with the lessons, anyway.

The speaking portion is not working out entirely well for me, personally.  You need a USB headset to record your voice in order to compare it to the native speaker's.  I have to speak at an unnaturally-loud level to record anything at all, and I have to speak with constant force in my voice or the program stops recording me.  I never get my reply to match the intensity of the speaker's, even with the microphone directly in front of my mouth and me speaking very loudly into it (just below shouting level).  This could be my problem, though.  Although I don't ever match the speaker's voice, it is good for practice to be able to hear the comparisons between my pronunciation and the speaker's.

I haven't needed to use customer support for anything so I can't comment on that and installation was easy.

I would describe my first semester of Chinese as intensely challenging and probably the hardest class I have ever taken in my life.  Like I said in the beginning, I am using Rosetta Stone to help me build on what I have learned already, and it has been great so far in that respect."
Exellent
"I have use this Tax software for many years. Tryed Turbo Tax but didn't like it. H&R Block does everything I want it to do, plus if you have tax questions they are answered for free."
I ordered a book and got a card instead for ebook. Half the semester has gone by it would be really silly to keep the book now. takes atleast 2 weeks in shipment
Sort of a disappointment as it downloads and installs and when clicked on tells you must update and then gives you error messages unable to install I wish I could give it no stars
Does not work with windows 10
"It is a good software, met expection as a customer. However, it is almost obselete now due to new versions of it."
"Unable to retrieve data from any disc on windows 7 or any other device. They, the discs ,  are useless. The family history resource file

Some opening problems but seems ok now
"I purchased this product for my 9 yo son to learn to type. He absolutely loves it. My goal was for him to do 2-3 lessons per week. After the first lesson, his response was, ""Can I do another one?"" He actually asks me if he can learn more of his typing (several times in a day). I highly recommend this product for anyone wanting to learn to type."
Very easy to use and has improved my pc performance
"I have been researching antivirus software for some time. I don't get viruses or malware but my family members get them daily because they click on spam emails all the time.
AV comparatives site gives ESET and Kaspersky top scores. I downloaded both companies trial versions and installed them in separate VM's and also multiple home PC's to see which one I liked better. I used them for 25 days before deciding which to buy.
 They both performed excellent; but I liked the interface of ESET a little better, it seemed more polished and the performance was a tad better; you can't go wrong with either one.
When you buy the Smart Security 6 you don't  need to use the CD provided in the box; simply download the pro version of their software, use the activation key provided in the box and follow the instruction.
Someone commented that it took them 4 hours to download the software; it took me less then 5 minutes, this also includes updating the virus database.
The program is excellent. I also use it alongside of Malwarebytes Pro.
The most impressive thing is the performance; it will not slow down your PC, compared to competing software that commonly comes with your PC or your Internet Service Provider gives you for free. It's worth the extra money to get something that doesn't slow your down."
Works great and can't beat the price!!
"I have used Quicken for over ten years, this was just an update."
"I am at an intermediate Spanish level and purchased this program because of the lower price compared to Rosetta Stone.  I was very surprised that this is European Spanish based, but then again it is by a company called Eurotalk.  The vocabulary differences and accent difference from Latin American Spanish bothered me too much.  This is a decent program and will be more helpful to you if you are going to travel to Spain.  If you are traveling to Latin America I would shy away from this program.  I will be returning mine as I do not feel it meets my needs at this time."
"Let me start off by saying that this is by no means a bad software package. I gave it an overall 3 stars because it is middle-of-the-road. That middle-of-the-road is its primary flaw.

I'm an advanced user. I've used software like Photoshop for years to create digital paintings, texture maps as well as to perform intensive photo editing on assets for films and interactive software. Serif PhotoPlus X4 offers a host of photo editing tools while stripping away a lot of the non-photo editing options contained in the more expensive suites like Photoshop. The software knows its purpose and performs it well.

The only criticism I have for it is that it's a little too specific. Professional photographers and design studios are going to want the extra bells and whistles that the full blown, industry standard, software packages provide. They are not in the market for a $25-$50 software package that only satisfies their basic photo-editing needs. The amateur photographer can easily perform a google search and find several reputable free-ware software packages that offer the same tools found in here.

So who is this software for? The only demographic that I really see showing an interest would be the semi-professional starting up their own business with limited funding. However, depending on their success, they will probably be making the upgrade to more powerful and full-featured software packages within a year or so. As I mentioned, this isn't bad software, it just doesn't really have its place."
"After various trials with other software i'm going to buy this after using the demo for 5 days.

Have tried various consumer products, the worst of which was definitely Pinnacles rubbish but this has offered me as much as I can ask.  The principle thing it does is work.  I know this sounds odd but every other piece of consumer video editing software i have tried is buggy and crashes frequently, or won't read a format.  This didn't crash once in 5 days and created a 2 hour multi source format dvd (including H.264 from a panasonic Hd SD1) with no crashes no fuss, just worked.

For me $500 is alot to pay for software (as a consumer doing this for friends and family) but after the hours tearing my hair out with substandard software im buying this."
"Have used earlier versions of Paperport. Always liked the product...the easy ability to scan and email documents as PDF files and to store and locate documents for paperless operation.  Only question was whether Paperport 12 would run well on Windows 7 Professional. Some scary reviews out there questioning this. Well, it works fine. No problem at all running on Windows 7."
"Though the software does take you through the Plan writing process in steps, I prefer to have the entire document right in front of me as I'm writing, so I created mine in Word.  While I didn't care for the blank template offered in this software, the myriad of business and marketing plan examples were extremely helpful in getting me through my first attempt at composing a Plan of my own.  You have your own library of successful business plans to reference."
Can't work this one.
"The product was late coming in the mail, but overall was easy to install and has all the features I was looking for.
It will just take some time to figure out it all but I'm overall pleased with this product."
No success using it
"We bought this game for our 4 1/2 year old boy. He loves it! You can design your own monster trucks and race them down a track and do freestyle as well (jumps over cars and airplanes). You pick up bonus points as you race so you can get new decals for your trucks. It's simple to play since you use the arrow keys to move left, right front and backwards. The only thing is that we have xp and it freezes up when you create your own track - but since there are tracks already made for you, we just bypass the 'makeing your own track' option"
Just upgraded my program.  I love it.  Very easy to use and I can make all kinds of different projects with it.
"I'm very happy with Office 2016. I had tried Office 365, but my computers simply didn't recognize the download and I didn't have the time or patience to spend more time fighting with it. I was also unhappy with 365 because I really, really hate the idea of having to pay about $100 a year forever to update a program that I need to use daily. I don't care about the latest, greatest features. Just give me a good, stable program that I can quickly learn, and let me do my work!
Office 2016 is easy to access, with icons for Word, PowerPoint, OneNote and Excel on the home screen. It is also easy to learn and use."
We have had Corel WP for years.  We recently upgraded from 8 to 12 (we're a non profit) and 12 barely works with our network printer.  I've even spoken with COrel techs who've instructed me on how to set up documents to print to our printer-- it is so awkward a procedure (not to mention totally dumb).  What's worse is that it just doesn't work all the time.  THings are SO bad that I am constantly called to try to figure out why it won't print AGAIN.  We wish we'd thought to get the trial version first!  Many others have told me how horrible Corel's products are getting.  Nothing but trouble for us!!
"it is sooooo slowwww it's unbelievable! I don't have patience!  I regret getting it :( I even thought my laptop had gotten a virus, that's how slow it is."
Works well.  No problems.
"Money 2000 was great; it was fast, easy to use, and worked well.  2002 must have been written by a different group:  several features don't work like they're supposed to, the online banking 'feature' is horrible now -- it integrates unapproved transactions with your register, forcing you to search through your register to find unapproved transactions.  In addition, the budgeting feature breaks, and the really cool cash-flow feature doesn't work -- it will only display ""1999"" and a zero balance, and won't let you go in to specify different dates.
It's too bad it's such a pain (...)to return software, or I would have done it."

"Great floor-planner! Very intuitive to use. I used it to plan our addition. It has lots of 3D furniture to adjust to the exact footprint of my own furniture, which made it easy to try various arrangements to determine whether the doors and windows limited where we put our furniture. I've also used it to model existing spaces to test various furniture arrangements before having to lift, push, or pull anything, which was much less work than the old trial and error way with the actual furniture being moved about. If it had a roof line planning capability it would be perfect."
Just as easy as getting your paperwork ready for an accountant.
I bought the program and started using it not too long ago on my vista (It actually works thus far). I had already taken a japanese beginners course but hadn't gotten enough practice and forgot everything I learned. Although it was easier for me to pick it up it's pretty easy to pick up none the less. The only thing I have against this program is the visual appeal. It's not so great and some might feel it to be dull.... but than again one didn't buy this for looks. It's worth it.
"I bought this CD during 2010 and full unopened package got misplaced during my house shift. Recently i opened this CD and tried to install and use it.
The installation is succeeded. But while attempt to run this CD, the software throughs error mentioning ""please insert Genuine CD"".

Seems this CD sold here is not an original one. It is copied CD.  The protection in the Software doesn't allow to run the copied CD.

Now i don't know what to do with this junk piece. It is totally useless.
I never expected such product from amazon."
Great program. Ease of use and accuracy.
"I updated to Snow Leopard on a 2008 Macbook Pro 15"" 2.5 GHz Core 2 Duo.  Install was very smooth and it completed in about 50 mins.  The first thing I noticed was how quick Safari was in loading pages.  I've always been disappointed in the performance of Safari on Leopard and I'm happy to say it now works like it should with Snow Leopard.  Everything about the machine seems snappier.  Shut down, wake from sleep, sleep, boot up times all seem quicker than I'm used to.  I run vmware fusion 2.0.5 to have XP and Vista Ultimate and VM fusion is also noticeably quicker.  So far I'm really happy with Snow Leopard and the performance, it's brought some welcome improvements to my laptop."

"This is an excellent program for those who don`t want to spend $$$$ on expensive programs like Adobe Illustrator, in fact it has some features that Adobe doesn`t have. The only draw back is that the program is not compatable with the Mac`s at school and I had to purchase the other guys product anyway. Any buyers out there???"
I really like having this option but with so many free books in the regular kindle store I saw no need to keep using Unlimited
It was an old dated program that did not run well on current systems. I wasted my money. There needs to be a statement saying what systems program will run on. I'm very disappointed.
It is easy to use once you get used to it. I have been using TurboTax for many years. It covers more situations than I can consider and keeps updated according to the latest tax law.
Do not purschase this Avast software!  I made the mistake of purchasing the software for 2 of my computers.  I purchased the Avast premier version.  Spend over $100.0.  The program did not operate properly and adversely my outlook program.  I spend an addition $199.0 with AVAST CARE customer support.  I spend literally spend 2 and 1/2 days over 15 hours on live online support.  None of the technicans could solve the problem.  I got so disguised that I remove the software from both of my computers.  Take this as a warning DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!
Easier than Acronis. I'm switching all my PC to BUN 6.0
"Best deal, but was download___ I thought it was dvd"
Great software and very easy and fast to use. This is my 3rd year using TurboTax and I highly recommend it.
I have been doing our own taxes using Turbotax for at least 10 years and always have had the confidence that I was filing correctly. I especially like theE-file feature.  Our refund is always so fast and deposited in our account electronically.
A-OK.
Love these old cartoons. I like to share them with my grandkids.
Wonderful study material.
Their updates were 3 weeks behind hr block who I switched too. I used turbo 8 years and switched to hr.  Much cleaner

"My 100-user organization had Symantec Client Security 1.0 for two years. Had various problems including:
- infections with suspicious processes that caused obvious problems for users, yet Symantec reported no virus.
- twice, LiveUpdate imported new firewall policies that stopped a business-critical Access/SQL Server application from working until new firewall policies were deployed.
- the firewall recently started acting erratically and had to be uninstalled from many workstations.
- the products causes a very noticeable performance hit, really bad during scheduled scans.

Since there was no more support for our 1.0 version, I convinced the CFO to buy version 3.0. The server migration failed without explanation and wiped out our 1.0 server configuration. For one day I tried reinstalling eight times on two different servers, following various procedures and troubleshooting steps. The online technical forum is not well supported - it looks like 5% of questions placed in the last month got any answers. It took another day after I registered for support to finally get a phone number to call. Then two hours on the phone and multiple downloads of components and tools still yielded no clues why the installation failed.

Finally after a complete rebuild of the server, I discovered that changing a Group Policy setting (enable end users to select trusted publishers) fixed the problem. Now that it's installed, the product looks good. Remote client installation is very smooth, but given our history, I'll reserve final judgement for a few months."
"Below is mny review of the online download. I had to change the rating though because of the customer service I recieved from Matthew I did appreciate the fact that I was offered a physical dvd to use and recieved it in 2 days time. I am just starting the use of it and am not completely sure how much use I can get out of this product since I can only hear what the person is saying there are no pictures as indicated. Also I feel as though the speaker goes a little fast especially when the females come on and and the words are put into example sentences. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to try and follow along--well obviously I cant but that being said what is the point of this in the exercise if I can't follow along or understand all of the words being said since they are not all included in the vocab practice?
Another thing that I felt would have yielded a better result and would have made learning easier for me is a book that or visual that allows me to see the words that I am saying and trying to learn.
For these reasons I cannot give a 5 star review but I can say that I think through continual use of this product I will be able to easily recognize SOME of these words from the vocabulary exercises.

I have a windows 7 laptop and this software will not open on it I purchased the instant download of the software and it does not open. I've tried multple times on various occasions to no avail. My money and time has been wasted with this software and on top of that there is no option to get help so I must stay with a faulty product I'm beyond pissed and will never download anything from this company or amazon again."
"Hello friends..

If you are going to purchase Poser Pro as a digital download from Amazon, it's a great program, however, there's something that will save yourself a lot of trouble in the initial installation.

I didn't really see anything on any type of ""read me"" files that came with my download. If these instructions are there, then I clearly missed them.

However, I'd like to make it easy for people who are downloading this software, to save themselves the trouble I was able to eventually figure out.

I don't know if this is the same thing as when you download directly from Poser's ""Smith Micro's"" website, but if it does the same with those download packages, then hopefully through some word search, you've found this solution and it likewise works for you.

Before we begin, there's a quick 4 step process listed below all this much more detailed version of what to do and the explanation of this problem. If you're pretty computer savvy and not too interested in what's going on, just go to the bottom and read the 4 steps of instructions there.

For those more interested in the detail, here's what kept happening to me.

I purchased the downloadable version of Poser Pro 2012 from Amazon.com. I began my download, using the amazon poser pro downloader that takes a few mins to download, and that upon running, starts the actual download of Poser. Prepare to allow the better part of the whole day to download this program as Poser is quite sizable.

For me it automatically set up a folder for all the zipped / downloaded files to go to on my desktop.

**********HERE'S WHERE I WILL SAVE YOU A LOT OF TROUBLE**********

After a whole day or so of downloading, you now have that folder that automatically set up on your desktop sitting there.

Your first step is to UNZIP / EXPAND / EXTRACT, (however you want to say it) all the zipped folders. If I'm not mistaken, there should be 9 of them, and they are as follows:

PoserPro2012Animals
PoserPro2012CartoonFantasyFigures
PoserPro2012Clothing
PoserPro2012Hair
PoserPro2012Installer
PoserPro2012NudeFigures
PoserPro2012PropsScenery
PoserPro2012QueueManager2012Installer
PoserPro2012ReferenceFigures

So, right click each of these and Unzip or Extract them all. I would recommend for the sake of not making it confusing, to keep them in the same folder your zipped versions are in.

NOW, ONCE YOU'VE UNZIPPED / EXTRACTED ALL FOLDERS, IF YOU GO INTO THE ""PoserPro2012Installer"" FOLDER, AND CLICK THE ""Install Poser Pro 2012"" RED EXECUTABLE FILE, IT'S GOING TO INSTALL THE PROGRAM AND LEAVE BEHIND ALL THESE LIBRARIES THAT COME WITH YOUR SOFTWARE, LEAVING YOUR INSTALLATION INCOMPLETE AND YOU UNABLE TO USE THEM.

It will give you a few options such as folder directories etc, and after making your selections, begin installing the program.

Everything seems kosher, and a green progress bar shows the program as installing everything to the end. However, after reaching the end and waiting for about 15 seconds to half a minute or so, error messages start popping up, and read like the following:

""The installer executable for a selected content package was not found in this installer's source directory
C:\Users\ [your computer's name ] \Desktop\Poser Pro 2012\PoserPro2012Installer\Content\PoserHair.exe

note that for each content package, it displays one of these error boxes, every time you click ""Ok"" and the ""PoserHair.exe"" is just one of 8 of these. But actually, the ""Animals"" content package is the first one that pops up of the error messages, since it's alphabetically trying to run each executable in order.

After one of these incomplete installations, you'll still be able to run and use Poser, only it's going to be missing a vast amount of content and libraries that make the program what it's supposed to be.

It took me several attempts of uninstalling, reinstalling to figure out what was going on, but once I really stopped and read the message, it became very clear.

Take another look at one of the 8 error messages I was receiving at the end of the installation. Note the error messages I displayed above, and pay attention to the directory it couldn't find the other executable files in.

""The installer executable for a selected content package was not found in this installer's source directory
C:\Users\ [your computer's name ] \Desktop\Poser Pro 2012\PoserPro2012Installer\Content\PoserHair.exe

On the last line above that appears on these error messages, you see ...\...\Content\...

""Content"" is what I want you to notice and pay attention to.

If you, like myself, have already had this problem at the end of your installation, then you might notice upon reading the error windows that pop up at the end of your incomplete installation, that it's looking for, and EXPECTING these other executable files (such as the ""...Hair or ...Animals"" files) -for these libraries and content to be in this ""Content"" folder.

However, it's not finding any of these files and installing the rest of the additional program content and libraries, because this ""Content"" folder doesn't exist, and thus these other executable files have not yet been placed in it. Hence the 8 ""error messages"" at the end of your installation that leaves out so much of the content and libraries that came with your program.

The problem going on upon this incomplete installation, is that it wants to run these files, and install the additional content that comes with each of them, but the installer is looking for them to be in ""Content"" folder, and EXPECTING them to be in the proper directory above. (by ""directory"", I mean the sequential order of folders within folders)

SO, WE MUST MANUALLY CREATE THIS NEW FOLDER IN THE PROPER LOCATION, AND LIKEWISE MANUALLY PLACE EACH EXECUTABLE FILE INTO THIS FOLDER, SO THAT UPON INSTALLATION, THE INSTALLER CAN FIND IT AND LIKEWISE INSTALL ALL THIS ADDITIONAL CONTENT AND LIBRARIES.

SO HERE'S WHAT YOU DO...

AFTER YOU'VE UNZIPPED ALL FOLDERS (AND HOPEFULLY LEFT THEM IN THE DEFAULT FOLDER THAT WAS AUTOMATICALLY CREATED ON YOUR DESKTOP UPON YOUR DOWNLOAD) YOU NEED TO MANUALLY CREATE THE ""CONTENT"" FOLDER IN THE EXACT SAME DIRECTORY THAT'S APPEARING IN THESE ERROR MESSAGES,

To do this, double click and go into the now unzipped / extracted version of the folder, ""PoserPro2012Installer""

You should see that little red icon / executable file that says ""Install Poser Pro 2012"". DO NOT OPEN / DOUBLE CLICK OR ACTIVATE THIS FILE YET.

Instead, right click anywhere within the empty space around the folder and on the pop-up menu that comes up, scroll your mouse down to ""New"" and then click on ""Folder"" on the new sub-menu that also pops up.

Now, rename that new folder you just created ""Content"" and make sure you spell it correctly.

So now that you've created this new ""Content"" folder, INSIDE THE ""PoserPro2012Installer"" folder, YOU NOW NEED TO GO THROUGH EACH OF THE OTHER UNZIPPED / EXTRACTED VERSIONS OF THE FOLDERS LISTED ABOVE, AND BRING EACH EXECUTABLE FILE FOUND IN THOSE FOLDERS, AND PLACE THEM IN THE NEW ""Content"" folder you just created.

To do this, start with your first folder, ""PoserPro2012Animals"". Double click it, and once inside that folder, right click on the red ""PoserAnimals"" file. When you right click this file, select ""Cut"" about half way down the menu that pops up.

Back click out of that folder, (upper left arrows) until you see the folder holding the ""PoserPro2012Installer"" folder, along with all your other zipped/unzipped folders.

Open up / double click the same ""...Installer"" folder, and once inside, open up / double click the ""Content"" folder.

Right click in the blank area of that folder, and select ""Paste""

REPEAT THIS PROCESS FOR EACH AND EVERY EXECUTABLE FILE IN THEIR RESPECTIVE FOLDERS.

There should be 8 folders each with their own red executable file you have to do this for, AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOVE THE ""Install Poser Pro 2012"" executable to this ""Content"" folder. Just leave it in it's natural spot within the ""PoserPro2012Installer"" folder.

Make sure you've properly done this for each of these other 8 folders and their respective executable files. (Go in, and right-click ""Cut"" them out of their natural folders, and ""Paste"" them inside the ""Content"" folder)

If you've done all these steps correctly, then here's what you should have:

Inside the ""Poser Pro 2012"" Folder that was automatically set up, and most likely on your desktop (other locations are fine as well) you should have:

--Some files (3 or 4 or so) that hold keys, ""read me"" instructions etc. (these have been here with your download so don't worry you didn't miss nothing)

--Your zipped versions of the 9 folders listed above.

--Your unzipped / extracted  version of the same 9 folders.

Within the unzipped ""PoserPro2012Installer"" folder, you should have:

--A folder you created called ""Content""

--and below that a red executable file named ""Install Poser Pro 2012""

Within the ""Content"" folder, you should now have all the other (8) executable files you took from each of the other folders listed above.

They should be red icons and listed as follows:

Install Queue Manager 2012
PoserAnimals
PoserCartoons
PoserCasual
PoserClothing
PoserHair
PoserNudes
PoserProps

Note that the ""Install Poser Pro 2012"" executable file found resting naturally in it's own location one folder back, does not need to be moved here.

Now the installer will successfully find these other library and content packages it needs to give you all the bells and whistles of Poser Pro,

so activate / open / double click the ""Install Poser Pro 2012"" red icon resting inside the ""PoserPro2012Installer"" and if you've done everything correctly, you should be good to go, and a hopefully complete version of the installation that includes all the additional content and libraries should take place.

Hope this helps...

**********HERE'S THE SHORT VERSION**********

.. of how to make your installation a success without any of the problems I kept encountering

(1) After successful installation of all content from Amazon, Unzip / Extract / Expand all 9 folders (listed above)

(2) Go into the unzipped version of the ""PoserPro2012Installer"" folder, and create a new folder inside it. MAKE SURE YOU NAME IT ""Content"" without any misspelling, spaces, etc.

(3) Go back into each of the other unzipped / extracted folder, and ""Cut"" the red executable file from each, placing all 8 into the new ""Content"" folder resting inside the ""PoserPro2012Installer"" folder. (note, it's not ""9"" because the red executable inside ""...Installer"" folder, can and should be left alone)

(4) After doing this with each unzipped folder and the executable file inside, now go back to the ""PoserPro2012Installer"" folder, and click the ""Install Poser Pro 2012"" button."
Easy to use once I had someone show me all the ins and outs. Makes my business accounting extremely easy.
I am still learning how to use the new layout and features of QB Payroll 2015 but so far I like it.
Works great. Not intrucive.
"I like it, although I only bought it because my Nero 10 Platinum, the Nerovision part of it expired. It was a suprise to me. Must have been hidden in the license agreement. This one is probably the same way. I am going to try Corel Video Editor for future. I'm disappointed in Nero forcing me to upgrade just because I had the product for a long time. On the plus side, buying Nero Classic through Amazon what actually cheaper than ""upgrading""."
"I have been using HR Block tax software for MANY years now(back when it was called TaxCut) I find it very intuitive and easy to use. It contains information for may different tax scenarios, and asks questions that gets the needed information. I used to use Turbo Tax, but switched many years ago as I just found this to be easier to use."
the sate part is not include in this software for the same price I can buy one with the sate part. but the manufacture just sends  a link to make another purchase. very poor customer service
"I've been using this software for about 2 months, and I have to say it is really great.  I'm learning with a focus on reading, and I do feel pleased with the progress I've made, even with just 1 or 2 hours a day.  I feel comfortable with the grammar and vocabulary, which is what I have been emphasizing.  Also, the speaking and listening exercises are helpful, even though sometimes the dialogs are spoken a bit fast.  After all, we second language learners aspire to rise to the level of native speakers, so it's great practice.  Worth the money."
"I like this better than Corel Paintshop Pro X6, which I've used since version X4.  Good features and easy to use."
"I was ""forced"" to buy this version of Office for an office computer. Admittedly I'm running Office 2003 on my home machines (having transferred it from machine to machine over the past decade) but my dislike of the ribbon interface is shared by other people in the office who have been using more recent versions for a long time.

The interface on any application should be clean and easy to navigate; instead MS has given us a visually cluttered ribbon."
"great product and great seller, would use again"
But why in the world do we need Turbotax?  Why don't we simplify our tax code and make life easier for all Americans?
"First, I don't understand the many different choices for basically the same Norton (antivirus) products. I already have Norton installed and purchased this in advance so I chose the 5 device key card. Also, you can try (15 or 30 day trial version) direct from Norton and, if you are happy, you can then get a key card to extend your subscription for an additional 366 days. I say choose the lowest cost to meet your needs.

Second, since I have been using Norton for years, I thought it would be easier just to renew my subscription with a key code. Plus, this one was for 5 devices so I could also include my 2 Android devices. Unfortunately, I encountered a problem with my key code on my second computer where it stated the key code was not for my product. I called Norton where a very courteous representative worked with me over the phone as well as online to complete my renewal subscription. Originally, she told me I would have to download a different version but, in the end, I was able to enter my key code to renew. I had no problem with my third computer.

My first (Lenovo tablet) Android device immediately upgraded (from lite Norton mobile version) to the full version once I signed into my Norton account. My second (Tianle TV stick) Android device did not upgrade where I needed to uninstall Norton for mobile app and re-install it. Once I re-installed the Norton for Mobile devices and signed into my Norton account, it immediately upgraded to full version.

Anyway, overall, I'm sure Norton AntiVirus is (and has been) a good product for internet online security. But, since there are many other good (and free) antivirus choices, I can only rate this product as okay. Also, I didn't like having a problem with my subscription renewal process.

FYI: I recommend including Norton's (free) Identity Safe program for computers and mobile app for Android/Apple devices. This is one of the better password manager interfaces. With Norton Identity Safe, you have your passwords easily available on any computer or device you may be using. Plus, when you add or update any site password, it is available on any other computer or device you are using."
Our office uses Word Perfect and I needed to upgrade some lap tops that are used by associates at home.  The sources on Amazon were fantastic and the product is 100%.  The shipment arrived in a timely manner.  I will use Amazon again for such products.
"I learned to type in high school (on an electric typewriter, so I didn't get spoiled by spelling and grammar checkers), and I was already a pretty good typist on alpha keyboarding.  I am fair-to-middling on alphanumeric keyboarding and keypad data entry.  This software gives me a chance to practice and improve in all three areas.  The software does include levels for the brand-new and still-learning typist, although I can't speak to how well those work as I am already very experienced.  A few caveats:  While the alpha keyboarding and keypad data entry components are excellent, there is no component for true alphanumeric data entry (i.e. entering names, addresses, and phone numbers for database purposes).  The alphanumeric component is simply an integration of numbers and symbols into the alpha keyboarding paragraphs.  You need to be careful which scores you're looking at when deciding where you need to concentrate (or, say, you're putting together a resume and want to accentuate where your skills are); my alpha keyboarding is very fast and my alphanumeric keyboarding speed is mid-range, but my keypad data entry is pretty slow (I didn't cover that last in high school).  A combination score of all three of these is, I feel, unfair.  The games don't record the typing speed you achieve as you're playing, and you may not even see the typing speed if you are trying to concentrate on typing swiftly and accurately and can't look away long enough to see the current speed.  And, lastly, the ""Gone Fishing"" game sends the numbers darting too fast across the screen.  My 30+ year old eyes can barely catch them, let alone transmit the info to my fingers to key them."
quick to update and clear.  I Love it.
"Can't finish the game, it keeps freezing! Don't waste your money! If anyone knows how to fix the problem that would be great info to know."
"I do not like the Extremely INTRUSIVE  Microsoft Office 10 Its Horrible  and Cheaply Made

Why do you have to sign into a Microsoft account to use it for the privacy of your own home ??
1. For all Intensive purposes They are a monopoly.
Why does the Phone recording have a very nice clear and concise Articulate American Voice  but then you end up with 3rd world country folks who you can barely understand ?
2.  Windows 10 is Extremely Intrusive The 'Cortana speaker app can track and profile  all of your activities and you freely give that information to Microsoft and you can't delete it  .

3 You are forced to sign into a Microsoft App for Widows 10 and For Windows Office products.

The Picture /art program is horrible as is the writer and you again cannot delete it.

4. Windows Office 2016, YOU CANNOT DOWNLOAD WHAT YOU WANT  YOU MUST DOWN LOAD THE WHOLE PROGRAM  ITS  CHEAP looking compared to office 2000 .  No Color schemes Makes you sign into a Microsoft Account, as a matter of fact Your E-Mail address appears on top of Word ,Excel and Not to mention the One Note that  deceitfully makes you sign into it to use it not knowing anyone on the internet can read what jot down

"I love this product. It's so easy to create web sites, brochures, posters, just about anything. We even created our wedding menus for the tables with this product - it's awesome!"
"The cadence is a bit odd, and the narrator uses a word that does not exist- ""litten"" but the overall meditation is terrific. I felt a huge shift after the first or second listen. It is really good. I easily overlook, and find myself smiling during, the meditation. It is clever and imaginative...very fun!"
Good value if you are looking for protection for the whole house. Got the email and set up the accounts.

"This was disappointing. After Backyard Baseball was a tremendous hit with our 4-year old. Backyard Basketball doesn't live up to the Baseball game. My son & I were both expecting another 30+ professional players that we could learn their names and statistics together. Instead, unike the Backyard Baseball, this product isn't endorsed by the NBA as significantly. It would be great if the software maker put out updates each year so that we could buy another set of players to add to the roster to pick from each year. In general, I'd highly recommend the Backyard Series of PC Games, kid's love them, and they put hours of time into learning how to use them. After getting past the initial disappointment of only learning Kevin Garnett's name, we still enjoyed this game."
Worked great for new motherboard/processor.
"easy to use and always thorough. the largest refund that you can get, doing your own taxes"
Very nice capabilities and a major improvement over the X3 version I was using.  A user's manual would be handy as they are doing what a lot of companies  are and that is placing the help on the Internet.
"Only works with computers, no audio for use in car or cd player"
"This is a very good computer game. It is very hard, but fun!"
"If anyone is going to work with pictures,this program is a must. What a good deal! Never would I have believed that one could do so much to improve a lousy picture."
"Lately, my 4 year old daughter has been obsessed with computer games. I'm buying more games on CDs to decrease her exposure to the internet. She loves animals so I figured this would at least be mildly interesting. That turned out to be an understatement. She fell in love with it instantly.

There are four characters in the game and each has an animal friend. To play the game, you have to prepare each character and their animal for a pet parade by teaching the animal a trick, picking out clothes for the character, and designing a float for each pair. After each pair and their float is ready for the parade, you have to organize the parade and add special effects. Then, you start the parade and the program plays out the parade that you designed. The parade is actually pretty brief, but it can be played over and over as many times as you like.

The game can be quickly mastered by most children but has enough variety to encourage them to go back to repeat the tasks many times. There are a variety of clothing choices and float options. Even though it seems repetitious to me, my daughter doesn't seem to mind it - and she's very advanced with computer use. I've also noticed that when she goes back over and over to play the games where she teaches the animals their tricks for a specific parade, the game increases in difficulty so it's not monotonous. There are also several options for printables, including a cute friendship bracelet with your child's name on it.

This game certainly would not qualify as educational, although it does build good computer skills and hand/eye coordination. Overall, I would say it's just good, clean fun.

I gave this four stars because sometimes the program seems a little slow and there is a delay between screen changes. Also, you can't play the game without the CD in the disk drive, even after fully loading the game on the computer. This is a negative to me because for most kids, you would have to assist them with starting the game. However, my 4 year old has pretty much mastered inserting the CD, closing the drive drawer, and clicking on the program icon. I'm just not totally comfortable with her doing it when I'm not there. The last thing I need is to have a broken CD jammed in my computer..."
"I had the hard copy version of this installed for maybe 2 weeks, then, removed it. Originally, I did use the generous 90-day free evaluation time MS gives if you download it, and it did work okay, but for a few slight bugs, though I DID NOT elect to install the beta Defender, as I'd used that before and it was super unstable on my XP MCE, 2005 OS, and also showed many false positives. The $20.00 price on Amazon seemed like a very good deal, and my trial period was ending, so I picked it up. Upon reinstallation (My trial expired before the Amazon hard copy arrived, though not due to slow delivery, I cut it too close.), I had stability issues with it from day 1, and this time I did install Defender, which may be why, but I removed the entire program because of it. I'm just glad I didn't pay Bill G. the $50.00 list price! However, time changes things, and Defender is out of beta, I built a new rig, and so, I may give it another go, because I really like the idea of it, and the interfaces and settings and system info it provides. I'm a security freak anyway, with many other programs, however, I figured who know Windows better than MS, right? Besides, the anti-virus software it contains is one of the only ones that can run with many other AV programs, including my superb NOD32, so I liked the idea of having 2 actively running AV programs. Another drawback is the fact that it has automated defragging built into it, and you can't turn it off! If you don't want it to run, then, you MUST go into it's settings once a week and keep pushing up the day it runs, so that it doesn't. When I first got One Care, the auto defragstarted running, unbeknownst to me, while using the PC, and did that really destabilize my OS! Hmmmm, maybe 2 stars is too many just for the concept, and on second thought, maybe I won't reinstall it! Though, if you are new to PC's, don't have any other protection yet, this still might make a decent program for beginner's, plus it's liscensed to install on 3 PC's, good for home networks. Oh yeah, the one outstandingly good thing about it was the firewall would absolutely stop any new programs, both ways, until you decided to allow or disallow them, while most firewalls I've used react too slowly and any uploads or downloads have partially started before they reacted and sought your permission, which is WAY BAD NEWS. On that one feature, I give One Care 5 stars! You decide, but that's my biography on using it. At the very least, download the full trial version, and use it for 10 weeks or so, and if you have no problems and like, hey, the price to own it on Amazon can't be beat!"
"on two previous occasions I have met all the requirements to purchase a product and eventually the shop does not fulfill its promise without them having any penalty and any benefit to me as a buyer. the last store to which I refer is Cubamania 7. books they had to delivered (Rosetta Stone English (US) Levels 1,2,3,4 & 5 Set with Audio Companion.

could be a strategy some businesses place items at low prices only to find customers but their real interest is not to sell the product that could be for the following reasons:

a) may be a sales gimmick.
b) they may not have the product.
c) can be a person with two names of commerce and so find the best buyer and does not comply with the client prior commitment.

The truth is that. customers are left disappointed with the previous goals they have with the product, I call on amazon to observe these details are very disturbing and certainly could be less effective for its recognized name."
"The Business part of this software continues to have the same problems as the 2012 version.  That is that the fields, e.g. check boxes, radio buttons, and fill-in fields do not line up with the text that describes them.  This is very poor programming.... Why does H&R Block pay so little attention to detail?  Most of the time, I can figure out which field to use - but sometimes the text describing the fields overlays some of the fields...  It's ridiculous.  But so far I have not found another package that includes all the forms for both home and business that I need."
"In the middle of a recession, everyone is cutting back and trying to do more with less.  Contrary to the current economic winds, Intuit has launched a product that is doing less for more.  This is hardly the way to win friends and influence people.

Intuit needs to wake up and get back in touch with reality.  Otherwise they will lose out to their less costly competitors who understand what is going on and how to capitalize on it."
"I have had this program for over a year now or so, and use it quite frequently.  The search capabilities in this program are top-notch, as you can define very complex searches (ie: [God / Jesus] + [Christ / Lord] - cruc*] will result in all results that have God or Jesus AND Christ or Lord AND do not have any variation of cruc in it - like crucifixion, crucify ...).  Also, the resources on this program are very good - look at Biblesoft's website to see a complete listing of products.  Ok, now to what I don't like about the product.
1. They have a section in their options that states that they recomend you not change anything in this section, because ""2.1 Compatibility - these settings are required in PC Study Bible version 3.0 and above and should not be changed."" - why have them included in the options section then I ask you?
2. If you have user profiles enabled in Windows, the program only installs it's reg keys to the user profile you installed it with; this means that if you install it with the user profile of A, then restart the computer at a later time and sign in as user B, you will get an error message; there is a way around this - but you have to be knowledgable with the Windows registry - you have to manually copy the HKCU key for Biblesoft software to the user profile you want to use the program in.
3. Every time you copy a selection from one of the resources (ie: Strong's Concordance, Thayer's, Nave's ...) it will copy your selection AND AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDE copywrite info - this is very annoying I have found - I understand their reasons, but I believe they could have found a better way.
4. Add-ons are not free - look at add-on page ...for the cost, I would think they should be.
5. Some misc. bugs
All in all, if you're just going to use this software to do minor Biblical studies, then this might be useful software for you; if you are planning on delving deep into the Scriptures, I recommend you not purchase this.  I hear that Logos Bible Software is pretty complex - I have not checked it out myself, but I do know that this program is not all that I wanted in a program, and I am not satisfied for the price I paid for it."
My 4 1/2 year old daughter loves this package.  She enjoys changing Barbie's appearance and printing out her masterpieces.
Purchase this solfware for my small buisness but have problem with submitting my taxes.. Bad solfware.. Not recommend not worth it
"Wonderful product. It was easy to install even with my limited computer ability. So far I have tried IChat with my son and loved it. He was able to help me fix problems on my computer over the internet. Coverflow is great, I can see now review all my pictures/documents etc that I have on my computer a great time saver for finding things. I haven't tried Time Machine but, my son loves it. It does require you to own an external hard drive. It works as advertised. I think this is a great upgrade..."
Nice addition to my Imac.  Works as describe.  I am happy with purchase.  :)
It's office.....  For a Mac. It is what I expected. It would have been nice if I got more than one license if we have more than on Mac in a household. Works fine.
"As usual, simple to use and a good refund."
"this is no good.  no customer support.  three years now, and no e-file has ever worked.  the feds AND state rejected every claim.  2012 return never even got filed.  I had to re-file by paper.  Money wasted."
Second year of using it.  Better than the year before.  Be careful of not signing up for additonal uneeded upgrades (i.e. $20 optional charge to e-file state retrun)  Very highly recommended program and a good price through Amazon.
Does a good job wish I could buy another at this price.  Updated to the 2014 version without incident.
"I recently switched to a Mac from Windows and needed organizing software for all my bits of data and projects. I evaluated several and settled on the very powerful Circus Ponies Notebook. I am very happy with the product and cannot recommend it highly enough.

One word of warning, however: the user interface is not intuitive. I had a hard time figuring out how to manage my data for the first week. The upside is that the developers are very responsive to user questions and there is a helpful users' forum. I highly recommend new users watch all the instructional videos available on the Circus Ponies site.

The software is robust and reliable, as well as very flexible. I had a logicboard failure on my Mac and Notebook came through it without a problem, not always the case with database software. I was very impressed by how helpful the developers were, too.

Notebook makes it very easy to organize and share large amounts of complex data, both personal and professional, including clippings from the Internet and graphics. It is excellent and well supported software, robust enough for professional use."
I've been using H&R Tax program for over 6 years and I love it. I prepare 4 or more income tax filings every year.
loved it
I'm still learning how to work this program but it does really neat things. I'm going to like it more as I use it.
"Remarkably good for the money. I had my main video editor, a pro tool, fail completely. It shouldn't have happened but had to wait for their support center to open during the business week. I had to use Pinnacle Studio Ultimate 18 while I waited. I was surprised. It's actually quite good for the most part with an occasional bug here and there. But the software works, didn't crash and rendered videos quickly. It is pretty intuitive although I suggest you watch a video before you begin, many available on YouTube. The rendering was very quick and took advantage of my CPU. The number of FX for your videos is staggering. You can create monster videos with a real professional touch with this package and it's crazy when you think about how little the price is for such power.

There are some things that aren't perfect. I think rearranging could do better. I would like better snapping to timeline points or make it default. But there were so many smart things about the app that I liked, I have to give it credit where it's due. Runs perfectly on my i7-3770. You need some power for video encoding but there isn't much lag on my machine. Very happy."
"Great program! I use this to edit HD video shot on GoPro Hero3+ cameras for a show we make at my kid's school and I've gotten so used to it that I am now teaching 9-11 year olds to edit video with it. It's got all the bells and whistles from green screen for special effects, pan and zoom for correcting composition of shots, titling and transitions to make really nice looking videos. My computers were built with this program so my render times are fast and it all runs without a hitch. Your results will vary if your specs are not well into the recommended side of the spec-trum."
"Cannot be installed on Windows 7 even using XP compatibility mode, which usually works most other older Windows software packages."
"Snag works as described and is very simple to navigate. It also has several output options. I am very happy I choose Snag It over the other software because of the ease of use, simple design, and dependability."

What's not to love about Mavis Beacon? I learned some bad habits typing with two fingers. Thanks to Mavis Beacon I can now type faster and don't have to look at the keyboard.
Very disappointed that Intuit has changed their product and no longer include stock sales and purchased (Schedule D) as part of the Deluxe edition.  These is going to create quite a challenge for me.  They want us to upgrade to the Premier edition in order to get what I used to get with my Deluxe version.  I understand that they added State Tax submission for free instead which is something that I do not need.  I have to look closely at going to H&R Block.
"Has a number of ""bugs"" and little annoyance issues, but it gets the job done.  If you are a long term Quicken user it will do what you need, but don't expect it to run flawless."
Quark helped me troubleshoot it for Mavarick OSX. Works well.
Very satisfied with this purchase. A good investment.
"I build a lot of computers.  I used to install Norton AntiVirus 2003 on all of them.  On a recent build, Norton Internet Security 2005 came on the motherboard disk so I thought I'd give it a try.  First I tried loading it before other programs and it thru the annoying repair-not-supported error making you uninstall then reinstall it.  So, I uninstalled it and waited until the rest of the software was installed.  When I tried again, it brought the computer to it's knees!  When I tried to uninstall it, it just locked up forcing me to rebuild everything from scratch loosing 2 days of work!!!  Enter McAfee...  The install ran perfect, the updates ran perfect, and the software performs perfect.  I can't comment on the spam program because I uninstalled it since my server already catches 99% of all spam.  Until Norton learns to play nice with Windows XP SP2, I'd strongly recommend that you use McAfee!!!  Oh and one other thing, any security program will use resources.  If your computer slows down that much, you need a new computer!  The computer I installed it on boots in 20 seconds!  Also, some knowledge as to security programs in general is requred regardless of what you install.  Thinking you can install a security program and not take the time to set it up is pure foolishness.  Please don't blame McAfee!"
"I have used Quicken for many years and I've always liked the product.  This version is a nice upgrade and is probably worth it for any Quicken owner to pick it up.
I also picked up Microsoft Money 2002 since it had a great rebate from the wholesale store.  Money will convert Quicken 2001 files cleanly, so it was easy to compare the products.  Microsoft Money is different, but equally capable for the most part.  I recommend Microsoft Money to anyone who has not already become familiar with Quicken.  Money seems to be easier to learn and use than Quicken.  But if you are comfortable with Quicken, I don't see any real value in Money over Quicken to justify the learning curve.
WARNING!!!  I recently had a minor problem with a corrupt quicken file which I corrected.  It made me more consciences about running VALIDATE periodically.  Before upgrading to Quicken 2002, I ran Validate and Super-Validate and no problems were found.  After upgrading I ran Validate and Super-Validate again, with no problems.  I went online to update my register and post payments and then I ran Validate once again.  This time I had 167 errors.  I don't know what it ""fixed"", but I got really nervous.  I validated a second time, no problems.  I went online again the next day, then validated again, and more errors were found.  I hope that Quicken is just cleaning up some online garbage ... no apparent problems exist in my data ... just please run VALIDATE frequently to be extra safe, and run your backups too.
I also had a problem where I had duplicate scheduled payments in my Quicken schedule.  I was able to identify which payments were legitimate and which were not, so I cleaned up that mess.  This problem is addressed in the Quicken knowledgebase, albeit poorly addressed.
This makes three seperate data problems with Quicken.  One with Quicken 2001 and two with Quicken 2002.  All within the last two months.  All three were caused by Quicken, so I am getting nervous about trusting this company with my data.  I am running Validate frequently now and I recommend that you do too.
I like Quicken and I will continue to use it as long as I can continue to trust it with my data.  I like the new features in this upgrade.  Microsoft Money is a great product as well, but not worth the learning curve to switch.  If you do buy or use Quicken, just be extra careful to validate your data frequently."
"I'm still trying to find out if this software has any features that my other, free photo software doesn't have. So far I am disappointed but glad that it didn't cost me more. I use different software and none of it is perfect, but each has a feature that makes it valuable...still looking for this one. I bought it because of the name and I was hoping that it would be a worthy successor to its previous pre-Corel versions, but, so far, no."
"I love this product. I only hope it would have this feature that photoshop has, moving selection outline, instead of grapping the selection content and moving.
Great cheap software with lots of productivity power for 3d artists."
"For the record, I used Quickbooks 15 years ago, multi-user, for years.  When I got my business going again used QB SimpleStart with no problem on my vista 64 computer. Bought QB Pro 2010 two weeks ago and started adding data to it. Today I got a BSD and rebooted.  When I started QuickBooks I got the message ""QuickBooks has stopped working"".  So I de-installed and reinstalled Microsoft dot net, de-installed and reinstalled QuickBooks.  After the installation finished and I started Quickbooks, it still doesn't want to boot. Googled ""QuickBooks has stopped working"" and found lots of other users with similar problems. After having used this for two weeks, why should I be reinstalling?  The install disc can't even do a repair. How is it that a relatively basic type of product gets so bloated and unreliable after all of these years?  I sold accounting software on computers in the 80's (yes that was 25 years ago) and can't believe that in this day and age the most popular software continues to have so many problems. Intuit, you can try to contradict what I am saying, but know this.  There are lots of people that are mad at you due to the reliablity issues they experience with your product.  NO DENIAL, PLEASE.

Two months ago today my laptop was stolen out of my home. I received the laptop from school so it came with the lo-jack already installed. I contacted Lo-jack the same day the laptop was stolen and provided all the necessary information. As of today the laptop still has NOT been recovered. I have only received 2 emails from them regarding the status of my laptop. I called yesterday (and luckily I did because I wouldn't have known otherwise)and they said received a signal from it the day before that. I feel the information the rep gave me was very generic. After reading these other reviews I have to agree that this is not a good investment for protecting your laptop. You basically pay them to run everything on autopilot as someone else stated on here. I don't have high hopes for the recovery of my laptop and due to my unfortunate financial situation I won't be able to replace it anytime soon. Thanks Lo-jack.....for nothing.
"If you're seeing this in the under 30 range, I'll tell you that this is a great value for what comes in the package.  Even moreso than the latest version.  First off the download code for Sony Loop Collections is worth more than the whole package.  The code is value for all loops from Standard to Premium so it's a no brainer to buy this and get a Premium set.

As for the software, it's a great concept to be able to paint the areas on the tracks where you want your loops to play.  Added to that, you can compose using MIDI tracks and also use the built in chopper to cut your own loops.

It's not the best DAW overall but for laying down beat tracks, it's very tough to beat!"
The need to keep putting in the CD for art is crazy.  The support is horrible.  Just move on past this one....

"Bought this product so I can have access to writing a resume and cover letter. I am very impressed with all the stuff you get with this. I now have stationery, address envelopes, and make lists for all the things I do in life. Easy to use. I love it. Easy to install, no problems."
"I have been a loyal Quicken user for many years and am beginning to question why.  The three star rating is simply out of this loyalty.  If I did not have a history with Quicken this would have been a 1.  The new version, which I feel was forced on me, in order to continue direct downloads from my accounts, is both glitchy and functionally challenging.  The software has required a patch in the first two weeks I owned it and still continues to crash regularly.  This is very disappointing considering I never had any issues with the previous versions.  I am normally a pro new version type of guy, but this is sub-standard and probably should not have made it to market yet.  It may be time to start looking for other products."
Works great on an HTC one and a Samsung tab S.  I've used Webroot for 3 years and have never had an infection on any of my computers.
"Software downloaded quickly, easy to use, covered all bases, pulled my previous years info from 2013 return on my PC, helpful info if you have questions, love the interactive score board showing your refund in green or in red for what you will owe IRS from beginning to end, reviewed my return for accuracy & potential for Audits. Jumped right into my State return...Worked perfectly, no issues what so ever. EFiled (accepted by the IRS within 2hrs) notified by email, PDF copy on my PC for records, plus I printed out hard copy for my file.  Only left my desk for coffee & donuts!"
"I've had Windows XP for a year now and it's probably the best OS that Microsoft has put out so far. The major difference in this version compared to it's predecessors is the new interface. At first, I was skeptical of the new design because it looked a little too user-friendly for my liking but I got used to it quickly. The colors are vibrant and they make a difference in the attraction of this product.

This operating system is much more stable than the other versions, too. Windows Me was the first OS that I ever used but I always felt that it left much to be desired. The stability was bad, the omnipresent blue screen of death (if you've had Me, you'll know what I am talking about) came up often, and it seemed so much like a Windows 98 3rd Edition instead of Me after I tried out 98. Fortunately, This blue screen of death is absent from this version. Compared to the other versions, this is like a Godsend.

If you are sick of unstability or just want to upgrade, go for this product."
This years version of Turbo Tax was a great dissipointment.  We are inclined to go to a pro next year.
"Arrived when expected; meets my needs.

Still exploring changes from 2010 version;

To much space in registers allowd for tags, I don't use tags, should be option.

Would like more flexiblity in customizing Reports; would really appreciate capability to design my own formats.

Experienced Quicken user."
great
"This is the second time I have purchased this software and it works very well to protect my computer .
When I need new software I will again renew with Norton again next year ."
"Aside from the overall price after filing, I've used turbotax for years and have been fairly happy.  I have a rental property and uncomplicated investments."
"I used TI Home 10 for years and it was very good - except having to set the BIOS to compatibility mode to recover.  TI Home 2012 is junk.  Acronis doesn't respond when you request a trial SN.  When you buy it you get the big picture; BSODs and phones home every single time you invoke it to check licensing.  Removed TI Home 2012 from Win7 Pro and the BSODs are gone.

If you ignore the reviews make certain to use it well before the 30 day money back is expired.

Quite frankly Paragon B & R 11 is stable, they've a 30 day trial download, and it actually works."
"I've used Zone Alarm for 3 years - the latest version was quite annoying but the update solved the problem. Zone Alarm gives a lot of control, but you have to learn it like any program. The complaints I see are from people who don't quite understand the inherent power of the program giving you complete control of how you protect your computer. Its like using word - the first time you use it - figure out the nuances.

It is true that Zone Alarm asks a lot of quesions, and you can figure out what you want to start and not start. You can turn off options and otherwise you can let it control. I've uninstalled it without problems. BlackICe is very similar - but I like Zone Alarms interface better. You can also use program control to select what options for a program to run and to shut down worms. Its a powerful program - but like any elite program you have to spend time to learn it - (or run it blind)."
"As a new business owner, I needed a system that was flexible and easy to use. QuickBooks Pro has exceeded my expectations with its clear instructions and easy to understand categories of expenditure."
"I have used SuSE linux since their release 5.2.  Version 9.0 installed and worked flawlessly.  Version 9.1, which I installed clean, not an update, seemed to install without problems, but there are problems configuring the scanner (the same scanner I have been using with all the previous releases), the sound system, and the screensaver.
My sound card is the very common Creative Audigy 2.  This worked under 9.0 with no problems other than that not all features of the card were yet supported.  Under 9.1, /var/log/boot.msg shows that the sound system starts, I have configured to card with YAST, but there is no sound.
The scanner is an old Microtek X6EL scsi scanner.  The boot log shows that the scsi card, and the scanner are recognized.  Yet, when I try to use YAST to configure the scanner, no scanner is found.  When I try to configure a scsi scanner manually, no scsi devices are found.
Yes, the 2.6 kernel is faster -- I have already had to download two replacement kernels, for security reasons, however.  The new KDE gui is a little annoying for those of us who don't want it to be more window-like.  On the other hand, YAST has worked so well for the last several versions, that I don't even know where all the configuration files are (they've moved them, don't you know), and have no real desire to edit them by hand again, anyway.
Therefore, I'm afraid I'm not very happy with what Novel has done with my beloved SuSE.  Oh, yeah, the screensaver doesn't work either."
"On my recent trip to Portugal, the Garmin city navigator came in very handy.  It may not always have been the most accurate but it got us close enough to find what we were looking for.  I would definitely recommend it."
"Since I used this product in prior years, I was not surprised that it was very easy to complete my uncomplicated Federal & State tax returns.  What was shocking was that the program crashed whenever I selected ""File Paper Return"" and clicked on the ""Print Return"" button.  To compound the problem, H&R Block customer support told me that the version I purchased did not have the capability to print.  I couldn't accept that and subsequently I was able to print my returns directly from the Forms menu. I believe this is just a bug in the 2010 software and that the H&R Block technicians I reached weren't very competent. I will be looking at other tax software next year."
"Again I got burnt by Roxio, 5.0 now 8 is worse. I have Roxio screen

images I cant erase. Super slow and after all that waiting it

crapped out on me, I used Nero 6.6 took 4 minutes better interface.

I will never accept 5 stars reviews when there are more then 2

1/2 stars present. Lesson learned."
"There is absolutely no value to this product.  You can download and burn the Ubuntu and Kubuntu installation disks for free from the Ubuntu website.  The disks that come with this aren't even bootable.  The ""Introduction to Linux"" video is a bad joke.  Most of the time is spent explaining why GUIs are bad while a static image of an ad for their training course is on the screen.  Terrible.  Shameful."
I usually buy The internet version.  The 360 really seems to slow our computers down.  Our laptop has tons of issues it has never had before.  Mostly Google Crome not responding.  This happens several times a day.
Not as crash proof as former versions
"A favourite past time of mine that I have shared with my kids. If we could pause/save progress, I would rate it higher."
Yes
"I like the new interface with Quicken 2010 but have noticed it takes considerably longer to run updates on my accounts, compared to my older version of Quicken Deluxe 2008.  I'm still using the same checking/savings/brokerage accounts I had previously with the 2008 version, so I'm not sure why there's an increased time to download transactions and stock prices.  I have been a Quicken user for almost 10 years."
"Since installing it, my pc has slowed down to a crawl.  After a short time a critical error message came up that says it wants to perform a full system scan.  Well, I have a very large hard drive and a full system scan is unecessary every 30 days and takes about 8 hours.  It gives me no option to either change the schedule or continue to slow up my startup while it determines that I still haven't done the scan.  I don't need this!  I am going to uninstall it."
My rating reflects my displeasure at having to purchase two turbos because the deluxe version had bee removed and replaced with the basic version.  Any future purchases will be. Made in store where the item can be checked.  What happened to the free state efile?
"You can accomplish the same thing if you have a DVD recorder, an old camcorder or tape deck, and a set of RCA cables. Nothing fancy or new here. I was a bit disappointed. No boost in the quality either. It is what it is."
"This product is definitely worth what you pay for it. I purchased the product from another retailer a few years ago
and use Personal Record Keeper as the end to all means to document financial records, personal information, and keep
a general ledger for all of my accounts.

It is best used as an organizer for any assets one may have then distribute a copy of the database to interested parties. Those interested parties can be trustees, executors, relatives, or even your insurance agents to inform them of your possessions, how to access them, and where to locate them when needed especially in case of an emergency.

The only real limitation is that you cannot add pictures to an account, the software is old and probably no longer supported (if you should ever need support for such a simple program), no dedicated entry for an item's serial number (however, one can use another text column), and I have not tried the program on Vista nor Windows 7 as of yet!

There are many other similar programs but for the money this one is perfect."
"It was on sale so I thought I'd give it a try. This is maybe the best thing ever and is a very simple version of photoshop 5. It doesn't have all the features of photoshop but,  it is very nice and sort of easy to use- but that's just me having to get used to it."
"Waste of money if you have online membership. When it copied over the tree, the links I'd attached don't show right and are a pain to find and reopen. Not very user friendly, too much going on with it,"
Difficult to use.
Very useful software
works somewhat with my business but not using now
"Our 5 year old spends hours with this!  He can speak it very well, and read it too.  However, our son is very language-oriented so maybe this would be more of a challenge for the average learner.  I only wish I had boughten him a MORE challenging cd that would take him further.  He loved it anyway!"
Works very well. I had purchased this product years ago and it was to hard to use. They have improved it a lot.
good
"I used to be a big TT person but switched to HR Block the last few years. This was mostly because it was half the price (on sale). Initially though HRB was harder to use than TT and it was not as good. Kept thinking of going back, so decided to try it again. I am not really sure it is is any better than HRB...the interface has changed, question process, and how deductions are done. It also does not import 100% of the HRB previous year's data (HRB probably does the same with TT). It cost me a couple of hours typing in all my deductions and other data. I think they are pretty much similar (until you have an IRS issue?), so find one you like and stick with it....for most of us either would do fine."
"Great improvements in speed and usability make this edition of VMware the best yet.  Finally, relative pathnames for the configuration files and virtual drives, no more editing the config file every time you pull a VM down from the file server or move it to another computer.  Simply move the parent directory of your VM to any location or any other machine and it will run as though nothing has changed.  If you're a current VMware user, this is worth the upgrade cost.  If you're new to virtual machine technology make sure you give this product a very close look."
"I have to agree with the others who find this product far inferior to the Windows version. Why can't they both have the same layout and features? I used Quicken for years on Windows without any problems. I am now stuck with this version of Quicken, which just stinks."
Used it--worked fine!
"Windows 10 is still junk. Constant networking issues. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Very unreliable. Microsoft products are complete trash. The ONLY reason I even consider Windows is because I'm forced to use it to play certain games. But a few games are not worth the headaches Windows brings. All of my PCs will be running Linux soon. Do not buy Windows spyware! Watch Linux tutorials and download it for free. You can thank me later."
"Using the software it seemed like something exciting was going on but I don't really think it helps your reading speed.  There are performance trackers in the software that are supposed to track your imporvement.  Except the software fails if you do not ""improve.""  It's rigged.  Processing a refund was difficult.  The agent kept trying to delay the inevitable with alternative offers.  Just let me move on with my life!"
"Pretty easy to use if you can finally figure out how to download the software....It comes with two programs, Movie Studio and a DVD Management program.  Make sure you download the Amazon software download app first before downloading this software."
"It seems this code will not work to renew an existing subscription, only for creating a new account. Wish I had known that, as I would not have purchased this. Microsoft tech support was not helpful at all resolving the problem. But I like the product and recommend it. The ability to install Office on multiple devices in the same household is great."
"Quick and easy to use. Subscription was a renewal, Again, Amazon's price was the best by far."
"Unfortunately, for the consumer, Microsoft has changed it's business model on software, and I get that. I have used an Office product for decades and am absolutely confident in its reliability, so I will continue to lease it on an annual basis."
Nice product.  Good for the price.  Easy to install and use.
"My first beef is with Amazon for not allowing a ""no star""!!! QE for Mac is a pathetic and noxious product that pretty much does nothing. After waiting for five years or so to see a new Mac Quicken, we go back to check register management. You cannot track anything!!! You cannot export data to TurboTax. This thing is an abomination.

I guess you can tell i'm upset--steer clear of this. Intuit bought Mint so that they could sell it. This is it. What you had before for free you now have at a cost and at a significantly less functionality than with Quicken."
"I did not receive the correct product.  Upon installing, which is not working properly at all, it appears that I have been sent a Turbotax Basic instead of Deluxe, with a Deluxe Label.  Now I find that I have missed the return window by one week so there I can do about this.  Very disappointing."
"I have never been so disappointed as I am with Amazon right now.
The software that I ordered showed up almost destroyed, but I got the disk to work.

All seemed well until I tried to register the product, and then I found out that it was still registered to the previous owner, rendering my installation and the work that I had done on QB null.

This adventure has cost me time, the cost of the dubious software, and immeasurable damage to the accounting of my company.

Very, very disappointed.  The seller has not responded to my inquiry.  Will be seeking action through American Express over this if it is not resolved by the end of business day today (Monday 4-26-10)."
"I have used Turbo Tax for years, with exception of a few years trying some other type and paying $$ to have my taxed done for me.  I have been back with Turbo Tax for 5-years or so and very impressed with the year by year improvement of the UI.  Not only is Turbo Tax easy to use it gives confidence that what you are entering is handled properly and in your favor.  It's great to see the refund amount as you progress through the tax program.  Especially great to see that number increase as you go...a great motivator to stick with it and get it done.
You still have to have your information organized which can be a daunting task in itself.  Once you have everything organized, using Turbo Tax is super easy."
"I received this at a reduced cost for a review. The disk worked OK I think, it did a scan and had a list of things pop up but I never cold figure out how to either delete them or restore them. Heck I couldn't figure out what they were. It's defiantly not for a computer ungenious. Needs more or any instructions"
Works great!!
"Seems to run faster and lighter than Windows 7. Generally more aesthetically pleasing. Not particularly intuitive and takes some getting used to but it's fine after that. Don't believe the detractors who were convinced the OS was junk before they tried it, Windows 8 isn't a sign of the end times and it's not a reason for everyone to flee to Linux in a panic. There's no particularly compelling reason to upgrade but if you like exploring new things and aren't particularly attached to the start button give it a shot."
Good
"I have attempted several times to purchase this download.  The purchase won't even go through, so therefore I can't rate the product itself.  Very disappointed."
I like it because it covers some of my devices but not all of them. I'll have to buy another.
"Quicken, according to which one best suits one's needs, is a very thorough and helpful way to keep track of Income & Expenses for one's needs and Tax Preparations. When utilized fully, it also becomes more helpful when coordinating with TurboTax."
"Only useful if you already had Microsoft Office, would not work as a stand alone application.  Luckily it didn't cost much."
Yes.all you need for all your devices...
"I have been using this product for 3 months on my HP Pavillion with a Maxtor external back up. It works great, and I can access and restore any file easily."
"Did not resolve anything. Waste of money, false advertising.

HP laptop HD crashed that had Windows Vista on it. replaced HD and tried to use these ""Automatic Driver Recovery Discs to recover OS on machine.  These did absolutely nothing."
Great for all your media needs
"Software program is great, very happy with it, it makes research and studying  easier. Thanks!"
"Payroll is very easy with this.  I've been using Quickbooks for 11 years.  The tracking of vacation and sick isn't the best for our audit and that's why I give it only 4 stars.  Otherwise, it's a 5."
"I just tried to download Taxcut 2008 (4/11/09). Following other people's suggestion, I installed Amazon's software downloader first, then downloaded a free game. When it all worked, I purchased the Taxcut software. Guess what? Didn't work. It kept trying to download for the longest time, and said there was a problem with the order. Apparently, what they don't tell you is that once you place an order with a credit card, especially on a weekend or evening hours, someone at Amazon needs to physically check on the credit card before releasing the order. So the order appears as ""Pending"" until Monday morning. Your order is not released until then. This is inane; what is the point of ordering something for instant download, and then waiting for two days until some moron at Amazon physically clears the credit card? I wish I had not ordered this, and instead just gone to my local BestBuy to get the CD version. Won't be buying software from Amazon in the future, I guess!!! I suspect the reviewers who report having no problems with the download are the ones who downloaded the software during normal business hours (M-F 9-5). Those who try purchasing over the weekend or overnight are screwed. I thought Amazon was smarter than this!!!!"
"TurboTax cannot handle complicated Academic Fellowship income (unreported and not on a w-2, and that is not for a qualifying educational expense). They refer you to the intracacies of IRS Pub 970 because their programming cannot ask you the pertenant questions to figure out your specific scenario. Be ware. If you go the TT route, check the final return to make sure that the program hasn't assumed that you have SE (self-employment) income. Also, I tried to use telephone support and their technician had absolutely no idea what I was talking about. Worse is that they gave me the run around, wouldn't listen, and wouldn't put me in touch with more experienced, supervisory staff. I was merely trying to assist them with a weakness in their software to create a better product. If you don't have complicated employment income, Turbo Tax is an excellent product."
"Not bad for free, but, of course, it comes with Amazon's baggage: a lot of unwanted ""recommendations"" for a multitude of other items supposedly similar to the ones purchased."
Use it everyday and recommend it to anyone who does not use it in their business!!
"This new version of MasterCook is the best yet. Many small improvements and several big ones, including the ability to share recipes with pictures, and a vastly improved web import function. There has always been good support through the MasterCookDiscussion group on YahooGroups, but for the first time in many years, official support from MasterCook is back and is terrific - the new owners at Cosmi Valusoft are tremendously responsive, and have committed to ongoing development. They've already released new improvements since this version was released for download from the Cosmi Valusoft website in June. The program just works well, and is a great value. This retail version would make a great gift, and I'm seriously considering giving it to all the cooks in my family this Christmas. Full disclosure: I was a beta tester for this version but received no compensation for writing this review. Highly recommended."
worked well
"I've used, loved and recommended Turbotax for over a decade.  This year -- ouch.  It wouldn't install and I received an error code.  Went to the support site and followed every suggestion.  Wouldn't install.  Another ""solution"" was posted that didn't work for me.

When I called support -- I was told that there was no solution, but their team is working on resolving ""this and many other problems, because a lot of changes were made to the program this year.""

A very, very painful process, and I still haven't gotten the program to install.  If you decide to buy TurboTax, hope you have better fortune with it than I have."
"I will start this review by saying that I like all Chief Architect products. They are easy to use and deliver great results. However, I have a problem with the way they tier their Home Designer product line. At the top of the line you have the Pro version, which has all the tools available. That's also the only available trial download if you want to try before you buy. You also have several tiers under the Pro version with a decreasing feature set for every notch down that you take. But you can't try those. Looking at the detailed feature comparison matrix on their website, I found the Architectural version to be the best bang for my bucks, since per the matrix I was only giving up on advanced tools. I'm pretty sure you must be thinking the same or you wouldn't be reading this review.

I was wrong.

I purchased the Architectural version thinking that I would be able to model my simple standard Dutch Colonial Revival home. Well I can't. The Architectural version is missing crucial roofing tools, which prevented me from completing my roof. I asked for help on their support forum and I was told that in order to complete my roof I had to use the Pro version at 500 bucks. Now again this is a very common roofing style in the Northeast, nothing fancy or out of the ordinary. But it has dormers and in order to fully control those you need the Pro version.

Aside from the roof, many other less-crucial tools are missing, such as half the camera options (no orthogonal views, no texture showing in vector view) and many other irritating omissions I can live with. After all they need to justify the premium for the Pro option.

If their matrix had stated that half the roofing tools are missing I would have probably not purchased the Architectural version. I would have gone for the Pro version (ouch) or the product of a competitor (hint: Punch!).

So in conclusion, the Pro version is a good product, Architectural a lot less so. If your needs are so simple that you don't need the roofing tools in Pro, I suggest you instead look at free software such as Google SketchUp or even Autodesk Homestyler. As far as I'm concerned I will have to upgrade to Pro, a little bitterly I must say."
Great reinforcement of how a girl or woman should look.  Recommend looking at challenging games based on math or science.  Expect better from your kids and you just may get it.
"Corel Draw is a venerable drawing program which I have been using for more than 15 years, back when it was a 16-bit Windows program.  It is impossible to give a description of its many features and capabilities, except to say that it has everything I need and a whole lot more.  It is capable of accurate and scaled technical drawing; it can also be very expressive.  And if vector drawing is not enough, it comes with an image manipulation program too.

I was dismayed when I installed release X6 and found it  REALLY pokey (waiting a second or two for most operations, including simply drawing a rectangle), and my quad-processor 16GB W64 system is reasonly high power.  I was further dismayed when trying to scroll-select off the bottom of the screen (which should cause autoscrolling to occur until you move the cursor back into the window) hung the program; I had to kill it from Windows Task Manager.  Despite all the wondrous features of the program, it was nearly unusable, and I was about to post a 2-star review.

But the other day when I started it up, it offered Update 2, which claimed to address performance and stability issues.  It does!  Performance is good, and so far, at least, no hangs or crashes.

I would give it five stars, except that it does not still include the large clip-art and font libraries that it had 10 years ago, and though I still have these, some at least are not compatible with the current version.  I'm taking a star off for that.

It also does not support 3-d drawing, the way a CAD program or (ex-Google) Sketchup does.  Sketchup, in particular, is free (for the entry-level version), and is great for drawing 3-d models of things I want to build.  Sketchup, like Corel, does an excellent job of mapping screen/print dimensions to real-world, a feature that is very important to me.

Otherwise, for a full-featured drawing program, it's pretty much Corel Draw or Adobe Illustrator, both of which I think are top notch, though I have not fully explored Illustrator.  I'm still happy with Corel and am glad that they are keeping it  current, including support for 64-bit Windows."
It works great.
Got this to go with Huion drawing tablet. Works wonderfully. Has tons of neat features.
"Amazon's big bonus. See it here http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1001914211
You get $8 off Norton which they try to pawn off on everyone who buys a PC. Never wanted it before. Don't want it now. Thanks a lot."
Great product
"It is excellent. For many many users, this is all they will ever need."
"I was expecting MS Outlook to be part of the package. It was not included. I wanted to upgrade Outllook on one of my computers. I was very disappointed that it was not included.

The offer from Amazon was not clear."
it worth the money for sure
"I purchased this version of RentRight and then purchased an upgrade to Next Generation. The product is built on a powerful database which the programmers constantly update. I've experience a few bugs but their updates and technical support have worked them all out.

If you use cash basis as your accounting method, be careful. This product is written to be accrual basis only. It forces double entry accounting so your financials have some built in controls. A small landlord may not need this. If you are small and plan to grow, this is still a good product because it is tough to change from cash basis to accrual basis later.

The user interface is clean. It could be easier to navigate but with a little time, it makes sense. The reporting is strong and the ability to merge letters is nice.

My experience with this software was a bit frustrating at first but I have definately grown to like it."
"Scansoft's promise of 99% accuracy is dead on if the only thing you want to scan is pure text.  This product is garbage if you choose to scan tables.  Oddly table and column recognition were supposed to be the most touted improvements.  In my opinion, nothing has changed since Textbridge 98.  The text recognition is excellent.  But everything else is GARBAGE!  Much as is my rating of this product!  $372.99 of PURE GARBAGE."
"Originally bought TurboTax Deluxe thinking all Turbo Tax Deluxes where the same.  THEY ARE NOT.  This turbo tax includes software for filing a state tax form as well as the federal.  Both packages look the same (prices are different) but the wording under TurboTax with explicitly say ... and state tax filing.  Without those words, you only get Federal Tax."

"Norton is currently the best on the market for me.
I've spent monies on other security softwares, but truly
feel a safety with Norton's protection.  I know
others become irritated with the pop up messages from
Norton revealing ahead of time if a site is safe or
not, etc., but I have come to rely on those popups.  They
do not bother me.  I continue to purchase Norton year after
year, but is open to being introduced to something better.
Right now........it's Norton for me."
It does everything I expected and I'm so happy with it.  I love anything that will make my quilting life easier!

"Received as described , genuine Kaspersky . Loaded into computer with no problems at all. Received item on time as expected. Kaspersky is a good product . I  have been using this product for the last  4 years. I would purchase this item again."

"I see at least two of the reviews that are positive are obviously professionally written reviews.

DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY.  It's NO BETTER than any other piece of software and the cost is WAY TOO MUCH!  I speak 4 languages and purchased the Mandarin Chinese from Rosetta Stone.  This is coming from someone who has learned 3 other languages ON MY OWN and I WARN YOU, DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY!"
"First off, I have been using Windows Vista Ultimate since RC2 and I have to say that I LOVE it. I recently bought my first 8800GTX DX10 card and IT IS AMAZING!

Sure there are issues with Vista but remember XP? There were the exact same issues and look where that stands now. You will never experience DX10 if you do not upgrade..

If you buy and install Vista Ultimate but don't like some of the features or something is not working right, research it...fix it...don't just complain!!  Nothing is 100% satisfactory to some people so, less complaining and, if you have a problem with this OS or Microsoft in general, then go to Mac or Linux (guaranteed that you will not be able to run much of anything on them). Have fun and BUY IT!"
the vegas software i love. i edit with this software every day it works great every i need in a new software
accurate description. i love this product. It does everything for my computer that the description stated.
"I have a lot of the Freddi Fish games for my grandkids and we love them....except for this one.  It is too hard and I can't even solve it when I play with them.  I have put it to the side because it isn't fun, it is frustrating.  This is not due to the seller, but due to the designer who made the game.  Try some of the other Freddi Fish games.  We have one about The Haunted Schoolhouse one about The Case of The Stolen Conch Shell and a third about Missing Kelp Seeds.  Those aren't the exact titles, but you can find them doing a search with those words.  I highly recommend all 3 of those.  They are educational as well as fun.  In the Stolen Conch Shell game the maker designed it so there are different versions of the game on the same cd.  In other words, you can't memorize it because the clues change.  I like that one best.  The Haunted Schoolhouse also has a different version.  I think the Kelp Seed game only has one version on it...at least that's all we've played.  The other two games randomly change and you never know which set of clues you will get.

This is a good game to teach young kids (4 up to ?) how to use the mouse and get familiar with simple computer functions.  It is also a mental challenge.  An adult has to 'help' because a young kid won't know until they get old enough to figure it out for themselves.  It is good for the adult to interact because you get the opportunity to teach the child you love how to use a computer and it is fun doing it."
"I have used H&R Block software for several years because I find the TurboTax alternative annoying and overpriced. As an experienced system builder and software writer I figured I would be relatively immune to the install problems others have reported here with Windows 7. Well I was wrong. HRB did install in my Win 7 - 64bit system, and I did manage to import last years business return and create W-2's for employees and a W-3 for this year - just. Then it stopped working. Would not start (even when running as admin), yet refuses to uninstall because it claims to be still running; will install in XP virtual machine but then cannot access files I have already created in the 'real' Win-7 machine. I can deal with these issues, but I shouldn't have to. Most of them are peculiar to my own machine it is true, but software for release into the real world must be written and QC'd to handle all sorts of individual system quirks. Maybe it's 'OK' if something like a game doesn't run on some systems, or needs special tweaking, but it's inexcusable for mission-critical software like TaxCut. And if the system interface has been poorly QC'd there are obvious questions about how well the tax rules and computations have been checked. The HRB software is far from ready for release to the general public. In my own case, having handled (barely) everything I absolutely needed to get done by Jan 31, and fortunately having saved hardcopies of everything, I will probably sit tight and see what happens with updates of HRB, but unless there's a BIG improvement in its stability in Win 7 in the next month or so I'd guess I'll be doing my final taxes in TurboTax, much as I hate the thought. I recommend that you stay away from this software at least on a 64-bit Win 7 system."
great
"TaxCut installs third party software without your knowledge, consent or permission. The application is called Software995 and it's basically a PDF editor. Why anyone would need a PDF editor to do their taxes is something TaxCut refuses to answer. Software995 is covertly installed when you download updates for TaxCut. Sorry, you get Software995 installed without choice.
Software995 is ad-based. So if you intend on using it, you will have to endure endless popup ads from their sponsors. And no, you can't get rid of them using a popup blocker. To eliminate the ads you have to pay $9.95.
I think it's very unprofessional of H&R Block to shove 3rd party software down it's customers throats. Are they that hard up for money?
TaxCut and TuboTax both work as far as getting the job done. So my advice would be to get the one without adware."
GR8 But Its a LITTLE hard for beginners but i got the hang of it after a while  so i would get this for any anime project
"Eats CPU time, slows down hard disk, no support from Norton. Switched to Avast eventually, has the same features for free and it doesn't block CPU and HDD."
Don't wast your  There is nothing you cant learn from just useing quick books
This was the 2nd one I bought as the first one did not work at all. We just got back from our cruise that I bought this for. Only half of the map worked which sucked as we really could have used a GPS for navigating our way around France. Just tried to return it but they said it was to late. Don't waste your money on the map for France. The ones I bought for Italy and Turkey worked fine
Solid productivity tool.  Let me migrate from earlier versions of Word for Windows that I had been using with Parallels on my iMac.
"This upgrade was easy to use, but you cannot go from a 32 bit system to a 64. Whatever system you are running is the file that will download. If you wish to go to 64 bit, you must upgrade from a 64 bit. There is no way to get around this. It cannot be hacked. Otherwise, very easy install."
"My original Review had this at 2 stars.
I've upgraded it to 5.
The reason for the original review was because, although the software is beautiful streamline and pretty much free of crashes, it was rendering all my movies without sound.
I finally got connected with Sony support and they resolved the issue:
So, for all of you who are experiencing the same thing, here's what you do:
Although, I find this setup a little illogical, unlike other programs, this one has the rendering settings to default WITHOUT sound. You have to go into an advanced setting to render with sound.
When rendering click the ADVANCED button and choose a format and template (IE Program Stream NTSC Widescreen) and then click the CUSTOMIZE TEMPLATE button. Then click the AUDIO tab. Check INCLUDE AUDIO STREAM.
CLICK OK.
What I did, was SAVE this setting as a template and now I don't have to worry about it anymore. The SAVE feature is at the top of the Customize Window. (see image I included with review.)
About the software:
I'm comparing it to Premiere and Pinnacle Studio.
My problem with Pinnacle is that they have AWFUL customer service. The software is bloated and crashes in the middle of every project. They have a 14 day window for customer service and , after that, charge you if you need to speak to them. (What???!) Pinnacle used to be a great software program and then they made it overly complex and overloaded with features.
Adobe Premiere is very professional and loaded with cool features, but it's got a very unfriendly user interface for the ""average Joe"" who wants to edit cool looking home movies.
SONY's program is very clean looking. The buttons are big and the user interface is not cluttered.
You want a transition, click one. ( in Pinnacle it's an Easter-egg hunt every time I need to add an effect... and then it crashes.)
The rendering is a bit slower than the other programs, but who cares? As long as it renders right.
I'm upgrading to the Movie Studio ""Suite"" version so I can get the other programs in the bundle and the FX packages.
Once I got connected with Customer service, I have to say, I was really impressed. The guy qualified the problem, he looked at a sample file and came back with the answer i needed."
"I have had sooo many issues with mac 2011.  Do not get it.  Stay with 2010.  They have too many issues they need to work on.  I have sent my file in twice to get ""repaired"".  I still cannot download transactions properly."
"Been trying to get this working for a week. We have the unlimited plan but the app won't install. It took support several days to get back to us to tell us developers had released a new version and to download and install it. SAME EXACT problem and when we contacted them support said, Upon checking with our Technical Team, I see that they are still working on it.  So our unlimited plan is limited to uploading files smaller than 2gb because you need the app to upload larger files. What a joke."
"If your young kids have phones (and they all do), do yourself a favor and monitor their texts.  It may not stop every bad text, but it will at least make them think twice about what they send, which is definitely worth the price."
I've used it for years and it is quick and easy.
This was exactly what i expected.. Office for mac was easy to download and doesn't require any constant updates. Solid!
I was never able to update the software after days of trying and found no help anywhere.
"I needed to update from Windows Vista. I am not technically savvy, but I must say the download was totally pain free. I will warn you, though, to be sure and save anything from your old system onto an external drive.  Otherwise, you'll lose it once you update. Overall, Windows 10 is user friendly. I didn't give it 5 stars because it seems a little ""busier"" than the other versions. I also think they should lower the price. $169 is steep. But, I needed it, and am happy I finally upgraded. So far, so good."
"I used to do ALL of my husband's business books MANUALLY.  My accountant tried for years to get me to convert to a computer.  I finally did 10 years ago, to Quickbooks, and am forever grateful for the TIME I have saved, not to mention all the benefits of the program.  My absolute favorite thing about QB:  I can connect over the net with my accountant, who is QB certified and helps me with all of my QB problems!  No more making appts, having to have her drive to our office to help!  She can connect virtually anywhere and help me anytime!

I love QB and am always quick to recommend the program to friends or acquaintances!"
Perfect for our 16 year old son. Love that it can be hidden.
"Block is the way to go, it is easy, comprehensive, and is the best solution for more complex tax situations."
"I really like the new Word desktop publishing software and have had absolutely no problems using it on my Mac. I write a lot, so I have really exercized that package. I  used the docx format and like the new image manipulation features, although I may have to convert to doc or pdf format to share with others. It also handled my old doc format documents gracefully. It was a good investment for a lightning deal. The package includes other software, like Excel, which is always good to have, but I can't say that I have tried any of the software beyond Word. The only complaint I have so far is that the update that I needed to take after installing the software was huge and even timed out on my first attempt. Thank goodness I have a broadband connection, or I would have had to order the update on a CD. That tells me that they released the software with inadequate testing."
"Not available to Customers outside of USA, well Mcafee, I am not paying the $90 you want me to pay for living outside of the USA. So you just lost my Business after many years of using your Product, you cant even offer a discount for Customers to renew there Software Subscription each year, you have a pathetic Business Model."

An excellent and thorough step by step source to do your taxes with. It can be modified to fit your individual needs that deviate from the normal or usual straight forward income and allowable deductions. It asks all the pertinent questions so that you are able to apply that additional information to your tax return. If you have used Turbo Tax in the past, it uses that information to help you with your current tax return."
Thank you for making me tax-independent 4 years plus.
"I have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for years probably 15, so this is an adjustment for me. I changed this year as the folks
at Turbo Tax got greedy & decided to make some changes. They moved forms to the higher priced
Premier Edition that have always been on Deluxe version.
Good is keeping it short as possible, easy to understand &/or  find the answer.in a reasonable time.
 I was an accountant for years, learned ""old school"" with ledgers, typed in forms in the beginning & then  proceeded to get
 confused by computer versions!. I've seen the best & worst! This has good potential.
This passes the tests but the wording needs to be cleaned up.  Little changes-make it or break it."
"One of my favorite childhood games, just bought it because I was craving playing it and I lost my original copy somehow.

**Compatibility: Installed on my Windows 10 PC and it works perfectly. Will update when I try it on OS X El Capitan, but from what I've seen, I don't have any reason to doubt it will work."
i meet it very very well i tell other about this AMZON SOFT WARE  I HOPE OTHER GET IT TOO
"Colorful, great, great. great. Stopped using my hallmark almost completely.

So much easier and the graphics and messages are great."

"Purchasing this as a renewal of your 2015 subscription?

Hold on before you submit the code to RENEW. It does NOT extend your subscription by one year. RENEW will give you one year from the day you submit the product code. You LOSE the days remaining on your 2015 subscription.

Shame on Amazon, Norton and Symantec for continuing this deceptive practice. RENEW a subscription is commonly understood to mean extend the term of a subscription. RENEW here means LOSING the remaining days on your active subscription.

WAIT until your 2015 subscription is actually expiring before you purchase and submit the product code for renewal. That's the only way to not lose what you've paid for and get an honest renewal."
"I loaded the program into my EeePC Net Book, connected the included GPS device to a USB port, and it ran perfectly the first time.

If you have a decent laptop or Net Book this is a great buy - especially at the reduced price I paid ($37.99).  (Buy it, unless you actually need a newer map than 2009)"
I enjoy the different mosic
"It is targeted for ages 7 and up; however, my 4 1/2 year  old is not about to be left out of the fun so we let her try it.  She  typed at 3 words per minute on her first try.  We've had this computer  CD for 4 days and my 8 year old is typing at 10 words per minute.  Even  mom and dad are using it. Dad has always done hunt and peck so he's  learning the keys and I'm using it to increase my speed.

  It has lessons that won't allow you to  move on until you reach 15 wpm and 90% accuracy but you can bypass the  wpm. I don't recommend it because it will slow down your future progress.  It can be hard for a child to type the same section over and over until he reaches 15 wpm, but it is well worth the effort.  We found a way to reward our son for just sitting down to practice even if he doesn't advance to the next level.

  There are 11 games, 40 stories, 30 challenges, saved results,  etc, etc. The program story revolves around the typist being on an  island, moving from one land to another, until he finally gets to the  castle where he becomes the ruler and can defend it and play new games.

I've never come across such a thorough program. The program has won 7 awards.  Included in every  lesson are hands superimposed over a keyboard so the typist knows  where the keys are without looking down. You can look up test results  to see which hand or finger needs more practice.

This is a fun program!"
"Beware of cloud subscription. It is an annual commitment. I did not realize and I am now locked in it for a year. When I called customer support and asked them to do a 'do not renew' option, they advised that they do not have the option to do that. So, a way for Adobe to continue billing us forever.

I also mentioned them of 2 charges that appeared on my card both from Adobe, they conveniently asked me to contact my card company, without spending anytime on figuring out why they charged me twice for a given month.

Overall, a very disappointing experience from a company whose products I used to value in the past."
Top rated and reasonable
"I love the playlist and search feature. Immediate step up from Pandora, and the main reason I'm keeping the service.

However, the personalized stations, are idiots. Ex: I use a lot of massage/ relaxation.... it'll go from elegant classical piano, to jungle sounds, to deep theta sounds. Stations with consistancy would help. Another time I made a station from ""If I had a Million Dollars"" by Barenaked Ladies. I had to downvote probably 200 childrens songs. Really? I can't even follow the logic on that one..."
"I was forced to buy the new version (2015) and it's like going back to 1997, it crashes every 10 mins. I don't remember a program doing this for years, it's unbelievable!!"
"OK, draw your own conclusion."
"We tried two versions of Suse Linux and paid for support so as to minimise installation headaches. Linux in general can run very well on most PCs once it's installed and configured properly. Unfortunately Linux is a ""geeks O/S"" and as such you can't just buy a distro install it and all of the hardware drivers with a single effort and get on with life. Instead it's a PITA to track down standard hardware drivers and install them.

When we ran into a couple technical issues with Suse 9.0 their tech support basically told us they had no clue on hardware drivers and could not help us. When we inquired how they used std. hardware with this distro and what drivers they used, they could not answer. Basically Suse's tech support in our experience were clueless sales people. They were totally useless and thus we trashed both Suse Linux distros and moved on.

Won't ever get fooled by Suse again."
"This update is a really good update for Office and the price is awesome for students.  It is very similar to iworks for if you are using the mac product, you will find it easy to go back and forth.  The only real bummer about these student editions is that you have to buy a new one every update instead of buying the update.  But if they wait 4 years again, I guess it doesn't matter"
"Works pretty much as 2011. The Report function does some strange things with Actual vs. Budgets. It works, but some times, the Actuals do not show up. Like Turbotax, it takes a long time to launch."
Excellent protection so far - glad I purchased. Even seems my laptop is running faster
"This newest version doesn't seem to find your preset trans as well.  The old version would pickup using the dollar amount, this version seems to be more stuck on the wording to select traction."
Always good security
"I have been using PowerDirector 12 Ultra for a current project and at the same time using Sony Vegas Studio Platinum 12 for the same project.  I have found that PD 12 is much easier to use and understand and has more of the features that I normally use (e.g., menu, title, transitions).  It also creates DVDs/production files much faster than Sony.  Thus far, PD12 has not crashed or locked up but sometimes there is a delay until the computer catches up.  In the past I have also owned/used Adobe Premier Elements(good) and Pinnacle Studio (horrible). Most of what I do is videos of grandkids (football, soccer, baseball, etc),  Four stars instead of 5 because PD12 doesn't appear to have music files unless you purchase them separately through Smartsound."
"I tested almost any Mac screen recorder i can find.
This  one at first has pretty basic functionality but did what i need  and offer me with one of the best  performance and also was easy to use.
It gives you to select fps(up to 60) , draw selection , use present  or full screen mode recording.
Captures in h264 so sizes are not way too big and can be used right away. The system sound was recorded without issues for me.
If you want it is possible to  convert to popular devices when exporting.
I'm using on Mac mini mid2011.
Overall does what i need.
Wish they can make custom presents that can remember position and size as right now it only has fixed resolutions."
"This is something I am proud to of gotten. Heading overseas and need all the protection I can get.
This was a great choice."
"These DVDs are so impressive to me that I ordered sets for each of my daughters to have. I wish that I had something like this when I started shooting pistols many years ago!
Patricks clear descriptions and excellent camera work are combined with nice overlay graphics to aid envisioning the instructions. This makes it easy to follow along and practice the instruction steps as you watch the DVDs. The Dry Practice visuals and timeclocks were especially helpful to me as I have been going through the training drills to build it into my muscle memory.
I highly recommend this if you feel like your accuracy is not improving as much as you think it should have by now."
Great
"After doing a lot of research, I could definitely conclude that products like these, there will always be mixed reviews.  After getting some opinions from several people, I've decided to try my chances with this.  After installing it on my computer (which is a Windows 7 Home Premium) and hooking up my old VCR and camcorders, the video and sound that was displayed played just fine on my computer and I was able to record and copy my old home videos to my computer without any problem.  Even though it requires a lot of time and effort to go through the videos, and the recordings take up a lot of space on the computer, in the end it was definitely worth the trouble.  Few issues I've had was that whenever I started playing the device, the program would take a couple of seconds to finally to display the video on my computer monitor and sometimes the program slows down, but overall it wasn't a big deal.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a way to preserve Video 8, VHS, and other older video formats on their computers."
Received the package in short order and was happy with the packaging. Getting ready to install it on my server when I get the chance.
great buy
"This game is fun.  I like how you can be a hero and save the happy endings of Snow White, Peter Pan, Dumbo, and Alice.  My three favorite parts were sword fighting with Captain Hook, Saving Alice from the labyrinth, and fighting all four of the villains at once.  I also enjoyed it when Jiminy Cricket is your guide and in the end when the blue fairy tells you that you have become the greatest story book hero ever.  I was afraid that the game would not play on my computer, since it's and old game, but it played fine.  I really enjoyed this game, and loved being called the greatest story book hero ever.  Because I really enjoy reading fantasy stories, and if I got a chance to enter a fairy tale story and was asked to save the happy ending, I would do it."
Used this product before and very happy with PC protection
Great game for little guys!
"It works great and is more than I need but it's there if and when I can use it. It is HARD facing up to your bills but you have to and Quicken HELPS A GREAT DEAL for you to do it and helps you to understand what you need and how you will use it and set up your bill paying so your not surprised at anytime during the month !  Quicken helps you but doesn't make you pay bills and , in time, save something form nothing now !!!"
I had a problem with the install but other than that everything was ok.
"Don't buy this software until you have downloaded the free trial and tested its ability to connect to your bank. In my case, it could not connect to a little bank called Chase. I tried everything, including contacting Chase and paying for iBank5's Direct Connect service, but nothing worked. I wish I had tried before I buyed."
"My 10 year old loved this gift. Great product, great support when kids have a question. They get back to him promptly, we are very satisfied!"
Great buy.
"Great app, use it all the time"
"I purchased Publisher 200 Deluxe a few weeks ago after using Printshop Pro Publisher for over a year. Publisher is a big improvment for me, especially because I am so familiar with Word and Excel,and it's features are quite easy to use. I have already produced several documents, cards, newsletters etc, without any problems. I have not used Picture It that much, I prefer MGI Photosuite, which, in my opinion is superior.
My only complaint was after installing, it would not print correctly. I called Microsoft and discovered  that technical help was [expensive] a pop. I decided to reinstall it and that seems to have cured the problem (although this was time consuming).
I found inserting clip art or pictures is a breeze and selecting templates was also very easy.
I recommend this software especially for beginners or those who are moderately familiar with desktop publishing. It is easy to use and everything I have produced has impressed. I especially recommend it to users of Printshop; do yourselves a favor and upgrade to this, you won't regret it."
I could`nt get it downloaded
"I had PS CS2 and Power Director 6.0 , but with my new HD camcorder I had to change my old laptop and the softwares with it.
Thi bundle works just great. You get all the functions you need (and even more) and if you think the you get also the Nikon Efex 3.0 Filters for free you understand that the price of this bundle is riduculous."
"I don't want Amazon Music on my PC. I DON'T WANT IT. But apparently, I don't get a choice. I can't download any of the music I paid for with my actual money unless I download this program I don't want. Way to Google + it, Amazon. Apparently I can't get around downloading it, especially since I never had problems just downloading my music straight to my PC before, but since I found out about it AFTER I already purchased an album I don't really have any choice if I want to listen to it on my ipod. But be assured I'm not going to ever use it for anything that I don't absolutely have to, and since you are being such jerks about it, I'm going to make a point to downvote this crappy 'no choice' product any chance I get."
"As someone who has had good experience with NIS 2004 and 2006 over the past 3 years, I hesitated to install NIS 2007 after reading all the negative reviews posted on Amazon. Numerous reviewers who appear to be experienced computer users indicate dramatically slowed internet access and computer crashes trying to go on-line, problems in starting up, problems with running standard software, and problems with NIS installation. One reviewer, trying to counter these concerns, suggests that perhaps the problems these folks were encountering are due to not having configured the installation properly; but this raises further concerns by implying that, in 2007 (unlike prior years), some sophistication is now required during the installation process.

So it was with some trepidation that I finally gave in and bought NIS 2007. My conclusion, after a week with this new software: It's just fine. It installed easily. It has not slowed my e-mail and internet access one iota, nor has it otherwise degraded computer performance. Users with 1GB RAM probably do not need to worry about encountering problems if they install NIS 2007.

My success with this software could be due in part to the fact that I have 1GB of dual-channel RAM. (The Sept 2007 issue of Consumer Reports indicates that you probably need 1 gig of memory for use of any of the security suites on the market.) Perhaps some of the reviewers who have had bad experiences had inadequate RAM. Also, I have a Windows XP system with only standard software packages on my computer (e.g., MS Office 2003, WordPerfect Office 12, Paint Shop Pro X); perhaps some of the folks who have had problems have more esoteric web-derived software. I have Time Warner broadband internet access; I wonder if the problems may be related to the specific internet access provider, or the nature of the access (dial-up vs. DSL vs. cable).

This is not to dismiss the serious problems that some have experienced. There is clearly a finite chance that a problem can be ecountered with any security suite. (A friend bought a Dell computer with McAfee pre-installed, and her Time Warner broadband service stopped operating until McAfee was uninstalled.) I'm just suggesting that your chances of having a problem with this product are probably much smaller than the number of negative reviews here would imply, since it's the folks who have had problems who are most likely to post reviews here.

I give NIS 2007 4 rather than 5 stars because Consumer Reports (Sept 2007) rates its effectiveness the lowest of the security suites it reviewed. However, in the 3 years I've been using NIS, I have not experienced any of the threats that NIS is supposed to guard against. So either I'm lucky, or the suite is doing its job. I also grade NIS 2007 down for saying on the box that only 256MB RAM is required, when, in fact, RAM requirements may be four times that."
"On the Tivo website, this product is described as end of life.  I went to the Nero website, and the product was not found.  I am waiting for an email back from Nero support to resolve a Tivo Service Number issue, however the Nero forum reports very long response times and poor support.

The tuner seems ok, but the software has problems."
Solid hard copy of the suit. Very happy with the product and shipping time. I highly recommend getting this as a  hard media version over the download
"As a Prime Member, I had added a number of albums and songs to my library. I installed the app and ran it.
It's so counter-intuitive, it's not even funny. All I want is for it to show me my Amazon music. Instead, it shows me my mp3 files that I've copied to my external SD card. Sorry, I already have a player for those files, why would I want to use Amazon's stunted app? Recently downloaded maybe? Nope, the audiobooks from my external SD show up. WTF? All I want is to see my Amazon music through the Amazon Music app. IS THAT SO HARD?
So while Amazon Music and Prime may be awesome in concept, the execution with this app is a turdball."
Bought this earlier in the year but didn't install. Upgraded Macbook Air to OS X Yosemite Ver 10.10 and was incompatible. Was able to download a free upgrade from Symantec using their online chat. Very pleased with their customer service.
"I felt pushed to find some way to warn Mac users about the very different experience you will have with this product on your mac compared to other software you might use. This is a very, very buggy program and each update doesn't seem to make it any better. It's like software from 1992, frequent crashes and glitches. You should expect
1. Frequent crashes
2. Insertion point jumping around randomly
3. Corrections eliminating whole sentences
4. Erratic behavior between remote mic and program causing one to have to frequently restart your ios device.

If you are okay with having a program function like this, go for it because word recognition is decent. However, Nuance has no apparent problem with having their name associated with such a crappy functioning program it seems, so there is no solution in sight."
worked well
This product would not download even after and hour with Microsoft support.
"In Taxcut website customer surport page, they claim the valid range for an ITIN is ***-70_*** to ***-80-***. However, the IRS website publishes the range as ***-70-*** to ***-88-***. This out-of-date info in Taxcut software is preventing people (with ITIN range between ***-81-*** and ***-88-***) from e-filing the tax returns. I called Taxcut twice, and pointed out this problem, but the support people were either too ignorant of the ITIN number and software update routines, or just gave me some wierd unhelpful solutions, such as delete the number, close the software, wait for 5 minutes, then try again. I am having little hope that Taxcut will fix this problem this year, and I can only do a paper-filing now even though I paid for the version with e-file included. Also, thinking of all the trouble I have to go through to get a refund, I don't even want to bother."
"I had a lot of problems installing this software into my computer. My computer froze once, then the second time I tried it didn't install correctly. I was never able to actually install this product.

What I can say about this product is that I do like that you can install it in however many computers you want."
I've always used Family Tree Maker software for my genealogy research. But I read the reviews on RootsMajic 6 and saw several demos of it by a friend of mine so I decided to make the change. It has been a challenge in the sense that I have to learn the location of where to enter information. (Old habits die slowly.)The great thing about this software is how easy it was to move my FTM info to RootsMajic and it didn't change a thing. Also it has a timeline that once you have entered your information you can see movement of your ancestors through time. Another great part of it is that you can go to online websites without leaving your work.  I would recommend that you buy the book that goes along with RootsMajic 6.
Not worth it
"I have been recording with a stand alone workstation since 200. I just got the Sonar x1 software for my PC and is very impressed with it performance. It is a real step up for me. The convenirnce, the ease and simplicity of carrying out the different recording and editing task is amazing. What took me so long? I really do love working with the with the Sonar x1. I am a mucian and is presently working with it on my new recording. Its turning out to be a wonderful experience."
This product does not do stock and bond sales without a $70 upgrade. Last year's product did.
"Being a novice at quicken, I'll need time to try out the available options. I am currently utilizing the banking option for tax time. Give me time. Thanks"
"Code does NOT work! ""Our system is experiencing difficulty processing your card. Please try this process again."" and again, and again, and again...............NG."
Complete and up to date maps worked perfectly in our Nuvi. We even were able to easily find alternative routes when the curves got too crazy.
I LOVE Amazon Music!
"After spending hours to download a 40 MB file from Amazon's servers and installing it, the application is in a perpetually state of updating. The application window states ""Updating Your Amazon Music app"" with a spinning circle that will eventually stop as the application just sits there. It doesn't crash, but it doesn't do anything either. There is no information on where to get technical support."
"Microsoft Office Small Business 2007 Upgrade was the perfect solution for me.  It installed easily, works perfectly, and is easy to use.  It has the programs I want: Excel, Publisher, Outlook, Word and Powerpoint.  It also comes with Tools like Picture Manager, Clip Organizer, Language Settings, Diagnostics and Digital Certificates.  It upgraded seamlessly from my 2002 package."
"Takes a little bit to get used to the ""ribbon"" toolbars. Helpful in writing papers. Lots of good features for all. Note: If you are going to send documents to others, most don't have this version or higher, so remember to click the ""save as"" button and the more common older edition years button for Word 97-2003, so that they don't have compatability problems."
Great product and buying it off Amazon was so quick and easy. I paid for it and instantly downloaded it onto my computer.
"I have used Quicken For Years, decided to update to this year's version."
All my tax requirements and my family are met - used for years.
Wish I could down load the songs but they play perfectly from the Amazon Cloud.  One less device to carry.
"This product lets you enhance photos you've taken by creating painter-type special effects on the photos.  Nothing else.  If that's what you want to do, the product is excellent.  But don't buy this as an alternative to Photoshop or PhotoImpact, or other picture-editing software.  Speaking of which, you can produce many of these same effects if you own Photoshop, but it is much, much, easier with this program.  And this is a lot cheaper than the full version of PhotoShop.
Installation is easy, the program includes enough tutorials to get you well-started, which is good, as I think those not used to graphics editing programs will need the nudge to get started.  It is reasonably easy to use when you get past the initial hump.  The program is much easier to use with a graphics pad such as the Wacom tablets than a mouse, and highly recommend getting a tablet if you intend to use this a lot."
This actually works on Windows Vista and Windows 7.  The kids loved these video games as young children and they still love them now years later!  Thanks so much.
Everything as advertised. Arrive don time.
Using at my laptop.
Do not waste your hard-earned money on this product. I'd heard it was buggy and slow but in my case I couldn't even get it to load on my TiBook 667 running OSX 10.3.6. multiple emails to the company have been ignored and phone calls are impossible since they are in the Netherlands and list only a fax number. Looks like I'll have to keep using Street Atlas in classic mode.
"I needed it to unlock a laptop that was giving me issues, well worth the purchase, saved me allot of time and money."
Works as expected.
"Long known for their innovative and stable products Autodesk has again hit upon a great package aimed at the smaller or start-up firms out there with their Autodesk AutoCAD Revit LT Suite 2013. Please note that this package (single seat) and its functionality is not meant for large(r) firms nor firms already fully in the BIM world.

That said this package is excellent for the small office user or ones that are considering transitioning to BIM (Building Information Modeling).

The suite offers both the 3D BIM tools as well as drafting and more 'traditional' tools of AutoCAD LT software (LT being the 'lite' version of AutoCAD offerings). Having BOTH means that you can continue your production work in LT while transitioning to BIM in Revit LT. well thought out Autodesk!

Autodesk Revit LT assists you in creating extremely high quality/accurate designs, documents, etc. all within a coordinated 3D environment. Need to make a change or revision? No problem! All changes are automatically updated throughout the model meaning less work and less mistakes!

Key features of Autodesk Revit LT and/or AutoCAD LT 2013 Suite include:

DOCUMENTATION:
Create documentation with 2D drafting and detailing tools
Full annotations
Automate the creation of schedules based on building components
Automatically calculate and track material quantities in cost estimates
Automatically update all documentation view when revisions are made

3D MODELING:
Use specialized architectural modeling tools for BIM to concurrently design and document

VISUALIZATION AND PRESENTATION:
Easily generate 3D orthographic or perspective views from any angle
Produce compelling, photorealistic renderings with Autodesk 360 rendering
Create real-time animations/walkthroughs to visualize the building virtually

COLLABORATION:
Design, document, and share files in the DWG format
Reference other file formats, including DFW, etc.
Exchange Revit files with stakeholders using Autodesk Revit

Net sum: This is a great 2-in-1 package for close to or maybe even less than a single seat of AutoCAD. Wonderful for a small firm wishing to make a big impact. Not overly heavy on laptop computer while other items are open (e.g. Outlook, browser, iTunes)."
"This version of QuickBooks has a great interface, does what it is represented to do, and is easy for users to navigate. I  have recommended this version to all of my clients."
could do some of the thing I need for my business plan.
Upgrated from Windows 7 to 10 due to necessity.  Flawless installation. Not one issue.  Highly recommended.
"This is a unique little device which has given me visibility into stuff that I really don't know how to look at otherwise. I spend much of my time hardening my infrastructure against failure, the whole enterprise mantra of no single point of failure etc etc. The problem is that networks have this really unique feature that they can be 'kinda' failed, which is to say that stuff kinda works and packets are kinda getting through and all the links are up and yet the network is *borked*.

The requirement of any good operations team is to be able to identify the problems and hunt them down and fix them quickly. But there is a chicken and egg problem, until you have them you can't hunt them, and hunting one down doesn't give you any confidence at all that you can find the others. In steps this product, something to screw up your network, but in a programmatic way, now you can cause problems and see how those kinds of issues manifest in your overall infrastructure.

The huge benefit here is you can ask questions like ""What does it look like if one of my two aggregated link starts dropping packets?"", ""How does jitter issues manifest in the VOIP network?"", ""Packet loss on the LAN vs packet loss on the WAN?"", the list goes on and on.

Selective impairment of the network uncovers where your algorithms, measuring, and responses are weak. This product gives you a tool for creating problems in a controlled way so that your team can learn what symptoms appear when different problems are present. This gives them a faster response time to the root cause, your total availability goes up, and everyone is happy."
"I used TurboTax in 2006 for the first time with no complaints. Then again, my return was pretty simple. I basically bought it because I am no good with numbers and felt safer having a double check for myself.

This year I purchased again and it was horrible! My return was more complex, having purchased a home and having multiple work deductions. All said and done, TurboTax told me I owed about $1100! After a moment of panic, I called a lifelong CPA who was a friend of a friend and took the same documents in to him. Looking over TurboTax's work he was amazed. He told me it was all wrong. Numbers were in some forms and not others, the wrong forms had been used, and some things I could have deducted weren't there at all because TurboTax's ""Deduction Maximizer"" didn't tell me I could.

All said and done, we saved over $500 by his redoing our taxes and got tips on getting more back next year. Plus he E-filed for free. TurboTax charges you $18 for that.

In addition, their customer service stinks. I have a hard time finding someone to speak English and when I asked about the ""Satisfaction Guarenteed"" refund he started asking for my private information to ""pull my record."""
"Kudos to Fluenz for moving away from the machine-like instruction style of most computer education programs!  I would have been way to intimidated to even let myself get into the learning without Sonia, the friendly on-screen tutor who is there to actually teach Chinese, rather than just let you absorb it.  I have a Motorola Q phone and the Fluenz Mobile program works great on it. The videos are smooth and more importantly, Sonia is still there to give instruction.  They really did a great job with this program."
"Well, it's Amazon. What else would you expect?"
Did not work with my windows as expected. Not 32 bit or 64 bit.
"I certainly like to give rave reviews to all products I purchase.  It makes me feel I did my homework before I made the buy. It also makes me feel that it was hard earned money well spent.  I can't say that about my recent purchase of Trend Micro's Titanium Internet Security. I have a laptop that I bought a few months ago.  It is still very quick to bring up any program, but...GOOD LORD!!  After installing this, I couldn't bring up any program(e-mail,internet browser,my favorite cribbage game), for a good 7-8 minutes after turning the laptop on. There was just no response by any program. I uninstalled it less than a week after it was installed. I have a different anti-virus running now.  Everything is back to normal. I WILL NOT recommend this to anyone."
Fort me through my trip to Italy this summer. Great fort cities and highways but in the small towns it sometimes tells you to go down a road that you question if it's a road or a dirt path.
"The Rip works good, have not tried the Burn."
"WP X8 has certain advantages over X3 which I also use. One can translate files to docx for use in MD Word, for example. Printing to PDT is easier. A major flaw is that 'document compare' is deleted from the 'home & student' X8 version. Since I have X3, I can use X8 to create files to be translated (as needed) to *.docx, and X3 to compare documents, but this is sub-optimal. WP is still better than Word because the reveal codes is still there. With Word, one never knows how to deal with formatting problems. But WP leaves some critical features out of the H&S version. Support via chat is marginal. So best to have 2 versions going. Not ideal but there it is."
Needs updating
"It's quicken software, what is there to say? No big deal, nothing that new, overpriced and railroaded into purchasing it. Not crazy about quicken products but it is what I have been using for well over a decade so I stay with it.  Most annoying is it went on sale just days after I received my purchase and I would have saved an additional $15."
"Fast an accurate, will use again."
"I thought I was receiving one program. I received a package or suite with the product I wanted and they all work great. I can say I received multiple bonuses. The company responds to every inquiry with friendliness and professionalism. I wrote with a jaded, crummy and distrustful attitude, thinking maybe its an impostor selling copies, used, without serials.. The responses where helpful, speedy and 100% accurate. The goods arrived on time and in mint condition. Activation was child's play and takes two seconds. I am completely satisfied and even rethinking my attitude towards people and life."
Was just what i needed I had a copy of Win 7 home premium and just needed a Product key. I got it in and entered the key in and i got verified/activated and now i am good to go. Side note if anything happens to motherboard down road i will have to rebuy the product but i am ok with that
I seemed to have found this when it was a bargain at 19.99. Usually it much higher. I went back later and it was 59.99. This is one of those gems you stumble upon at Amazon.
"This was the first real computer game we got for my granddaughter. She loved it and would play for hours if we let her; heck, Nana and Papa played it too! Then we went on to Putt Putt,  Freddie Fish, Spy Fox and P J Sam. The were glitch -free, affordable and fun for kids even in their teens. Wish I had kept them now that she has a little girl. I still think they are the best series of games for kids with the most interesting characters. Shoot, I'd like to have 2 or 3 Spy Fox games  for myself !"
"I am sure it is more efficient for programs, I am sure if this was a tablet and had a touch screen it might be workable, but I hate the user interface. I spend so much time trying to get to things and always have to go to the internet for instructions.  It took adding 'Classic Shell' off the internet to keep me from re-installing an older version of Windows and I only execute things from desktop to avoid being trapped in the user interface."
".. when I went to run the program (geared to 3-5 year olds, btw ... ), I signed myself in and hit the ""go"" button .. crash!  .. I  recovered, and made sure my graphics settings were dummied down to suit the  program (256 colors at super vga) and tried again .. fatal errors, page  fault, screen freeze .. after several more attempts including uninstalls  and reistalls, I attempted to call Microsoft support with absolutely no  luck .. I gave up after 20' of waiting after calling a non-toll free  number... I figured I'd try Microsoft support on the internet .. I did find  a possible solution in their ""popular questions"" section .. lots  of ""popular questions"", btw, regarding system crashes re. this  little gem of a software btw ... they suggest an incompatability between  the display adaptor and the software; fix is to reduce the graphic  acceleration to one notch above ""nothing"" .. and then they have  the nerve to suggest contacting your hardware manufacture for updated  drivers ... like there is nothing wrong with the software?  fwiw, my  compute was ""state of the art"" just 8 months ago and I keep all  my drivers up to date .. pass that buck!  After trying to figure out how  to get any kind of Customer/Technical support at the M'Soft website, I  finally firured out that I was in a Catch-22 situation .. to specify this  software for Incident Reporting, I need a product ID, and per info on the  website, the way to obtain the product ID is to have the software running,  access the ""Progress Report"" module, and then choose help/about  ... since my problem is that the software won't even run after the sign-on  screen, I couldn't get into the support system.
Not being the type to  give up easily, I entered the support system by specifying my buggy  software as Win95 (Product ID readily available), and in the incident  report box, explained my problem and asked that someone please forward my  problem to the appropriate section .. just got a report back saying my  ""free customer support period had expired"" and my incident was  rejected .. aaaagggghhhhhhh!  .. to make matters worse, I cut up the box"
"If you do DVD's or make slide shows of your photos, you will find that the best and easiest program BY FAR is VideoShow Expressions by Individual Software. I have used WonderShare, Roxio, AShampoo, and a few others. VideoShow Expressions is the easiest to use and understand; it is the most versatile of all the programs on the market. They also have SlideShow Expressions which is good, but it is not as strong a program as VideoShow.

I have noodles for brains when it comes to doing things on the computer, but I have to say that this program is almost effortless to learn and use. One of the reasons that this program outshines the others is because of the simplicity of the pan & zoom feature. You can decide what angle the picture comes in and zoom in and out, rotate, go back out, and how long it sits there if at all. When you add your music you can decide how many seconds each picture will be and loop the music or you can have the photos timed to the length of your music.

You do not have to use the irritating film graphs that the other programs have, they have simplified this program so a six-year-old can figure it out. My recommendation for picture times is 11 to 12 seconds per picture and adjusting your music and or pictures so it comes out in the end to that. Sounds confusing, but it is much easier to do than it sounds. Any less than 10 seconds a photo, the pictures move too fast and any longer than 14 seconds a photo becomes boring.

I may do things a bit differently than most, but all my photos are kept in dated files on my computer (which are backed up on disks and external drives). They are all sized to 3"" at the largest edge and 150 or 200 ppi, this way you can enlarge or reduce them at any time with no damage to the photo and without using too much space on your hard drive. I use Micrografx Picture Publisher for all photos - again easiest program to work (although I do use PhotoShop when I want to ""fake"" pictures). When I want to make a video I make a new file copy and paste all the pictures I want to use in it, and then I arrange them in the order I want them. Once they are in order I rename each of them to a number in the order of use, My original pictures are still in their original files with their original names.

When I open my VideoShow Expressions and get to the part that says ""add photos"" I can go to that file and select the photos which just load in the order I want them. Should I decide I want to move them around... dragand drop is king! Then you can take the photos that you want to add text to - write, size & pick color, and then drag the text to the correct spot on the photo. Next take each photo and decide what pan & zoom you will use - they can all be different - and the percent that the photo stops at the beginning or the end of the transition. I generally just do a 20% stand still after the transition. The exciting part of this is that the program also has video transitions, so picking random transitions along with the pan and zoom makes your video come alive. Most programs have the transitions, but not the pan and zoom feature.

Once you are satisfied with how each photo looks, click next and pick your songs (which are already suppose to be on your computer). Say you have 220 photos and they are going to each go about 12 seconds. You are looking at songs that will add up to about 2,640 seconds (or about 44 minutes worth of music). Check the box that says fit photos to the music length. Do a preview and after you catch your breath at the thrill of it all, you can SAVE & CLOSE. Then when you open it up again you can pick your theme and title, save, and then you can write to disk. You need a DVD writer and you want to choose (TV and/or the NTSC setting), best fit and usually the 4 mbits per second and variable rate. My computer is very particular and for awhile would not accept certain selections, but after trial and error, those are the settings that seem to work best.

When it has finished writing it will ask if you want to do another - don't because it is a long process (up to six hours if your computer is slow). You are better off to save your first disk (mark it as original) and then use your copy disk feature to make as many copies as you want. This program also has a feature to make CD or DVD labels; you can make fancy labels from the templates and add your own writing and pictures.

If this isn't enough, the program also allows you to make DVDs from your video camera and even combine photos and videos with seamless transitions on the same DVD. I have not done this yet, but this program is a must to have if you want to make DVDs of your pictures or videos."
Always use Norton.
"Office v. X is a solid upgrade of the venerable suite from Microsoft. It looks great in Mac OS X, and more importantly WORKS great. I spend a great deal of time using Entourage, Word, and Excel -- the more I do, the more I find to like.
I get 400+ emails per day, and the extensive rules support, linking of messages to contacts, and linking between all aspects of Entourage to be a huge help in staying organized.
I was a *long* time user of Eudora, and missed it at first, but appreciate the benefits Entourage brings.
The other parts of Office are hugely powerful too, but by now, you probably know you need it anyway!"
"The poor rating is due to sending of a product previously known to be defective.  Norton deserves a five-star as I have been repeatedly using their products since 1996.

This was just a product key but the product key was defective.  My first attempt to have this corrected returned the Indian sub-continent response to follow the instructions on the back of the card with the product key which obviously did not work or I otherwise would not have had to contact them concerning the defective product key.  I had even explained the additional steps and troubleshooting to confirm that the issue was with an invalid product key but apparently she lacked either the English skills or technical knowledge to understand the issue.

The next day I used the option to have someone call me.  This person admitted that they had problems with a series of product keys and would send one to me without having to go the return route.  He stated that he had tried same-day delivery but that it was too late in the day so it was sent next-day delivery.  It was sent next-day but USPS meaning that if and when they get around to it the product will appear in the mailbox, which it did late in the afternoon.

Bottom line is that I was unable to use the product for nearly two days while waiting for a valid product key to arrive and my request to have a product key emailed instead was not answered.

Product:

I have never had a problem with Norton slowing down any system that I have owned and this is no exception even when being used on an eight-year old computer.  The only slowdowns ever experienced are when I  run scans without having the option set to run in background although I admit to not even looked for this setting in the current version."

"Quicken Home and Business 2014 seems to work as well as the 2012 version, and it has the same problem: When I customize the Toolbar to add the Mileage Tracker icon, close down and reopen Quicken 2014, the added Mileage Tracker has disappeared. This is the same problem that has been repeatedly reported by many users for 2012, 2013 and now 2014. It is as if Quicken programmers don't want to accept feedback from customers to improve the functionality of their product. Also, after I upgraded to Quicken 2014, my automatic bank download feature will not download. I'll figure it out as I have a degree in Computer Science, but it seems so frustrating to upgrade (at a cost) and then have to reprogram myself."

"I was moving to Japan and wanted to learn Japanese.  Not phrases or single words, but actually learn Japanese - the sentence structures, the proper pronunciation...all that fun stuff.  I shouldn't have expected to get this from a cd."
"Movie was as corny as the series but I think that is what they were going for. I enjoyed the movie, not Will Ferrell's best but still entertaining"
"I was concern about downloading this product with all the negatives reviews. I was using TurboTax software for over 15 years.
This year I decided to safe time and purchase downloaded version of the software.
In my case, download and installation on Mac with El Capitan 10.11.3 went through just fine. There were no single glitch to report.
After installation, I also downloaded updates and a state information. I was happy that there were no problem experienced during that step either.
And finally, I was able to complete my taxes with no single bug to report. I am extremely happy with the product and simplicity of the process. I am highly recommending this product."
As i get older and find it somewhat difficult to use complicated programs I decided to abandon Photoshop c6s for something i hoped would be simpler. Ha. This is just as complicated and offers less although there is a huge difference in price. Any comments or tips would be appreciated. thanks
"very satisfied with the product, price, service and timing"
great download!!!!!
I used this software to make a simple will for myself. There are many options for adding details to legal documents depending on each individual's circumstance. I'm very pleased overall and would purchase this again. My one complaint --they need to make it for Mac as well!
Full featured Tax Software and an excellent price. I have used H&R Block software before so new it would work for me. Getting the download version worked well for me and saved shipping cost.
Great product from a trusted company. Easy to set up. Great price here on Amazon!
I wanna say that I am very happy with this product that I bought. It was just what I expected and it arrived on time.
Great
"Install went great.  No issues other than losing some passwords, which I expected.  Other than that if you are looking to upgrade and have some PC knowledge this is a great way to save $$$."
"it found issues that Kaspersky did not find, so I am much happier with this product"
Best out there
It would not download on my laptop.  Do not think it was a problem with the disk.  Just too old an application.
"I've used QB for business for five years and moved to the Online version six months ago. It is a real time saver.
 I've been able to make updates at home with details that can too easily be forgotten during a hectic day in the office or finish up routine reconciliations at home so I can beat the ATL traffic!
I've always enjoyed the facility of the Reports in QB. A bonus is that my boss can run her own reports now now that she and I both have ready access. Our offsite CPA can retrieve quarterly payroll numbers as well.
I also appreciate the quick response that Intuit has made when there have been issues. Some of the verbiage on invoices was not flush with the text box but was readily addressed.
My only wish now is that I could store more than one template for invoicing as we have two divisions with two distinct names/branding, and I have to switch back and forth between the two. Once that's fixed I'll be completely delighted!"
"This program is the second one I've bought since I just bought a new Mac computer. It works pretty well, but  be sure to check the little words like is and as, etc. It gets better as it learn how you speck."
"I have never had a virus program that has to up date every day. Would prefer to back up to disk, not on line. What good does an on-line back up do when you can't connect to the internet? Never again."
"I bought this as a gift, after I through out some hints because I though it would be pretty interesting to trace and document my family history.  The product itself is good and have used it for several years and done several upgrades and this was the only time I had an a problem is when I lost some data.  I think maybe I accidentally save under more than one name, then later mapped over the other copy so totally a user error. I would recommend it highly. I had no problems upgrading from my previous version of Family Tree Maker but before you start an upgrade process, backup your database."
"Crossdown is the product to buy if you are serious about making authentic crossword puzzles and have the skills and desire needed for truly original creations. It is used by professionals the world over which gives you some idea of its capabilities. If you are looking for a quick utility that will build a simple word web from a predefined list of a dozen words or so -- and there are uses for these kinds of designs -- look elsewhere. Although Crossdown can import word webs from other sources to take advantage of Crossdown's impressive toolbox. With Crossdown you can export crossword puzzles in a variety of graphic formats, deploy interactive puzzles to websites, even generate single-puzzle games that can be run on other computers."

"A little over a month ago, as careful as I usually am, I misclicked somewhere and a trojan keylogger was able to find it's way into my computer.  I had just downloaded the newest Norton internet security and after the keylogger had begun it's damage I ran several scans, but Norton couldn't find it.  My options were: reformat, pay Norton $100.00 to scan my system remotely from their tech. support, or try another anti-virus.  I picked up Kaspersky and followed the install directions (had a bit of a hangup with uninstalling AVG, just need to check with the troubleshooting feature Kaspersky provides).  Kaspersky found the trojan in 4 minutes and deleted all versions of it from my computer.  I have not had any trouble, and my computer loads faster since installing Kaspersky."
"Yes, this was the easiest of database programs for names and addresses. You can use Microsoft Word and Lotus Word Pro for mailmerges, but you probably need to use a spreadsheet program at the same time."
Price was right. Sure it will work when I switch to E-books
Did what i needed so easy!!
"We have been useing QuickBooks for the last 10 years for our small business. The new QuickBooks Pro 2006 is a great inprovement, very easy to use and I would recommend it to anyone in business, big or small."

"I just got the automatic upgrade.  THE PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE A CLOSE FEATURE!!!  That's right, once it's running on your computer, you cannot close it.

I feel like I just downloaded a piece of malicious software!  Read on for more complaints..."
"While it works for some very simple documents, it is inaccurate with most others.

""B"" is OCR as ""8"" or vice-versa and others errors you'd not expect from a 2014 OCR app.
Sometimes the numbers are read with errors and on other occasions it will just disregard words or numbers completely.

I understand an app may have issues but after numerous emails exchanged with their tech reps - I have asked for a refund.
A refund was practically part of the warranty promised and it was well within the limits of the first 30 days.
I have received nothing as a refund and I am stuck with a useless piece of software.
Buyers beware !!!"
"This is a great piece of software for the money and it is easy to take one of your ""out dated"" computers and convert it to a Windows Home Server.  The only issue you will need to be aware of is that it doesn't always load the latest drivers (or in my case couldn't find it) so I had to find and load the driver myself.  Highly recommended for the price"
"Using with my Grade 1 and 3 children .... (and I'm doing it alongside them).  'lessons' vary in length from 5 minutes to 30 minutes and I do find that the words 'stick' better through this immersion technique rather than translating.  Children can use the programme with ease (although please don't mistake that as it being easy, definitely pushes them to think!) ... they can keep on trying the lessons until they grasp it .. so far they've been getting 100% before moving on to the next lesson, I'm not that much of a perfectionist so they are definitely 'beating' me in the scoring!!  Covers reading, writing, pronunciation, grammar .... well rounded."
"Adobe Photoshop Elements is a fun platform for digital scrapbooking and art journaling digitally.  I downloaded this particular software onto my computer with Windows 10 and it works fairly well. I do have an older computer (about 4 years old) and it tends to run a bit slow with PE and I occasionally have to shut down the program and restart it. Overall, though, I've been very happy with the software and downloading was a handy and quick way to get the software. At $79, it is a very affordable option, a one-time fee as opposed to a subscription like so many companies are doing with their software these days.  I purchased this to use for digital Bible journaling and for digital scrapbooking. I love being able to do these projects without needing to purchase physical elements that can only be used once or twice and then need to be replaced. Digital elements and papers can be saved on your computer and used over and over again. The only storage space you need is your computer--no shelves full of stuff!"
"Before buying this I was 100% 'Newbie'...as in never used video editing software previously. I will say that so far it's proven to be a pretty intuitive interface, and just scrolling the mouse over all the features helps tremendously. If you're not getting what you want, I would recommend getting on youtube and watching a few tutorials. I've not had even one ""crash"", no lost data or anything destructive yet(fingers crossed). It's been super easy just doin' the drag and drop...music...pics....videos....text...whatev'...just slap 'em all together on the time line and viola!"
"I have been using the Tax Cut (previous incarnation of this product) for the last three years, and previously used the Turbo Tax product.  This product is definitely less expensive than TuboTax, and offers the backing of a big name in the tax game to boot.  The program allows you to import information from previous years, saving you the hassle of having to re-enter information.  My tax returns are a bit more involved than the average person, as I have stock transactions, rental properties, and other non-standard deductions and expenses.  This product makes it as easy as working through a ""wizard"" which asks the right questions to get the right numbers into your return.  I highly recommend it."
"The one star is for Kaspersky's persistent inability to remove ""Trojan. NSIS.StartPage.fo"", despite having made close to a dozen attempts.
This malware bug is ""LAUGHING"" at Kaspersky.  This will be my last license renewal!

"I'm no techie and I don't do much more than word processing, internet, email, photos and music, but I can say that there is a noticeable increase in speed in a variety of contexts.  It's as if you upgraded your processor and memory for just $25.  I had no problems with installation, printing, time machine, or the few non-Apple applications I have.

You won't notice any significant new features if you already use Safari 4.0, but the added snappiness alone makes Snow Leopard a bargain."
"A very easy, and self paced way of learning about the ins and outs of Office 2016 and Windows Once it is loaded properly using Amazon Games and Software Downloader, the program easily loads and provides you with a great variety of programs to learn, including Word 2016, Excel 2016, PowerPoint 2016, Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Outlook 2016, Access 2016, OneNote 2016, Windows 7, and Internet Explorer.  For a very reasonable price, you will become and expert on the use of Office 2016 and Windows.  The programs lead you through the entire program on a step by step basis so you can learn a little every day and then pick up the next day to learn even more.  I highly recommend this product for those who are seeking to upgrade their Office and Windows knowledge or those who have never used these Office 2016 and/or Windows to get the most of these programs."
I have to use this program because the rest of the world uses it. I would rather use WordPerfect. Word is unweildy and not as easy to use as my processor of choice.
"My federal and state taxes were difficult due to the fact that I retired in 2013 and had income from my employer, social security and my state pension. Turbo Tax asked me a few questions and as a result I had my federal and state taxes completed in a few hours.  Turbo Tax allowed me to file electronically and my refunds were deposited in my bank account within four weeks."
Love this better than iTunes or Media Player.  All my music organized in one easy to use place and the relief of having my music secure on the cloud.
I have been using this for years and it still seems to work fine. Actually it is working better as it is catching some of the duplications on the Quicken downloads better. I still think it costs too much but I know of none better.
This is one of the best utilities I have used to keep track of my finances. The add features for tracking investments and debt reducer are wonderful additions.
Region locked to U.S. and Canada. Does not work in Australia. SMALL PRINT ON BACK PAGE IS NOT ON ANY OF THE INFORMATION FROM AMAZON PICTURES AND DETAILS (See bottom left corner of images attached). Why supply it!!
quickbooks has made the complicated process of starting a business an easy and exciting experience. Thank you.
Excellent price. I paid $80 for this two years ago. It is original product and just upgrade my existing account on Mcafee.
"This program won't work with Windows XP!!!
It is a good simple progrram if you are still using 98se.
I'm disappointed that it dosen't work."
"I purchased this item on February 17, 2011, and it is not the version I need. I need a newer version, but can not find it anywhere. Can anyone please help me ?!?"
"As a published author in the traditional sense I had many books that were 200 pages long.  This required a lot of formatting to get it right in kindle.  I began using this software a few years back, there were some kinks in the original versions, but Nitin was always determined he would create a product that was outstanding.  He has now achieved that, and it takes full sized books with no issues.  It is an easy step process and you can include your graphics in easily as well.  No mean feat in Kindle.

This software is my secret weapon :) for formatting professional books in Kindle.  I haven't had time to try it on other formats"
"I have had this program for years. You have to use the Disk to access the clip art. Somehow the disk became broken, I mean really broken with a chunk taken out, no one will confess to breaking it.

I reordered a program as I found I couldn't do without it. It's simple and easy to use. The book that comes with it lets you browse through the clip art quickly and find what you need. This clip are will work with most any program I have. It's simple little clip art but that's what I need 99% of the time and there's lots of it. I highly recommend it."
I suppose this would be a great product if I knew more.  Made for the more experienced web builder.
"NO, I have yet to get my downloads to work!!!  Have used Ouicken since the 1990s this is horrid."
PERFECT!
"Works as expected. Kindle beats the daylights out of Nook which has abandoned an ""for PC"" aps. Help put not and Barnes and Noble out of business by downloading this free ap and ebooks at reasonable Amazon prices... AND, once purchased... unlike Nook you can move the the books around between as many as SIX that 6 different devices. Kindle is the way to go."
As this is the first personal financial organizer i have used but being fluent in software data applications I do not find it necessarily very obvious in what to do to set up billing.  Ad hoc bills in particular are difficult to work with.
"Because I am just starting to learn Italian, I did not find the Rosetta Stone very helpful due to the fact that there was no English translation whatsoever.  Although pictures were shown, I was not certain that I was getting the correct meaning of what was being said.  As for me, I prefer the classroom setting with a professor to learn and get some personal feedback on my progression.  Maybe if I was further along in the language, the Rosetta Stone would be helpful, but at this point I did not think it was a beneficial tool."

  I upgraded to this software. Previous versions were working OK. This is a disaster. It crashes every few minutes. It won't uninstall & trying to remove it is very difficult. It's like crab grass on you computer. Unless Nuance overhauls this product & sends previous users a free replacement I will never purchase from them again."
"Purchased this product for the trails that are supposed to be included.  We were to hike in the Ramapo Mountain Forest in northern New Jersey.  None of the trails in the area are included in TOPO 2008.  Buy the trail maps from the New York New Jersey Trail Committee.  I wonder how many other trails are missing.  Anyway the missing trails are published trails, so I thought they should be included."
"What do you need of a Operating System? anything you mention is on this software or can be accomplished by it. OS/2 is a great set of tools that can be expandible with suites like star office or Lotus Smart Suite, and you can use OS features like voice recognition and other things that not even Windows XP has on it."
Works perfectly.
I prefer the older version and it's applications.... Not too crazy about this version..... Maybe after I get used to it I will like it better
It cannot be used normally because it is a edition being limited!
"Anytime that you can get an ""Unlimited number of installations for less than half what it costs for 3 licenses, you'd be crazy to pass it up.  The only negative was uninstalling the 3 license previous version (that I typically renewed at full price) then downloading and installing the new unlimited license version from McAfee (Intel Security). - they were helpful too."
"Amazon.com is amazing I received the product as it is told, every thing is good so far.
I am very satisfied"
"Purchased Quicken Deluxe 2010 for $45.  Two days later I get an email 50% off Deluxe for 29.99.  I contacted Quicken and they said I would need to return it to Amazon and then purchase it from them to get the discount.  When I said I would rather just return 2010 and stick with my older 2008 version they didn't seem to care.  Guy named Wasif said ""You can also do so"".  Whatever that means.  Therefore, after reading all the reviews about 2010 not being much different I am going to return this and stay with 2008.  However, lately my 2008 has been having Quicken server problems when downloading my bank info.  As well as now I have data corruption errors when importing from my bank.  For several years I never had an issue until I go 2 years beyond an upgrade.  Hmmm makes it seem kinda fishy how older versions seem to mysteriously have issues.  Guess that is one way to get people to want to upgrade.  Back to manual entrie and reconcile for now."
This is the kind AV software you need. Fast and unobtrusive so you don't know it's there unless you need it. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for AntiVirus software
Everything is fine
"Corel Fusion ... I bought it as an early release last year, and today, Corel still sells only version 1.0.0.  No updates are available.  Will they ever?  Does it need updates?  My answer is most certainly, but until then, it has its useful side.

What I use it for:
...1.  Expanding or combining documents -- not just pdfs, but office suite products such as from Microsoft or a version of Open Office - it claims over 100 supported filetypes.  It probably does, but maybe it will not support all the features of each orginally created product.  Examples under Cautions, below.  Don't assume they are comprehensive.
...2.  Rearranging PDFs -- for instance -- I put together several documents to be sent as a single fax while retaining a digital copy.  When I have several audiences, its easy in assembly mode to rearrange pages for different emphasis, delete unneeded pages, add new ones in a single package, regardless of original and mixed formats that may be present.

What I wish I could do:
...1. Add password / encryption.
...2. Edit documents directly: (its possible to make simple substitutions, such as correct spelling from ""to"" to ""two"" for example, but) its not possible to replace sentences across multiple lines in one simple step.

Cautions:
  If you have a PDF form which allows you to save data in fields, and you have done so with another product, DON'T use that file with Fusion.  When I save such a file with this product, the field data is omitted and deleted (even from view in real-time)!

  If you embed graphics in a Word type document, keep a backup.  This product may mis-render some of the colors.

  The document has not printed all my PDFs clearly.  For instance, I had a form with 3% of the text oriented vertically along an edge; and I've had otherwise normal text with phrases bolded.  In both cases part of the text on those lines printed too faint to read.  They printed fine, in the main competitor's product.

Quirky Registration: Watch your order fulfillment documentation carefully -- look for a serial number in the format of XXXX-XXXX- etc.  Entering it into the program will take you out of trial mode.  The quirky part is if you try to register via the website, it will hand you a confirmation code not at all like the SN and doesn't work for the program's activation prompt.

Shame on the manufacturer for making zero fixes since April 2011.  Other reasons for downgrading it are (1) sometimes possible to lose content or (2) have graphics altered.  For simple text documents it works fine, but if you  create tables, insert graphics, use outlines, change fonts or styles, test out the trial version thoroughtly before making a decision."
"The product includes Norton Antivirus and securities... MANY SELLERS here is not complying with AMAZON product, they are selling the ""BASIC"" edition which does not have a Norton Antivirus.  ""BE CAREFUL"" as I wss sold the wrong version, now I am fight to get my full money out.
Amazon customer service is in India, and even when I filed a report, they had not fix the AD site!  The outsource are so stupid, and did not answer my issue or when I forward a report! Their services hade went down!
Don't take this as an offense, I do love Amazon, just have to be careful now!"
"downloaded from amazon.com.  Now I can open word and excel docs on my mac.  The interface is a little clunky compared to a  windows machine, but so far everything works great."
"I picked this up for my granddaughter's computer class.  It's basic and it's simple, something she needs as a 7th grader who is interested in creating her own animation.  One reviewer gave this is a one star because of its limitations and basic functions.  That was the selling point for me.  I didn't want something to overwhelm her in the beginning.

If you're thinking about getting this for professional work, it probably won't work for you.  However, for students who want to dabble in animation, it's perfect.  The beginners mode is definitely a selling point for our homeschooled granddaughter."
"I had Norton before and this is just a re-up. If I didn't care for it, I wouldn't be using it."
"I have been a long-time user of FamilyTree Maker software and a big fan since they first started.  I am also a long-time subscriber to Ancestry.com.  With FamilyTree Maker 2011, their new software has become increasingly complicated and difficult to understand.  There is WAY too much 'going on.'  What was once simple and straight-forward to enter, see, and retrieve as far as information, notes and photos on individual family members is now all over the place.  I can no longer recommend FamilyTree Maker software.  It is not 'fun', and certainly not easy-to-use.  If you're a beginning genealogist, try getting hold of one of their older versions - like FamilyTreeMaker 16 - where each family member appears on a clear single page of their own - where you can enter a spouse and children - and their parents names appear above them, and you can easily access notes, facts and photos without four dozen other things going on.  The current version is overkill and I think that in spite of all the hype and tying the product into their TV show, many people will be turned off to this unnecessarily overly complicated, difficult-to-understand newer version.  This really was a case of ""if ain't broke don't fix it.""  The makers took what was an excellent concept and product and overworked it to death and I think scared off their loyal consumer base - myself included.  Go back to basics and at the very least continue to offer upgraded versions of the simpler version for those of us not interested in all of the distracting bells and whistles!"
"I installed the trail version on a Win 7 64 bit machine with 8 GB of RAM.  The first several hours went fine but then the program stopped responding any time I tried to go from one component to another, that is between the Editor, Organizer and Express Lab.  Doing a restart did not help the problem.  I stopped trying to move from component to component and just tried to work in the Editor but the program shutdown while working there too.  It looks like it has a lot of nice features and for the money it would probably be a very nice program if it ran without problems.  Applying some of the effects takes quite a bit of time even with 8 GB of memory!  One option I did like is that you can use ""large icons"" in the user interface which helps when the monitor is set to a high resolution.  They were very small and hard to read on the default setting. I have not explored much of the program but if it continues not to run, I probably never will.  Too bad, I think it has potential."
"We have never had creativity when it came to our landscaping, so I trusted that the folks at HGTV would be able to help. I really wanted to take advantage of the upcoming rainy season to get our yard in order. This program really delivered! We not only used the software to visualize and choose the plants and fence we wanted, but we also took it one step further and planned out a beautiful deck and seating area. We haven't built this part yet, but seeing it on the screen is so much fun.

Download was easy enough and reload went fairly quick.
"I went away from Norton about two years ago because the performance was terrible compared to other products.  They have now caught up with the other products in performance.  Why I returned was because of price, performance improvement and confidence in the product.  I have been impressed with the performance, it almost like a ghost protecting my PCs."
I have used this particular software for several years. Over the years I have found that the pure version takes a little more computer resources but doesn't slow the computer down. I recommend this product.
"I had some minor problems downloading the software the first time because my computer shut down 1/3 of the way into the download.  A message said that it was no problem and that the download would pick up where it had left off when my computer shut off when I was ready to resume the download...  This didn't happen, but I was able to re-download the entire version onto my computer a second time around and was not ""charged"" for a second license (as I feared might happen).  I alsogot it easily loaded to my husband's computer as well, and still have a license left over!  In the 6 weeks that Norton has been active on both our machines, we haven't received any alerts to malware or other bad bugs.  Are we lucky or is Norton really doing its anti-virus job quietly and efficiently?  Don't know for sure, but Ive used Norton in the past at my work site and like its ease of use and good annual price ($26 or $28?) for 3 licenses."
"Avast! is a first-rate  program:  Other anti-virus programs take a long time to scan files, and others, such as Norton 360 have a habit of scanning your computer when it thinks the computer is idle, even though you may be downloading a program."
"I am very excited about the endless possibilites of this software.  I have been taking videos of my children since my daughter was born, (now 4 years old and also a 9 month old son now too) Now I can take all those videos and put them together into a great presentation for them when they grow up.  The software is easy to use and comes with a great instruction book.  I am new to video editing software and found this package to be perfect for someone who is new to video editing.  I am very impressed with the software and can't wait to put some great DVD's together."
"I did not want that ps it is a DVD not a cd
I want windows 95 cd rom please"
Works well with Windows 10.  Have it installed on three computers and it seamlessly provides the protection and security desired.  Would recommend.
"I got an A in my college Algebra class. It has been almost 30 years since I took H.S. Algebra...and I didn't understand it then.

I knew I had to have some help. The ""Intermediate Algebra"" textbook gave very limited instructions on how to solve the problems. My school is online and with the interactive seminars being only an hour long, the instructor was limited on being able to teach method. This software is offered at my school. I am so glad I found this step-by-step solution software. If I hadn't, I am 100% sure I would have FAILED the course."
"I am a full time collage student, I was getting a D in english, and with this program, I end the class with a B. I have a lot of trouble typing and with this program the grade shows the results."
"After suffering through endless problems with Panda Platinum Internet Security and their worthless tech support, I finally removed it from my system and installed PC-Cillin.  I chose PC-Cillin because it was rated as best overall by Consumer Reports.  They were not kidding! PC-Cillin installed without a problem, is easy to understand and configure, has worked flawlessly.  System scans are very fast and can be precisely configured.  My system performance has also improved markedly.  FYI, my O/S is Windows 2000 Professional."
I have been using Street Atlas since it went on the market.  I am not happy Garman is not continuing this great program.  I do not like any GPS program you can not choose your route.
An absolute life-saver while traveling in Southern Ireland. Popped in the card and worked right away!!
works with VERSA CHECK SOFTWARE and most other check printing software at a cheaper price.
"work well for me, will buy again if needed, help me with my taxes and filing my tax returns, must purchase the state separately."
nice
"I use True Image not only to back up my hard drive (programs, files, EVERYTHING), so that I can restore it exactly, but I've also used it to clone my hard drive so that I can swap it out for a new, faster SSD.  It has worked perfectly on all 3 computers I've upgraded to SSDs.  The only thing I would mention is when cloning to a smaller drive, make sure you leave enough room in the D: Recovery drive (the program lets you specify the size of the drive), or you'll get an annoying ""out of disk space"" message occasionally."
Very good deal.  Quick response to questions.
"My grandma has been working on our family tree for a few years and
between her information and this program, I was able to work up a very
nice family tree that I printed up and am giving to my family as gifts
for Christmas.  FTM was easy to use and I thought it was fun.  My aunt
is working on a tree for the other side of my family, and I
recommended she give FTM a try to make it easier.

"Before I purchased MS Office 2010 professional, I used Windows Live Mail as my default email client, everything was fine and fast. After I began using Outlook 2010, suffering began. Crashing, slow response, etc. happened frequently. MS support didn't provide any useful advice."
"This version has all the features of PowerDirector 11 Ultra, but adds two powerful modules, ColorDirector and SoundDirector to take your videos even further.  If you like Ultra, but want to be able to have more control over color and audiomixing this version gives you that added functionality.  I have used a lot of different video editing packages, but this one has it all from special effects to titles and onboard DVD authoring and web sharing.  It is light on system resources even when editing high definition and very stable.  I experienced no crashes while using this software, which is more than I can say for some of it's competiors.  If you wish to add more professional flair to your productions, especially if you do music vidoes then the added modules definitely are something you'd be interested in.  If having that many options and that much control doesn't interest you, you might want to start with one of the other version--but this is a software you can grow into as your skills grown.  I highly reccomend it.  I also wanted to add if you have PhotoDirector you can send photos for your production over to it for more extensive editing and effects as it integrates nicely with the program and doesn't require you go out of PowerDirector and then into the other program completely and back again."
"It sure beats doing it by hand!
I had questions and was stymied a couple of times.
I was able to find the questions in the FAQ where others had asked in the group.
All my questions found had the same answer: This question has not yet been answered.
Seeing it was March 15th, I expected more attention to detail from Intuit/Turbotax"
Great deal works good for the price.
"Although I love the ability to use the collections, it's just a bit tedious to use. I don't like that control screen too much to look at in the beginning (it would be better last like it used to be), but I do like the menu at the bottom.  It is too hard to access notes,  bookmarks and the like.  I like the app picture; it distinguishing from other apps."
"Excellen, will purchase another one next year"
It still dosn't work.  The only way I can read any books is so time consuming and difficult that I'm about ready to scream.  I go through a lot of books since I'm home bound. Are you ever going to get this app working again?
This is the first time that I have ever bought and or used anything like this and they made it easy. I just followed the instructions and it has been doing a wonderful job helping to keep my computer clean. It even got rid of trojans. I'm pretty happy with its performance and price.
"I bought this for my 1.5 year old son and he has played it nearly every day for 6 months. Driving me crazy. So I picked up some other titles and really see that this one is special, none of the others come close to be as educational or interesting. He started out on the baby which is great that you don't need to use the mouse at all to play, just hit anywhere on the keyboard. On Toddler, you can get away without the mouse in many places but the mouse makes it more interesting and it has actually taught him how to move it to accomplish a task. He can navigate the scenes on his own and play all the games. It is great but he is starting to need to  be challenged a bit more."
"I think this product is fantastic, easy to use on my mac and would recommend it to anyone who would like Office on their Mac.  I wish it would include Publisher, but it does not."
"I installed this on my 3 PCs last week. I don't know what Norton has done to screw up their product, but all 3 of my PCs are running more sluggishly since install. There also appears to be some kind of conflict with Google Chrome. I sure am wishing I did not upgrade to 6.0. Perhaps it is time for a change to a different internet security suite. I do not recommend this product."
"security? why do I needed, but this a good value for the buck, loads quick and problem free and only one I use."
"Virobot Expert catches out every virus, and repaires it quickly. Fast speed and low storage show why this is better than Norton Anti-Virus."
"Easiest, quickest upgrade ever using flash drive."
Arrived on time. Works great!  Thanks!!
great program ... works well for when you are traveling ........... just load on your computer and no need to have a reader :-)
A great sub for Microsoft Word!
"I have had CAC since it first came out in the 90's by far the best of the best, I too like many other reviews here have an older XP that
I use especially for making cards, business cards, add a photo, and lots of fun projects. Now just yesterday when I went to make a card
it wouldn't let me access the art work and all my saved work was gone. I know that XP is now obsolete and it will no longer offer any support
so what does that mean? Now even my XP won't function? I have 2 laptops with XP and 1 desktop that is the one I use for my CAC3.
My main computer is a Win 7 home addition and it is not compatible. I hate losing the use of my other older computers. I read that if I get
Win 7 Professional I can use virtual XP and it will work, has anyone else experienced using the virtual XP on win 7? I am so bummed out.."
"The lastest version of Norton's 360 product is really starting to come together nicely.  In previous versions, it still seemed like several diffferent products simply stuck together to make a single product.  In this version, all of the different components seem to be integrated into one single easy to use package and central interface.  You still have to deal with different interfaces once you begin to drill down into each individual component.  Overall I am pleased with the performance, the capabilities of each component, the centralized management and the protection this product provides.  My only complaint is that some of the components still feel a bit clumzy and require some manual configuration or manipulation to work correctly.  For example, when setting up the trust map and network map of your home network, the interface seems very clumzy and it does not automatically detect the device type or even the device name for you.  All of this has to be entered in manually, which can become a real nightmare if you have several items within your network.  What makes this task even harder, is that this whole function did not feel well thought out or easy to use like the other areas of the product.  It wasn't clear as to which settings to use for each device or what each setting really meant.  I still find that part of the product unclear and not well thought out.  There are other small areas that I felt needed improvement as well, but that piece seemed to be the one that really seemed lacking compared to the rest of the product.  All-in-all though, this product would be a great asset for any user to own to secure their systems from modern security threats from all areas, as well as to ease the never ending task of managing user names and passwords for everything we touch theses days.  I really can't wait until something easier comes along in that area..."
Wonderful for learning the meaning of scriptures

"I have been a Money user for a decade or more.  I use it for both business and personal finances.  I liked being able to track all of my business expenses in one place and knowing how much profit/loss I've made since day 1.  I was really worried when I read that Money was going off the market, and disappointed to find that there really aren't any comparable products on the market.  I decided to give Quicken a try, although I was scared by the negative reviews.

I had no trouble at all importing the files from Money.  Everything transferred over, although I did have to spend a little time changing the name of some of the online banking services so that they matched Quicken's.  It also took me a little time to figure out how to set up the business side of things.  But now that everything is set up, it's running smoothly.  There are still some things that aren't great (when I have a transfer between accounts, it doesn't automatically figure things out; I have to go in and adjust things on one side to put it in the right category then go delete the duplicate transaction in the other account), but it wasn't nearly as bad as I feared.

Yes, Money is a little bit slicker in appearance.  But Quicken doesn't really look like something from 1994.  Everything is in one spot, and it's easy to see where the money is coming from and going to.  I like that the business side has the tax categories for schedule C all set up.  Of course it takes a bit of customizing to make it fit my own business needs, but for the most part I haven't had any trouble at all."

"Don't be fooled, I have a real printed Brittanica encyclopedia and it is head and shoulders above this thing in quality and depth.
Some articles in the real volumes have 10 pages full of information and pictures in comparison to 5 abbreviated paragraphs on the CD version.  Also the ""childrens"" and ""teenage"" versions are needless baggage, who wants to look at a dumbed down version of the same document?  Kids, get used to the real world you can handle English.  If you want a kids book, go read Barney & Friends.

Anyway keeping my 1970 Brittanica set it has much more than the ""Ultimate Reference"" which is more like the ultimate indexed flash card set.............. C-"
"I read the rave reviews and bought this game - I found it way too easy to complete all the levels.  The challenges weren't all that complex and the difficulty didn't seem to increase as you moved up levels.  I still gave it 3 stars as it was fun and novel to do and you can certainly appreciate the programming that went into it - but, good programming doesn't always translate into a great game."
"best anti-virus I've ever used, which says a lot because I am a computer virus magnet."

these are my favorite games and i own almost all of them just need a few more cant wait to get them
I am a novice at computers and I wanted to copy some cds.  This was easy to load and is a great price.  I would recommend this for anyone who wants to copy cds.

"I'm a professional storyboard artist. I use Painter every day.  There is no real viable competition to Painter when it comes to simulating brushes, pencils, etc, digitally.  I'm stuck with using it. I just upgraded from Painter 11 to Painter 12.  You can do some pretty amazing stuff with Painter.  You will also get some pretty amazing headaches.

Painter is the buggiest software that i have ever used.  And it has the worst product support i've ever encountered.  Support is noneexistant.  Even when you pay 20 bucks to call and ask a question, the chance of having a problem solved is minimal.  If you point out a legitimate bug with Painter, Corel will confirm the bug--but then tell you that ""the problem you encountered is not a product defect, however, [it is] a change in the new version"".

that's an actual quote from Corel product support when i pointed out that Painter 12 was saving corrupted jpeg files.  sheesh.  Really, Corel changed Painter 12 to save corrupted jpeg files--on purpose?!

I'll say this, the phone people are polite and try to help, but they have their hands tied behind their backs because Corel isn't interested in solving any problems.

Once you buy into painter, they have you by the short and curlies.  They know you can't go anywhere else and therefore corel doesn't have any motivation to make their product better.  Check out Painter forums before you buy.  You will see that people are complaining of the same bugs from version, to version, to version.  they never get fixed.

the sad thing is, you'll probably have to use Painter anyway.  Like i said, there's no real viable alternative.  But at least you'll know in advance the hair-pulling that you are in for.  sigh.

"Wow. I am thrilled. Just downloaded Audiozilla. Very easy. I have been looking hard for software that would convert flac files to wave files. The freeware, Flac Frontend, has had lots of problems with both windows 7 and 8. I was about to give up. I just tried Audiozilla to convert the flac files and it does a great job.

It is also extremely easy. Thanks a ton."
"This product was dodgy enough under Macspeech: since Nuance bought it, it's degenerated into an entirely unusable piece of crap. The latest fiasco around Yosemite compatibility  in which you can't even install the company's Yosemite ""update"" due to software glitches  tells you all you need to know about their commitment to it. I've wasted far more time trying to make this programme work  and trying to access Nuance ""support""  than it has ever saved me in productivity, not to mention the ulcers. Do yourself a favour; pass on it."
"Upgrading the the new Quicken 2015 for Mac was super simple and easy.  I must admit, I was skeptical as I tried to upgrade to Quicken Essentials a few years ago from an older Quicken version and had a heck of a time.  But this upgrade was fantastic.  I also like the new layout and ease of using it.  If you are using Quicken and a Mac, this is a must have."
"I don't have a huge amount of time to write up, but wanted to get a few words out there. The update is nice with some smoother functions/ views. Budgeting really sucks and I get much better and smoother results with a separate Excel spreadsheet. Next, and this has been a problem for YEARS, is that there is not a simple option to include future CC charges in the IN/OUT/WHAT's LEFT views.

For example, we charge EVERYTHING on CC to get points and don't pay interest (usually). Anything scheduled on a CC does not show up. I can see going either way, depending on your personal budget and financial philosophy, but stupid that it is locked out.

As for the mobile app. It's OK. What I really hate is that you can not see scheduled events in the mobile app. So, if you typically charge $50 a week in gas on CC 1, you can not pull that up on the app and apply it. HUGE shortfall on Inuits side. Lastly, sync is PAINFULLY slow.

The rest, of the app and main product is nice."
"I love this software, I got it to put on my 2011 MBP, and it runs flawlessly on it. I needed a Windows system to run for my job, and this provided me with that.

The installation process was fool proof, and all features are working perfectly. So nice to have a Windows computer just a click away."
Very pleased with its operation and speed.  It is able to run ACI's appraisal software flawlessly.
Good
After it was all over with this year my tax return was 40 pages. I'm not sure how anyone does their taxes anymore without Turbotax (or an accountant). I know Intuit does something that ticks people off in various ways occasionally but all things considered I am very happy with TurboTax for Mac. This year it was pretty flawless. I have been using Turbotax for 15 years (and MacinTax before that) and it seems to get more refined and yet more user friendly and easier every year.
great program worth the cost
"Came as expected, installed easily, works well."
"I was surprised at how easy this was to download to my computer and at the large selection of music that was available through my Prime membership.  It's not music either.  You've got Brad Pasley, Maranda Lambert, Carrie Underwood, Blake Shelton and a lot of other country singers.  You guessed it, I love country music.  It also encompasses all genres of music, so I know you'll find something that you'll love.  Give it a try, you'll be glad you did."
"After reading several reviews I decided to switch to H&R from Turbo tax because of them removing Schedule C and cost.  The install and set up went smooth.  It imported my Turbo tax info great.  I am clergy so we have several different sometimes confusing tax situations, but H&R seemed to include them...until I went to state taxes.  After completing everything I noticed I have a nice credit because of property tax, a credit I didn't receive last year because my total income was too high.  The reason is because H&R forgot to include housing allowance back into calculating the credit (specifically mentioned in Michigan 1040CR instructions)...oops.  Then went to ask a tax question to clarify if I am right (and more likely to notify them of the error to correct) and was directed to the technical support chat room every time.  I am sure they will get this figured out but really...directing people to the wrong chat rooms, not very professional for a company that has been doing this as long as H&R."

"For the last 10 yr's I've been using Quicken 99, Then decieded to up-grade to Quicken 2009.
  At first I thought "" Oh No What Have I done! ""...Thinking I'd loose everything I had in Quicken 99 When I switched-over to Quicken 2009.
But the transition was as smooth as silk, Quicken 2009 brought everything over from Quicken 99, with (NO) problems.
  If you are using an Older vesion of Quicken...Please Up - grade now, you will not be sorry, Like anything that looks different, It takes some getting used to, I was up and running in Apx. 20 min. Although it took me 2 days to get the hang of it(part-time) Computer user...It is so very worth it.

MARK FROM OREGON"
I went from a 2010 version to this one. I was made to believe from numerous emails from quicken that if I didn't upgrade I would no longer be able to download bank info. It now says my checking acct spending for the month is in a minus state. How can that be? I have no idea how to fix it. It was fine in the 2010 version. So like I said a big waste of money to upgrade for what.
"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Webroot-Secureanywhere-Complete/dp/B005CSF1JK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Webroot Secureanywhere Complete</a>Simple, fast and non-intrusive.  Webroot has found a way to set itself apart, yet again, with it's revolutionary new software.  Unlike most protection software, (including old versions of Webroot) they do not rely on bulky, resource hogging, definition based software.  Instead, the nearly invisible (in terms of size) software is behavior based and is run practically remotely.  Finally I can use my computer again and not have to worry about malicious ANYTHING getting in my way.  As an added bonus to people still burdened by dial up, the program downloads and installs itself within a couple of minutes on slow speeds and does not require daily or weekly updates as your old software required."
I do believe that the software is very easy to follow.  I have used it for many years now.  I do believe they can improve some of the help features but it is still a great tool.
"this sucks.  I should have got the basic anti virus.  2 weeks into it, and my hard drive crashes.  It started running much slower when it was installed and I should have seen it coming."
"I've used Office 2003 since it came out and have been very happy with it.  While there are a few more bells than 2003, I don't see a significant improvement over 2007's successor.  Do I wish I hadn't bought it? No, there are a lot of templates that only work on Office 2007 that are dodgy at best on 2003.
Would I say run out and get this. No.  Since Vista we have all been waiting for something new from Microsoft to come out that really is an improvement."
"I'm writing this review using  MacSpeech Dictate program. I will not correct any errors that may come along during the transcription. What do I think about this program? It has learned my voice and generally works well in spelling correctly things I dictate. My problem with the program is what it does not do, particularly in comparison with the Dragon speech program. In Dragon speech I am able to dictate in programs such as WordPerfect and Word and without touching the keyboard I can save the file and print the document. I have not been able to do this with the MacSpeech Dictate program. If the program is capable of doing this, then the documentation is woefully inadequate for showing the user how to do some of these things. If the program is not capable of doing this, the question is why not?

For me the value of  software lies in how well it does little things as well as the big things.  wife certainly enjoy-that did not come out right. I certainly enjoy being able to dictate, but it would be very helpful to be able to do formatting tasks and printing tasks as well without having to use my hands or the mouse.

That's my $.10"
"This is a fun bit of software, and is a nice way to augment your Russian studies in an entertaining way, but I don't see how anyone could learn Russian using this product alone.  The first CD is akin to a memory game which teaches some random, thematically linked vocabulary.  Just when you think you're becomming a master, you move on to CD 2.
The second CD has an entirely different feel than the first, and this is where the ""instant immersion"" comes in.  Suddenly, animated characters are speaking at you in speedy Russian sentences.  Help in English disappears and, even though neither disc gives any instruction in the cyrillic alphabet, you are suddenly expected to be able to read.  Was there a CD 1A that I missed?
I plan to go back to CD 2 as I learn more Russian.  I think its games will be a fun way to review-- once I learn from some other means..."
"I've been using Quicken for many years, since the early 2000's.  This upgrade lets me track my business and rental properties."
Did not recognize my Product Key.
Basically this software is very simple to use but I can't get the detailed information in some scenarios. It's not true that everything is explained in details. And the thing is TurboTax does not have free online support when we want to ask something about their product or let them know their software defects.
Apparently Amazon hasn't figured out people may actually want to download the music THEY PAID FOR.
excellent
I was very pleased with this anti-virus.  Very easy to install and is now protecting my computer and my laptop.  Good value too.
Regions and first state bank aren't working w new version. I've spent an hour and a half with a regions' banker and it's still not working. Very frustrating.
Great product! Increased my sons typing speed and accuracy tremendously...
"For the price, Bitdefender's Internet Security 2009 (Family Edition) is bargain priced.  First, customers can run the program on three computers. Second, the program can be used for two years without additional costs, while it has all the features of the more costly Norton Internet Security.  It does lack some desirable features of Norton 360, Version 2.0.  But Norton 360 is more costly and subscription must be renewed every year.  If you want more features like Tune-up, Back-up, or Online Back-up, Bitdefender offers another similar program called Total Security 2009.  It has all the features of Norton 360, Version 2, and it also sells with a two year subscription.

I have installed and used Internet Security 2009 on Windows XP for almost two months without any problem. In fact, my computers seem to run a little faster than they did when using Norton 360 - for all Norton's claims of tuning up the P.C. and optimizing its performance. Additionally, Bitdefender's Internet Security 2009 runs without annoyingly drawing as much attention to itself as does Norton 360.

I'm permitted to update this review, and I will if I experience any problems.  Until then, I can only say that Bitdefender's Internet Security 2009 is a good program and a really good buy.

12/19/09 UPDATE: After using this program for about three months I took it off to install Kaspersky Internet Security 2010.  After the install and update, I ran a full scan and found a missed virus on one computer, a network threat and a privacy threat on a second computer.  This is not good, but it could be worse.  Neither the virus or the other missed threats caused me any harm.  And Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 is an incredable improvement over anything they have ever produced - possibly better than anything on store shelves.

If I could I would change this review rating to 4 stars."
I'm still learning. Any problems are with me. I'm not the most patient of persons but will eventually get there.
"Mac Speech Dictate is so much better than I was led to believe. It's not perfect, but it is really accurate and actually pretty fun to use."
The software appears to be kosher.  I have installed it without any problems on Windows 8 and I am able to read and edit all my old  CAD files.  Excellent value when one considers the price of the latest version.
I was a Quicken Beta tester for 2009 Quicken Rental Property Manager.  Each year Quicken has refined and added new features to it's financial software. This program builds on the Quicken platform. The Rental Property Manager adds tracking rental properties and rental property businesses to the Quicken financial software package. This new dimension provides valuable financial and tax tracking for those in the rental property business.
"It keep trying to come on as soon as I log in and I can't stop it.  I only want it when I want it, not every time I log in."
I needed it.

"I installed this and was concerned that it may not work well on OS X 10.8.2 (latest from Apple), and it's working just fine for me. I was able to update it without any issues as well. Ofcourse its still too early for me to start entering tax information, but having used Turbo Tax from the last 6 years, I don't expect any issues. It makes taxes so easy."
The download went well. I have downloaded several Books previously and each were successful.
"I have been computer geek for the last forty years, but I just do not understand this dvd.  I have tried the 32 bit cinnamon and it crashed.  I have tried the 32 bit MATE and it looks promising, but after 2 plus hours I am about to punt this windows xp PC, it just needs to be trashed. The 64 bit systems will not install since the CPU does not meet hardware requirements ( I had already figured that with out the software)."
"We have Tonka Contruction 2, Tonka Workshop, and Fisher Price Big Action Construction -- all good toys.  We just got Dig 'n Rigs the other day and  I'd have to say that this toy is an order of magnitude  better than the  others.  The user interface is excellent - everything is in 3D, yet it's  easy to navigate. It allows kids to actually drive the trucks from the  truck lot to various construction sites, then operate the fairly realistic  controls.  The game has more degrees of freedom than Tonka Workshop.  My  son (not quite 3 years old yet) would easily sit at the computer and play  this game for hours if I let him."
Apple product are great i have been on there team for about 18 years love the product love Apple thank you
I have used this for over 10 years. I love the product but will never buy again. after what they did by taking out modules and never telling anyone. They have lost my business.
Quick delivery and was easy to upload to my computer

"Well, I have been a loyal TurboTax buyer for years and years and years.  I thought my tax situation was so simple, I wouldn't run into the Deluxe vs. Premier situation.  No rental property, no exotic investments, nothing at all complex.  Income from my job, normal retirement/health savings account/savings funds, housing & charity deductions and a small money-market type investment with Edward Jones.  I read through and tried to understand to make sure I was okay with Deluxe.  Ha!  That 'small' investment means I should have bought Premier.  I called the hotline, they upgraded me for $10.  I hope Intuit enjoys that $10, that's the last money I'm sending their way.  I'm so irritated.  The (very nice) person on the hotline mentioned TurboTax knows they did a poor job of marketing it.  That is not it at all - this isn't a marketing problem.  It's a problem in how they are opting to run their business.  Count me as one of those who will be searching for a new tax software next year."
I am pleased with the performance and flexibility of this version of office.  I am getting exactly what I need from the system.  Thanks
"This product is comprehensive and easy to use.  Plus when I had a problem with how I filed (not the fault of TurboTax), I called back, spoke to a real person and they helped me to amend my filing and save me money.
How cool is that?!"
"The item was NOT as advertised, it was a completely different item which I had to buy drivers to enable it to work - which it didn't.  I returned it but have NOT heard anything since.  Beware!!"
I feel very safe with this product in my computer
"I bought MacSpeech Dictate today in spite of the mixed reviews. My experience is that installation was without difficulty, the training was quick and easy, and execution surpasses my expectations. This review is dictated using MacSpeech Dictate and going through the very brief training session. Again, expectations exceeded.

The question with any software is how much it will actually be used. Time will tell, but initial impressions are great period online support could be more robust but this will come with time.  note small air indication --Note small error in dictation. -- preceding errors common to all voice recognition programs. Huge improvement over my experience with ViaVoice."
"When we were in italy the streets were shown perfectly and we did not get lost ONCE! Excellent buy, and very good idea."
"I BOUGHT THIS QUICKBOOKS PRO 2008 HERE AND IT WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MY TIME
AND MONEY. IT TURNED OUT TO BE A BOOTLEG COPY AND NOT EVEN A GOOD ONE.

IT LOOKS REAL WITH SERIAL AND PRODUCT #S AND ALL. QB'S HAD NO MATSHING #;S
BUT AT LEAST THEY TRIED TO HELP. THIS SUPPLIER WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE , AMAZON
WOULD NOT REPLY SO I ATE $160.00 AND DO NOT BUY HERE EVER AGAIN..."
"I got free upgrade(pro version) and I'm happy with it, new Windows Store is finally usable(meaning user experience), UI is much more unified, even for old programs.
All my old software and hardware works fine, even external GPU.
As for privacy policy if you don't freak out about social media and other cloud services' privacy policies then here's nothing to freak out, MS just doing it's job and getting some anonymous information for feature improvement purposes(that's actually nothing new in any other company case too)."
I have used Turbo Tax for three years now. I find it very easy to follow and  very complete. I did the Federal Tax and State tax and I like the way that one talks to the other and forwards info from Fed to State so you don't have to do it twice. If you use it more than one year it also talks to last years taxes and saves you more time and work. So I am a happy customer and will be using it again next year. The electronic E Filing is great too. Nice not to have to leave the house and its all done.
"This is a very cool program if you are keen on learning typing. Clean, clear and easy"
"I actually bought MacSpeech Scribe, and for my purposes, it's useless.  It's so much faster to just transcribe by hand.  I did train quite a bit and used clear audio files with no background noise  If the Scribe transcriptions  were 60% right AND there was a decent editor that allowed you to get the job done faster, it would not have been a complete waste.  It's the lame editing capabilities that makes it a total waste.  For example, Scribe gives me about 15 options of one segment of audio.  It's faster to type than go through all Scribe's choices looking for the best.  OK, so I don't look through the long list.  I choose the first and edit so it's correct.  That could be useful, BUT when the user edits this segment Scribe erases the audio corresponding to that that segment of text so the user can't play the audio again to double check.  This was a total waste.  There's a reason there's no trial version.  No one would buy it if there were. Oh yeah,you'd think they'd allow standard flash video input (.flv) but it doesn't.  I used excellent freeware to extract the audio it needed for Scribe."
Fills the he bill.  I've used it for years and it has never let me down.  It has been a good product.
Love it. I read more on my phone when I'm traveling than my actual kindle because it's already in my hand.
"I downloaded the latest trial version, and the features I need don't work. It wouldn't work with a Blu-Ray disc, and didn't include secondary audio tracks or subtitles. I tried the direct support link, but it generated an error and suggested e-mailing them directly. Although I found three support addresses, mail to all of them bounced back with a message in Chinese.  In light of the fact that the product's advertised features don't work, and no technical support is available, I don't recommend this product."
This is better than the CD version. Work for my needs to visualize my designs and decor.
"While the idea behind this application is great (an electronic version of the Franklin Covey system integrated into Microsoft Outlook), the design and development of the application is terrible.
This software is so pooly designed and full of bugs that I find it completely unusable."
"This Dazzle, worth my money, it came perfect it was at my door wrapped finely and nothing was wrong with it, and it works great, i never had trouble with this product. BEST thing i bought from this site."
"How on earth one opens a second image and ends up with two canvases is beyond me. In PS it is a snap.  Here, Rhoda says to use Command or Control and open the second image but that just replaces the first one, every time.  Extremely frustrating.  The rapid pace and obvious voice compression doesn't help, either.  Most of the DVD is good but getting hung up on impossible and poorly explained tasks makes me wonder if I'm wasting my time."
"I have media player, real player, and quicktime on my pc, but they still run after I installed emc8.  Count me as someone who hasn't had conflict problems.

If you are new to disk authoring, this program is perfect 'cause you can follow the menus and burn the type of discs you want.  If you're more experienced you still have a myriad of choices and some options outside of the menu system.

I haven't done a lot of editing except for photos.  No complaints here, there are plenty of features to fix and alter them.  I never thought of making slide shows but the program makes it so easy I've ended up making a lot of them.  The program shows all the photos on your pc or disc in one place.  You can just push the ctrl key and click on the photos you want to add to the show.  Then you choose your template style and transitions.  That's it.  If you want a more elaborate show then you can use other options.  Very easy and fast."
"With regards to the download issue, no there is no .exe file. Instead, you're given a big set of zip folders that you need to unzip to whichever directory you'd like to install Poser in. The installation file is located in the ""Poser9-Poser9-Installer"" folder. Not too tricky, but maybe a bit much for novices. It certainly would have been nicer had they just included a .exe file, but I'm sure there's a good reason why they didn't. The total file size is 4.3 GB, which only took about 20 minutes for me to download. Not bad!

If you can't afford to shell out the dough for Poser Pro 2012, then Poser 9 is a decent substitute. It's the oldest version that's going to be compatible with the latest DAZ figures (with converter), and that's all I really needed it for personally. Note: If you're importing your Poser work into an older version of Vue (prior to Vue 10), then it's my understanding that it's not compatible. Poser 8 is compatible and Poser Pro 2012 is compatible, but due to some weird release date issues, Poser 9 will only work with Vue 10 and later."
"I got Microsoft student 2007, and it works great i have 8 programs including word, powerpoint, access, onenote, groove, excel outlook and publisher.  Works great for a college student needing good powerpoints ect.  On the other hand it is a bit tricky to use, you do have to learn a few new things, and were everything relocated too."
"With all of the negative reviews, it took me a while to get the courage to buy this product.  On January 1st, I upgraded from Q Essentials to this Q 2015 for MAC program.  I had absolutely no problems at installation or since.  Take the plunge...the newer program is a step up.  Intuit has not sent an upgrade for Q Essentials in over a year, apparently, this is it.  Enjoy."
"A few things are a little different / getting used to from the 2013 Windows version, but works grear"
"Does what it says on the box, easy to install. Have been using this product for years and in my opinion is better than Norton and McAfee.  Would definitely recommend."
Very easy to use and doesn't slow my PC. Works great!
"I've been using Turbo Tax for twenty years. A few years ago I switched (from a CPA) to TurboTax for my C-corp too.  But now, when you add up all separate charges for software and e-filing, for federal and state, personal and business... the fees to Turbo Tax are running into hundreds of dollars. Even the ""package"" deals still require additional e-filing or state preparation charges that should be included if it's a true package.  For this money I can hire a pro, but I'll switch to a more reasonably priced product, even if I have to manually carry-over some data the first year."
"OK version of tax preparation software.  It's hard to say anything too nice about something you hate to begin with (TAXES).  However, it is the only tax program I would buy!"
"I have just given up on this product. The installation went well but as soon as I started the program, CPU usage went to 100% and system eventually crashed. I spent over 6 hours today going through 3 support techs and re-installing Quicken 2009 four times before giving up. I will be returning this and hope to receive full refund, but the time and frustration...?"
"Why pay more for Turbo Tax, when this does just as good a job. Glad I made the switch. word."
Rather get OpenOffice free than pay for a software I have to spend yearly to get. Got this software on laptop and now can't use software other than to look at papers. Will most likely use older MS Office.
"As I have found with McAfee, there are always problems. This time it is ""verify your subscription"" message at least once a day. I have contacted McAfee via online chat 3 times and although they have tried, they have failed. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the McAfee 3 times and now given up. I will get PCcillin from now on. Have it on my other machines and it is transparent."
"For the 2015 tax year I was going to use TaxAct since I had a free coupon code. It was taking a lot longer to use the online based TaxAct software, about an hour into using TaxAct, I decided that I needed to go back to TurboTax. TurboTax makes things so much easier. It will import data from several sources and really hold your hand through the process. The explanations are also superior."
"Be careful, this here only works if you use in in the US. I had to contact customer support for it to work in Asia."
This is a big step up from Parallels 7; better integration into OSX.  Runs much smoother.  I just upgraded my HD to a SSD so Parallels restores a session in less than 10 seconds and Windows reboots in 15-20 seconds.
It reached on time to me. I have been using it and found good. I have not compared this with other antivirus but this gave me good result till now.
"Platinum PrintMaster is so easy to use. Once I had a DVD installed in my computer, I was ready to start! I've used Broderbund products before so this one is no mystery."
"This is the best mapping software around.  I have used all the free mapping services on the web.  You get what you pay for.  The GPS locator included works great.  I used it and a laptop to trace a 400 mile trip.  It was fun.  It worked great and when you bring the resolution to the highest level you can see the streets that you are driving on.  Very cool.  Spend the money and let the ""tourists"" use the free web sites."
"You know, you don't hear about Linux alot. Mostly Windows & Mac. But, with ultimate security and awesome interface, who can't ignore it? Red Hat 9.0 is the newest Linux by the ultimate Linux peeps, Red Hat. Red Hat is awesome. I have 2 computers in my house. One running Windows XP, just cuz I run alot of program on it, and I just upgraded an old Windows 98 computer to Red Hat 9, and I'm happy I did. Linux is just a great alternative to Windows.

Best deal I could find when my 2013 Norton Antivirus ran out.  Now I have additional protection (the firewall replaces a freebie that I have been using) and all of my household computers are running NIS 2014!
"Actualy I've had this program for years, I was just replacing it because the original became corrupt.
It's a fine program and works well."
The description indicates that this s/w is for PC or Mac. It will not load onto my Mac. Amazon should be ashamed of itself.
"This game is pretty fun at first, but it gets old very fast. You are called to do a certain task around the island, which is cool, until you get through the tasks and do the same ones over and over again. The only part I thought was real good about this game was the exciting car race. But compared to the other Lego PC games, this is quite boring."
"I purchased this product to design all of the printing necessary for our daughter's wedding.  The program appeared to have a glitch on my computer.  Customer service at Mountaincow was excellent.  Josh responded immediately and worked with me until the problem was solved. (my computer, not their product) I have no design experience but with a little patience am very impressed with the invitations I've been able to put together.
Their excellent customer service and product make this an easy recommendation!"
"I have had both good and extremely bad experiences with Norton products. I have had two computers completely crash because of Norton products, and I vowed that I would never use another one. However, my Kaspersky license was expiring, and I read the rave reviews of Norton 2009 on both here at Amazon and on various sites with reviews of computer software. I decided to give Norton another try based on the fact that even former Norton haters had been won over by this product.

When I first installed it, I was impressed with the speed with which my computer operated. However, within hours, everything began to go haywire. I uninstalled it and then reinstalled it. Again, it worked for several hours, then every program I worked on caused the screen to freeze up. I uninstalled this product, and reinstalled my Kaspersky for the few days I had left on its license. I then purchased Kaspersky Security Suite 2009 and I'm very happy with it.

Based on the fact that reviews of this product and other computer security products are either extremely favorable or unfavorable, I have come to the conclusion that some computers are just not compatible with certain software."
"I've used Turbo Tax for more than 6 years.  I have NEVER had a problem.  It is easy to use, and each year it takes me less and less time to file.  As for any ""errors"" it may calculate -- I still review the actual Tax forms before submitting.  I think everyone should do that.

I highly recommend using Turbo Tax."
Fast Delivery and accurate description of the product.
"I was pleased with the system in general, but very disappointed to find the Home version is not compatible with blutooth headsets.  I still have to sit in front of the computer, connected by a cord, like a 1965 telephone wired to a wall.  The other versions apparently allow blutooth, but not the Home version.  Make this much clearer on the advertising to avoid disappointed customers."
"I needed to upgrade immediately to access a new client's file.  I was able to download and install in less than an hour.  Contrary to other reviewers, I like the new style.  It's sleek and modern, and it stands out from other versions so I don't get confused about which I'm working in.  I have not had time to check out any new features, so I cannot comment on that aspect."
"I love WinFaxPro, as does everyone and every company I fax.  I love the cartoons, the flexibility and most especially a complete copy of everything I have ever faxed to anyone that I can access instantly.

Unfortunately, since Norton got their hands on it (after DelRino -sp?- and Symatec, things have been going downhill.  I don't know if that other person's comment that they never plan on updating to VISTA is true, but if it is, I will be heart-broken.  But I do believe them, as WinFaxPro is not shown on the Symatec website as being one of their products.  But then again, maybe they sold it to someone else?  I refuse to give up completely, when I was able to install 10.03 and it DOES work, altho' it only works for one fax before I have to reboot.  But this is only since I got a Vista machine.  It works fine with XP, SP2 and everything prior.  And if you aren't running Vista, do yourself a favor and get this program.  WinFaxPro is a wonderful program and I have had every version since 2.0!

Once you gotten used to it, you won't know how to live without it!  Which is why everyone here is giving it such low ratings.  It's heart-breaking to lose a great program and with enough pressure, I am sure Symatec will realize that it would be well worth their time to do whatever they have to do to make it work with Vista.  It can't be that difficult.  And WHY id MICROSOFT have to change something in VISTA that EVERY LAST PROGRAM I own has had to be changed to make it work?!?!  I'm sorry, but I can't blame Symatec or WinFax for that.  I have already spent 2 months finding updates for each program I have and I am no-where near finished.  That would be MS's error in my book!  Heck, every driver has to be changed, as well!  I blame Microsoft, myself."
"Tried it and it immediately caused a serious slowdown on my system, I called tech support and they really were slow. Afetr 1/2 hour someone came on who was really rude and knew nothing about the software. I removed it and the problem was gone. terrible software, terrible company."
"I love to download patterns for knitting and crochet, and my tablet just doesn't do the pictures justice. I love being able to see them better on my pc. This is a big help."
"I had a very hard time downloading the product.  I tried it several times w/o success so I called the Norton Help Center.  The first gentleman was foriegn ( I think Indian) and was very hard for me to understand.  He tried hard to help me but othe problem resolved.
I tried again the next day as I was without any security protection.  The second day I spoke with a Female and she was extremely helpful but after several attempts she transferred me to the Notron tech support.  After many attempts we were successful in getting the produce doownloaded and it seems to be working fine.  I have a second computer that I won't get to use for another 4 months so I'll keep my fingers crosseds that I can download it onto that machine as well."
"Received this quickly and went to website to install and had some problems after, but linked with a Mcafee tech and he was great!. He figured out the problem and reinstalled software. I have had Mcafee for several years and have never had any problems so I will stay with them for my computer protection!"
"I'm not a high-tech pro, so take this review as coming from your average casual user. I'm still playing with the program, which is taking me a while to get used to. I don't find it especially intuitive, but that could be because I'm not a prior user. I'm looking forward to experimenting with different features and making some fun videos."
Bought it for my niece. She said it is a little hard to use but likes it.
S***tie program save your money and look for something else trust me.
"Runs silently in the background with no annoyances and a quick Google search gives several independent tests showing it's one of the most effective antivirus programs out as of now, so no complaints here. The top selling point to me is that it takes up less RAM and doesn't have a bunch of useless and troublesome features like many of the competitors."
"This is a good tool to have it keeps your pc running at its best, I'm no expert but it has been easy to use. Have had this on my pc for some time now even installed it on my new one when up dated it, lets you know when it needs clearing out old files and things that slow down your pc."
"Installed this version of Quicken Premier 2014 over my 2011 version.  Was a bit nervous about file corruption and other issues listed by previous people, but none of those issues happened to me. I allowed the program to fully install and update before I did any importing, which may have helped, but regardless, once I got my old file imported, everything worked just fine. All the data was there, my accounts were still listed for one-step update and while I did have to ""reselect"" all my accounts for updating (were unchecked for one-step for some reason) - the rest worked great.

I really haven't delved into the features of this version too much, so can't speak to any of the slowdown that some folks are experiencing, nor have I tried the mobile capability (although I doubt I will, as I don't want my data out on the cloud).  I did note that my ability to accept new transactions takes a little longer (processing perhaps), but not so bad as to cause me to throw up my hands in frustration.  Some of the layout and features I did see upon login seem nice and I am looking forward to testing them further.

Prior to upgrading, I made an additional backup of my files to ensure any ""corruption"" could be reversed.  None occurred, but I highly recommend you make a backup just in case - better safe than sorry.  This upgrade was done because of Intuit's policy of expiring software after three years - so it is highly unlikely I'll upgrade again until 2017.  Hopefully by then, they have made vast improvements that convince users that their software is valuable and not ""buggy"" as stated in so many other reviews.

Overall, this software does exactly what I need it to do - provide a backup to my online financial accounts.  Since banks offer online access these days and hackers are getting more creative, I wanted a record of all my accounts that I can store offline, should there be a reason to prove what I had before the ""incident.""  I don't get paper statements any longer (not to save trees, but because I hated the clutter...and well, trees are cool too), so my only proof of financial ownership is online at the bank, where they store stuff for a few years and then purge it (unless I made offline backup copies of each of those each month).  I find this software does that for me and does it well.  I hope all the other features I have yet to find in this software are just as useful."
Purchasing from Amazon has proved much cheaper than at the store or even renewing with Mcafee.  Not sure why but it works...
Do not buy Kaspersky products => they do not install.  Couple that problem with the fact that amazon.com refuses to provide refunds for software and you are basically throwing away your money.
"Worst document management application I have every used.  I regret the purchase and would not recommend it to anyone.
This program consistently hangs and stops responding."
"Available for free after rebate. Couldn't pass it up.
Running windows XP.
Read the booklet!
Installation went exactly as described.
I no longer have to concern myself about wasting paper and ink and then having to store large printouts.
I expect I will find many other uses for this product."
"This program creates allowed and not-allowed lists for you to put email senders into. You have to indicate for each email which list it belongs in so that future emails from that sender are slotted in the correct file. This is the white list/black list way of doing things. Outlook Express already has this capability in the message rules, plus allows for screening based on words, domains, as well as sender name. So, I couldn't see any reason to pay for the capabilities."
"First off, it's not as easy to use as they let on.  Curved walls took awhile to figure out how to do.  The biggest annoyance though is when you place something and customize it to your liking, it will randomly change back to the stock view.  At first I thought it was the auto-save doing this ( yeah kinda defeats the purpose of auto-save ) but even after turning that off, it still does it.  I was thinking of getting the newer version but I hate spending a bunch of money for some software that just doesn't work well....  I'll have to see if there is a demo to see if they corrected the issues with this version in the new one.  Must admit though it is much better in some areas than the program I had previously..."
not very user friendly
I wanted something to organize my recipes and I wanted to be able to scan my recipes that I already have written out so that I do not have to retype everything.  It is so hard to do and forget about getting support or contacting this company.  I wish I had not wasted 35 dollars.
"I have been using Kaspersky for about three years, I have not had a single problem with this product ever. Was what I expected and arrived on time."
As described
"I really love this service, especially when I am driving. About eight months ago I got an iPhone 6+ when I changed service to Sprint and subscribed to their unlimited data plan. I have more music than I can ever imagine listening to. Definitely wonderful having all these music choices for the price of the Prime membership."
"Corel Draw is the best Vector type of computer draw program.  I have used it for years and I can't wait to install it in my new computer.  I love this software program, it has always performed as expected.  Other draw programs are so complicated the the tools are not intuitive at all, Corel Draw is logically designed and once you get used to it, it is easier than any other draw program I have used."
Worse ever. They serial number was wrong and did not work. This was a gift to my mom for mother's day and it didn't work. Thanks for nothing will not buy again.
I have a Seagate 4 TB external USB 3.0 hard drive.  I ran a full backup using the Seagate software then bought and used Acronis.  It was almost twice as fast.  And subsequent backups are much faster because it apparently only backs up changes.  And that is part of the problem.  There are a LOT of options and the documentation is NOT clear and not always correct.  But it does work and is fast.  Now if I can only figure out the options and decide which one I want.
"When converting my 2005 data over to 2006 version it lost all of my time data.  I have to rebuild my datafile just to use the check register now.  Also the new program will not allow me to add a vendor or a customer.  I've had to change names and addresses of obsolete customers and vendors just to add new ones.

Intuit's support sucks and cannot seem to resolve my problems.  I have two copies on two different computers and am having the same problems with my data file on each computer.  My recommendation is if you are using the 2005 version, and don't need tax tables, don't mess with 2006 version.  It has literally cost me thousands of dollars of my time trying to work out the bugs on my own."
"I am not smart enough to be able to descern the differences in the Microsoft products and it wasn't described sufficiently i.e. there is no Outlook application in this product. After I opened it and loaded it, the missing Outlook became obvious but too late too return it. So it cost me $129 to learn that I will not buy anymore software from Amazon. I only needed the basic applications so now I have to find Outlook elseware.

"The bundled DVD software for the Whoopti Doux player I got, worked perfectly. This one didn't work. Not Retro compatible."
"I decided to make the plunge a week ago and installed Ubuntu 8.04 on a second hard drive to see how it would work. The next computer I buy will use Ubuntu (or some other version of Linux). Except for those with specialized needs, there is no longer any reason to support an expensive legacy system like Windows.

I installed Ubuntu on a four-year old eMachines PC. It was a hassle-free process, taking about 10 minutes (mostly of waiting while the computer did its thing). I was most concerned that there would be some hassle getting drivers for my wireless network adapter, but as it turned out, there was no need to worry. The adapter was recognized immediately, and I was surfing the Internet within three minutes of installing the OS.

Ubuntu comes with the software needed for everyday needs, such as a browser, a word processor and an e-mail program, plus quite a few extras, such as chat software and some simple games. The only difficulty I've had was installing some specialized software that isn't officially supported by Ubuntu, but the Ubuntu web site includes plenty of articles and forum discussions that helped me resolve the issues I had. Otherwise, installing software that's supported by Ubuntu is easier than installing software for Windows.

The interface is fairly intuitive. It's not quite the same as what Windows users are used to, but it has a much cleaner look and isn't difficult to figure out. And it's easy to customize the desktop; Microsoft seems to take the attitude that the user should adapt to do things Microsoft's way, but Linux takes the opposite approach.

The only issue I'm dealing with now is that the sleep mode creates some video instability in my computer, but I don't know if this is an Ubuntu problem or a hardware problem.

Overall, I'd highly recommend Ubuntu. A few years ago, Linux was for geeks only. But with Ubuntu and some of the other Linux packages out there, that's no longer the case. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is because there are still some web sites, such as some of those providing high-definition streaming video, that make it difficult (or officially impossible) to use anything other than Internet Explorer. Such sites are few, but they could be a dealbreaker for some users."
Call the dealer first as my Windows OS 10 would NOT let it install.
"this product runs windows better than VirtualBox or anything else.

except when i try to open certain ISO files, it won't let me open them."
"Be sure to check out your purchase.  OEM versions do not have certain features that the full versions do, such as QuickFinder, manuals, customer support and cannot be used as an upgrade. So when you are reading all the wonderful stuff on this page be sure it applies to your specific purchase."
"I had an old FTM version 4.1 on my old PC.  It was pretty easy to use, but I switched to Macs a couple of years ago and had to put the genealogy aside.  When I decided to finally get a Mac genealogy program, FTM was the obvious choice.  In retrospect, I should've gone with something else.

First, as others have noted, FTMM only imports the newer FTM formats plus GED.  I thought it would import my old FTM files - NOT!  So I exported the old file to GED format and imported them into FTM.  It looks like it imported everything, but I can't be sure.

Second, the user interface is not intuitive, at least for me.  The old version was very clear about family structures: parents were up on top, children down below.  FTMM is divided into windows and several times I've entered a list of children, only to find out later that I entered them under the wrong parent!  Moving from one individual to another is clunky, primarily because I have to pay close attention to make sure I'm moving to the right person.  Sometimes it won't let me move like I want to and I have to go to the index to select the individual.

I've had some issues with FTM locking up my Mac if I close the window without quitting the program.  Solution: quit the program EVERY TIME.  I just got a new FTMM update a day or so ago - maybe it'll solve the problem, maybe not.

About the only really good thing is that FTMM came with a 6-month subscription to Ancestry.  I'm using it while I can, but with Ancestry's outrageous prices, I won't continue when the subscription ends.  (Note to self: cancel Ancestry in June!).

For a good genealogy program for your Mac, try Reunion instead."
This is a good program if all you want to do is design a layout.  The features for placing furniture and other items is difficult to use and I just did not like it.  I did use it to design a floor plan without any problems
I could not down load this product.
"The program gets high marks from those impressed by attractive front ends. Indeed, in this class of software, such things should not be belittled; that's why I rated it as highly as I did.
I became disappointed when I looked for an object in the NGC catalog and discovered it wasn't there. As far as I can tell, for DSO's, the program delivers only the Messier objects. If I hadn't had another program (The Sky), I should not have found The Eskimo Nebula."
"Federal and State Taxes befuddle me. Too many rules, requirements and documents make filing my tax report a sitting duck for the IRS to take advantage of my lack of expertise in these financial booby traps. Turbo Tax guides me thru these financial mine fields and helps me to correctly resolve my government obligations.

Without Turbo Tax, I would probably have to pay for professional tax preparation or pay the IRS due to my lack of knowledge about their reporting requirements."
"I purchased Reader Rabbit Math ages 4-6 based on the excellent reviews listed here.  The software was so awful that I had to come back to see why everyone thought it was so great. Then I noticed under each review ""for an alternate product.""  Maybe other Reader Rabbit products are good but this one jumps from counting objects in Level One to adding three numbers on Level Two.  I would think that it would make sense to stick to 2+2 before jumping to 2+3+4 which is what this program does.  My five year old was immediately intimidated and confused by the software when she tried Level Two.  Definitely not worth the money!"
"Horrible product, crashed my computer, something very wrong with this software, do not buy this product!"
"HORRIBLE! The updated version, which is forced upon users, doesn't load. This is just bad. And don't bother trying to reinstall, rollback, or anything like that, it won't work. I don't understand how Amazon could push an update like this when it obviously hasn't been properly tested."
"I would have given 5 stars because I am happy with this. I was really happy about getting the
10GB of Cloud storage but I barely got 4.5. I could not make it change no matter what I tried. Got the item
way quicker than it said. It is really a great deal. Ok you get 5 stars.. The cloud storage would have been a bonus."
"I've had 3 copies sent to me that when installed was only good for a 30 day subscription. Who's going to pay $60 for a 30 day trial version? VIPRE was unreachable when I tried to contact them directly. Absolutely no customer service! I finally gave up and bought a different anti-virus program. Don't waste your time with VIPRE. Even if you can get a full service copy of the software. VIPRE has no customer service to back it up, you're on your own."
Great tutorial!
"This is a great software. I used it on trial and loved it. However, I checked with the developers and they told me that they will be coming out with a new version around the end of 2011, and to upgrade to the next version, you will have to buy the upgrade version of the software. That is ok, if you bought the software in 2005, but I would be disappointed if I bought the software now, and need to pay $35 to have it upgraded to the next version in a couple of months.

So, do wait a few months for the next version if you don't want to be disappointed.

Added on 17 Mar 2011:

In response to my review, EarMaster has lowered their version upgrade fee (for upgrading lower versions to EarMaster Pro 5) to $29.99 instead of $35. They also told me that it is their aim to keep the upgrade fee as low as possible."
"Proactive Protection is very hard to rate, it all good till it isn't. So far life goes on as it was."
"A lot of fun putting friends and family faces into famous pictures.  Great uses for greeting cards, posters, etc."
"It does nothing that other software, either bundled with Windows or free from Microsoft or other sources can't do.  The antivirus can be purchased stand alone if you really want it.

Norton is an unfriendly company; their customer service is not particularly helpful; their software is difficult to activate; try to reinstal it ""too many"" times because of hard disc failure and they will lock you out from activating permanently.

A one star review is appropriate."
QuickBooks was very easy to set up.  I was up and running is no time.  I now am able to send professional invoices via email and collect payments faster.  It logs all my expenses and has really made the accounting process so much easier.
"Having problems with mic that came with the unit, still working with the problem."
"My computer wouldn't load windows.  I placed this disc in the drive, powered up, and followed the instructions.  My computer now works better than before.  Outstanding!  What a relief!"
I use this product at work and at home almost every day! It is old school- but it is just what I needed!!
"Norton Internet Security 2007 load was terrible. I used the program remove tools to remove NIS 2006. The load went ok until I tried to update the virus protection. I would not update and said my subscription was expired, even though the NIS 2007 said I had 366 days left. I went to Norton tech support and loaded a patch to fix this problem but did not work. Still said my subscription was expired. On line chat went through all my t/s steps again and finally sent me a new NIS program (I think it may be NIS 2008) and this fixed my problem. I had read alot of horror stories about this s/w but figured others did not follow instructions on removal of old s/w or HW requirements. But not the case this s/w was not properly validated."
"Worked as expected.

I was pleased to see that it included FATCA (mainly the 8398) and FBAR (mainly the TD F 90-22.1) form completion - not because I'm happy to obey, rather that I'm happy to avert punishment. I was not expecting this coverage since those two groups of forms are not due on April 15 like the rest of the taxes for which I use this product. FATCA and FBAR are the relatively new requirements for all holders of non-US accounts/holdings to report exactly what you own and where it is."
"Havent got the slightest idea why iTunes does such a pathetic job of simply organising its own library but TuneUP is an absolute must for anyone who uses an iPod or phone.

Was first recommended it by one of the Geniuses in the Apple store when I mentioned that my library was a real mess. He knew exactly what was wrong and said that this program would completely fix it, which it did a bit.

Doesn't always match up your actual album art with what is on their database if there was more than one album cover but that doesn't really matter if it gives you correct album art and you didn't have it before so CHECK CAREFULLY before saving it's results.  Found over 300 CD art work and only had a problem with about 7.  Doesn't really know what to do with those 7 or with about 15 other ones with which it wasn't completely sure. But the app is great and an absolute must for anyone who rips their CDs onto their iTunes device.

It does have a problem in that when it is finding 4 covers for each separate CD in an (eg) opera, it separates each CD so you cant thereafter listen to them together. No, it doesn't know to join up multi-CD works which iTunes has separated. And (apparently) when it has put a wrong photo in as cover art, you cant then change it!!

Thus unfortunately what it can't handle is classical music, being completely baffled by the concept that Mozart, WA Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, an Evening with Mozart (which it lists under E) and Best of Mozart (which it lists under B of course) are all the same bloke, needing categorising together.  So it sprays classical music all over the library!

This software is great for every library except classical and with those libraries, it does seem to provide some improvement, although at a cost."
One of the better ones in my opinion because it seems to think for itself most of the time without bugging you about every little thing and also like the data theft protection and secure erase features and considering its good on 3 devices the price wasn't bad at all and I didn't use it since I don't have a tablet or smart phone but it seems to offer protection for those as well.
"I was very disappointed to find only 1 plan that fits what we're looking for as far as Sq. Ft. Also only one log home plan the size of an outhouse practically!! Very disappointing. Program only allows you to edit in plan view where it would be FAR  easier to do in 3D mode as then you can see what your working on and how it looks.
If you're planning on building a small home-this would be a good deal if you have the time,patience and a fast computer as that's what you need when working with program."
Works great with the Canon T3i. We had tried it with a Lumix GH2 and GH4 but they really didn't work as expected. You really want a Canon or Nikon to get a easy workflow going with this software. Very easy to set up and get right into animating.
Bought for a gift.  No problem with getting key and downloading from internet.  Had Publisher on another Pc and needed to add it to a new one.  No issues.
"I am surprised at the negative reviews.  I have been using Dreamweaver and Fireworks for a couple of years and find Fireworks very useful in creating web graphics.  Fireworks 4 is a substantial improvement over 3.  I teach DW and FW basics to colleagues where I work and find the tutorials very useful in preparing lessons.  Since I was familiar with Photoshop before I started using Fireworks, perhaps I din't notice the problems mentioned, and yes, I did use the Quickstart book and also found the tutorial in Fireworks very smooth.  It's not an easy program but it's worth learning."
no serial number provided. Can't install. Have dealt with 4 different entities so far and still no serial number.
Best internet security software out there hands down!
This software is perfect for what I needed.  It allows my to keep my books without relying on an Accountant.
Great APP
"great product, no complaints works well for what i am after.  dictation works much better than transcriptions (more accurate), so be prepared to do more proof reading and rewriting when transcribing audio, but it does the job.

one tip is to specify shipping address that is open after you get off work.  i work mon to fri 8 to 5.  they ship from 8 to 7 pm."
"I have a Dell laptop with Windows 7. The installation was quick and easy and the displays are cool. However, there were two problems that I noticed. The first is that the screen saver does not appear to be configured for a wide screen - I could clearly see the borders. Also, upon waking up, my task bar is gone and can only be brought back by restarting the computer. It was frustrating enough for me to uninstall the software."
Very easy to use
right price for all my computers
Using Windows on a Mac has never been easier!!! Easy set up and works great!!! If you need to run Windows you need this program!!!
Good antivirus software and good to be able to use on more than one device for a decent price.
It didn't work on my computer and was not able to get help to make it work. Waste of money.
"Microsoft's Accounting Professional is easy to use, easy to learn and actually does what I want it to do: keep my books and track my items.  After trying to keep my books in excel, this is like having an accountant around all the time for free.  And I tried another one which was so complicated, I ended up ebaying it.  Microsoft's Accounting program is highly recommended!"
"If you're still living in the stone age of Windows 95, then you must get Windows ME right now. The difference is virtually day and night. And for users of Windows 98 the upgrade is still helpful while at first there seems to be not that much of a difference. But Windows ME has some subtle features that I don't want to live without, like e.g. the automatic update feature that alerts you of updates and upgrades. Then there is the Windows Media Player which has excellent sound and video capabilities, which is almost a necessity in our day and age. The only difficulty we experienced so far, only occasionally though, is with the printing of E-mail notices which indicates an error message at times, but while we haven't figured out the problem yet we found a temporary solution to it. Overall, we can't give this upgrade 5 stars, because it's not as radical with super features that you may expect, but Windows ME has features you don't want to live without. Also, the operating system seems to be very stable without a freeze since installed, which wasn't the case with the previous version. It's well worth to upgrade now."
The software will not render anything over about 10 minutes.  We spent a dozen hours on support trying everything they suggested and it still failed.  As a last ditch effort we paid an additional $29.95 for phone support.  Don't waste your money on phone support - their exact words when reached by phone were to email them what the problem was - I could do that for free!
"Best free antivirus I've used, the mobile version is a must have too!"
Exceptional easy to install from the USB although you need to ensure that the computer you are installing too can boot from the USB port or device.  You can do this typically by changing the boot settings and sequence in the BIOS.  Found that it was an easier install than via a CD or DVD since in some cases the driver for the CD or DVD may not install effectively on initial boot up.
This version is SO much better than previous dragon additions.  I recommend you definitely purchase a really good microphone to use with it.  I find that it is way more accurate than previous versions I have used.  I would purchase again.  Don't think it's worth the amount you pay for it and Nuance customer service still sucks but over all good product.
Everything was Beautiful and in order. It was an Original OEM version of Windows 10 Pro. Yes the Disk did have the embossed wording ( MAID IN Puerto Rico ) Nice to see Microsoft supportive in different regions. P.s this Bought version supported all my hardware vs the free version I downloaded as a free upgrade from my paid OEM  version of Windows 8pro 
Good product
"The new 2009 Mac Pros have no firewire 400 ports, and a number of the add-in cards in the market work poorly in a Mac. This card, however, seems to work just fine. It installs in about a second and needs no drivers. Both ports become immediately available.

I've been testing mine with an iSight camera and a Lexar compactflash card reader. Given an ultra II compact flash card rated to ""minimum 9MB/second,"" I was able to copy a 1.90GB file at a pace of 9.2 MB/second. This is only about 20% the theoretical speed of a firewire 400 port, but I don't have any higher speed firewire device handy on which to apply tougher testing.

Note that the card does not support Target Disk Mode on the Mac."
"These labels tend to get caught in my printer. My printer (Canon iP4200) has a feed wheel right where the label tab is and it gets caught. This typically ruins the page.  I have resolved by applying a piece of tape in the problem area before printing.  Otherwise, the labels stick fine, I've used hundreds of them and have never heard of one coming loose or jamming up a CD or DVD player."
"This cook book looked so good.  Unfortunately I was never able to do the down loads they promised.  Following the instructions ended in a dead end.  Perhaps my incompetence is at fault.  The next disappointment was the ingredient data base.  I discovered many ingredients I commonly use were not listed.  I am now back to MasterCook9.  The final straw, there seems to be no way to contact the company for problems not listed in their help file.

Follow up 1/11/10:  I received a call from Radion Tech about my problems.  Seems my comments (see above) were the result of my ignorance.  The person who call patiently lead me through the problems.  Thanks Radion Tech."
"If I could give it 0 stars, I would.  If I could get my money back, I would.  I was forced to upgrade to Quicken 2014 when I bought a new computer.  However, Quicken 2014 requires that you register with an INTUIT ID in order to import any transactions from an online account.  In prior versions of Quicken, .ofx files could be imported into Quicken without having to go online and go directly to your bank.  This is no longer available in the 2014 version.  I would never have bought this version if I had known (I do not want to access my accounts online).  If I want to continue using Quicken 2014, I have to manually update each transaction.  As a resuit, I have switched to AceMoney, which lets me import .ofx files.  I was able to import all of my Quicken account information and transactions into AceMoney.  I would love to get a refund for this useless purchase."
"Software is as advertised and thensome.
Does everything I want it to do.
No problems with installation.
Although the software comes with help videos and instructions, I found it to be somewhat lacking for the complete capability of the software. A users manual would have been nice for suggestions, examples, etc."
I also purchased the book OFFICE 2010 SIMPLIFIED to  help me navigate the software. This has really made a difference.
"Did not work when I had to download from mcafee web site kept freezing , but I have used mcafee in the past they work great but I prefer an old fashion DVD install"
"I upgraded from Studio 7.  Having used a few different video editing software programs, Pinnacle is my favorite for editing video.  It has a relatively clean and intuitive interface.  It offers quite a few options that give you all of the flexibility to create a relatively decent video.  You will need to use other programs to help with the audio if you are going to get fancy, but that really goes for most of the other products in its price range too.
The problem has always been wrapping it up.  It always takes some kind of extraordinary process to bring the project to completion.  Your work should be done once you cut each scene to the size you want, add transitions between scenes and complete the titles.
Sometimes Pinnacle will be able to complete the project from start to finish. This is in my experience the happy exception.  Something always goes wrong, and it is never a smooth as it should be.
As an example,  my latest project is 40 minute video, I spent one weekend editing and titling the project, and the next two weekends trying to make a useful file from it.  After rendering the project for an hour or so I get a message that the program was unable to render the video.  When I finally got it to finish the MPEG-2 file, I couldn't get it to burn to the DVD.
I finally bought Ulead VideoStudio 7.  This program worked to complete the project.  I had to take the MPEG-2 file from Pinnacle and re-render it using the menus from Ulead and created a mostly successful DVD.
Previously I have used Dazzle DVD Complete to finish the project when Pinnacle wasn't up to it, but couldn't use it this time for reasons too long to go into here.  Of course Pinnacle recently bought Dazzle.  Maybe there is some hope for Pinnacle Studio 9
If you are going to get into this you are going to need a lot of patience.  If you think that you are a patient sort of person, you do not truly know until you have successfully authored your own DVD in Pinnacle."
"So many fonts to choos from, does take time to get them over to your applications but worth it!"
I had some trouble down loading it.
did not work
gud product
"I began using Dragon for Mac a few years ago in my medical practice. In recent years, I began using Dragon to type at home even though I'm a fairly good typist, because I found the Dragon made fewer mistakes.  in fact,  Dragon was so good and so fast that I used it to write a  450 page book ""common sense is not all that common him""  which was published by Amazon's create space this past July. I recently purchased Dragon for mac 5.0, which  I found to be a distinct improvement over the 4.0 version.  It seems somewhat faster and is definitely more accurate. The new interface is far easier to use than the one that appeared in the previous version. I particularly like how I can easily correct mistakes with verbal commands.
However the software does have some shortcomings, which become prominent during the editing process where the cursor tends to jump around the page spontaneously or  directions are, at times, not followed is expected.  This clearly is a serious defect, which nuance needs to correct.
 I would recommend this program to anyone who needs to type a significant amount of material  on a Mac computer because, at this point in time, there is no better software for this purpose."
"I'd been thinking of purchasing that ""really expensive photo program"" (Adobe PhotoShop) so that I could work with my photos in RAW format.

I've been using PaintShop Pro products for many years, and hated the idea of learning a whole new photo program. Paint Shop has always been quite user friendly without the need to spend hours and hours learning how to work with my photos.

I googled ""RAW format + Paint Shop Pro"" a few months ago and found this product. I'm more than happy with it and I'm glad that I don't have to spend tons of time and money learning a new system of working my photos.

I went to a photo shoot this past weekend and was able to download over 2,500 RAW format digital photos in no time!

Don't let the low price fool you - this program has a lot of capabilities. It's well worth it to try for those who especially don't have the time to take a class on how to work with PhotoShop or try to decipher the instructions in a book!"
I have used Quicken for years. Having the mobile option is great. It is really nice to be able to sync your data to your smartphone.
It doesn't slow down my computer llike Norton 360 did and i greatly appreciate that.
Just what I needed.
Awesome
Im confident tht I couldve gotten more with a pro but at $150 to get back $150 and this tie I paid $40 to get back $60. Anyway toss the numbers how you like but no audit worries and Im legit !
My computer finally had to be wiped to restore operation and when I tried it in my laptop afterwards it became a virus that locked up my laptop until removed!!! thirty bucks down the toilet!!!
somewhat disappointed in that my computer runs even slower than before.  I would not buy it if I had known the problems
Ordered this for a new computer because we were having trouble getting he MS student 365 version loaded.  Finally accomplished that task so returned this unopened package.
"Worked as advertised, arrived when it was expected, reasonable price for the products.  I would purchase again. Easy to activate code."
Great product and excellent value.  Delivered on time and works as expected.

Works as advertised.
"The download process was pretty simple, but it doesn't install on Windows 10."
"Awful customer support.  Conflicting answers with four different ""support"" personnel.  Installed QB 2016 twice.  Could not fix errors x three persons.  Finally fixed but took over FOUR hours.  Worse computer support I have ever experienced.  Lousy product"
"I bought this product for a friend in Djibouti Africa, just at a year ago. He uses it to learn other languages, encluding English. Speaking with him on the phone is now clear and email is faster. It may not be a perfect program but it will get the basics +, done in fine fashion.

"It takes an awful amount of time to go through the games, which distracts from my main objective - having a tool for my children to practice their spelling skills. What is the objective of this game? Having children practice and test their spelling skills or test their skills in shooting balls with the correct force (as in one of the games)? I will probably not use this program."
Must-have for driving in these countries.
This software is a total waste of money. It does not even deserve as star. The 3 easy steps to copy a DVD are actually 3 complicated steps
Due to price increase with turbo tax this year and problems with state returns...not to mention I am finding the business portion much harder to use and not as user friendly..this will be last year purchasing turbo tax after 30 years of using this product.
"My review echoes the conclusions of numerous reviewers in 3 regards:

1) Installation takes a long time and renders your computer unusable while it is in process. My laptop was grinding away so loudly and got so hot that I had a huge regret that I hadn't backed up my files before starting the installation. I really thought that I was going to have a hard drive meltdown. My laptop is just 1 year old and does meet the minimum recommended requirements for this s/w. Startup of the software also takes a long time - probably about a minute. When you run it for the first time it finds and imports all applicable images, movies and audio files which also takes a very long time.

2) There is absolutely no help file or quick start guide. If you want help you have to pay for it. I've been a user of Microsoft and Adobe and other complex software products for decades and rely constantly on various on-line learning resources to become competent with those products. This condition will leave many potential users cold. The best way to ensure customer loyalty is to make sure that they can easily adopt and learn to love the products, and Corel has missed the mark here. The fact that support is a paid service is not evident in the marketing materials.

3) The user interface, while it seems to be similar to other video editing products, is not at all intuitive so a quick-start guide or high level overview would go a long way to getting the user to complete a first project. I tried several times to figure out the basics and abandoned each project in frustration. I have found some Youtube videos which should help, particularly this one:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlcFqL0uT3M

The software does seem to have the features and functions necessary to produce a comprehensive video, and I will be spending more time with it to try to crack the code; however I will not be paying for the user support that should be offered for free.

I had looked forward to the arrival of the Pinnacle Studio 18 software so that I could finally put together videos of still and video images from some of my recent trips and post them to YouTube. I now see that realizing that goal is going to take a considerable investment of time and a steep learning curve."
This is freedom. It lets you write without worrying - or even thinking - about format.
Didn't know this doesn't include business or for self employed compared to last year when I just used the deluxe version. What a scam!
Had to upgrade from XP to Windows 7.  The DVD arrived quickly and was installed with little problem.  From others experiences I did not want Windows 8. Ugh!
"Used to be free, I know it's only 0.01 but it's the principle. Otherwise a good cheap replacement for someone who can't afford to buy microsoft office for their mac"
"I can always find what I want, no matter what decade I choose. Love my Amazon playlists which I can customize for my mood!"
"Just don't make the same mistake I did - only 2 of these Arthur games actually support NT/2000/XP. So unless you have the archaic 95/98 OS, fuhgedaboutit. Pity, because our son loves to play these at our local library."
Have used in past -- it works -- minimal overhead
Getting better every year...I have been using them for about 10 years now and have never had any issues and its easy to get answers to your questions.
Did not work for me. I installed it on my two PCs but  firefox browser opens so many popup windows  even I could not work on internet. Although McAfee shows up and running fine but it is not detecting and removing the malware!
"This product, while a bit expensive, is very much worth the money for the many services it delivers in a seamless way.  I can do many things with my .Mac account with just a few clicks that are frankly quite amazing.  If you have the money and own a Mac, definitely buy this service."
dd not work - sent it back for refund
Can't get it to open on my computer.
This software has saved a great deal of time and is easy to use even on difficult tax issues.
"I have used this product in the past and find it has everything that I personally need to produce marketing materials.  Someone who is more knowledgable may or may not agree, but I've always gotten compliments from those that I am marketing to.  I have since changed jobs and have purchased this item to use at the new company.

My feeling at this point is that Nova Development is seriousely customer service challenged.  I needed this product to produce some materials for an upcoming presentation and had ordered it with plenty of time to spare.
I was installing it and had a glitch when at the prompt I inserted disc 2.  Upon calling tech support and working through the installation they had informed me that the disc was corrupted and they'd send a replacement.  The disc arrived about 10 days later (still in plenty of time for my presentation).  Well, this disc gave the same results upon inserting it.  I worked through the process again with tech support and they informed me that this disc is also corrupt and they'd send me a new one.  I asked that they please test the disc first and they said they would.  They did, however, refuse to overnight it as they did not have that decision making capability.  I asked to be kicked upstairs to have the conversation with a decision maker.  You'd think I'd asked them if they thought the moon were really made of cheese.  I could sense the dumbfoundedness through the phoneline.

Now, 2 weeks later I still do not have this disc.  I contacted customer service and tech support and they have no record of our conversation concerning the second disc or if it was ever shipped out.  I offered to forward them the confimation E-mails that came from them but they did not want me to (???????).

I have since contacted [...] (the original seller).  They informed me to deal only with their tech support as the manufacturers tech support features mostly slackjaws reading from manuals.  To this I can certainly attest.  I am presently awaiting contact from the sellers tech support team.  BTW, the presentation went well but, in my opinion, could have been much splashier and professional."
"85% of the reviews for this FREE app are 1-star reviews. I think I know why. It seems to be an simple, easy-to-use app, but don't be so foolish as to think that you will ever be able to get any kind of help when you need it. My experience on three requests for help has been as follows: They answered the first one, but with kind of a surly and completely unhelpful attitude. They didn't even answer the other two. Too bad. I was beginning to really like the app when I ran into some problems that they couldn't or wouldn't help me with."
"Does not work well and help menus poorly written and not helpful. I would like to return MS2013 and try MSSuite 2010. I have had many years of experience with computer software but nothing as bad as this. If possible, I would like to delete 2013 and download 2010 Suite at no extra cost. What say you?

"And does the job!  I have used Turbo Tax AND gone to a CPA before and the Turbo Tax was spot on!  So now I just use it!  Wish it e-filed the State too, but at least it did it and I could mail.  E-filed the Fed!

Easy to download, easy to use and easy to file!  Have used for several years and will keep using!"
"Great program, I liked it so much I upgraded to the Architecture version and they subtracted the amount I paid for my Interiors version too!"

"Look out if you are running Windows 10. This product failed to install on any of my three pcs running Win 10 and they all gave the error message 'Your app doesn't work with Windows 10.'  The Amazon download site says it does work with Windows 10, but it appears the ZoneAlarm website doesn't have any information about this product. The only products there are the 2017 versions. And the returns center on Amazon says there can be no returns or refunds for software."
It's awful!  I wish I hadn't upgraded from the older version. It has tons of bugs and glitches that have yet to be fixed. I can't download transactions from BofA anymore without the program crashing so I have to enter everything MANUALLY. It also crashes during other functions and it runs REALLY SLOW compared to the previous version. Don't waste your time and money on it until they get their issues with it resolved. This really could have been avoided if it had been properly tested before launch.
Seems to work pretty well no issues
"I really wanted to like this, but I was not happy with it at all. I am used to using microsoft office at previous jobs, and wanted to find something similar for cheaper or, in this case it was free. I know a lot of people want word documents, and i was like okay great this should do the trick, even if it's not microsoft office. It wasn't letting me create things, it was overall just a really strange setup. I could only save it for some reason under libre office's format, which i couldn't open in microsoft, or any other program for that matter. I uninstalled it."
The best marketing software around.
I trust Norton.
Liked
"I don't think was what I had in mind for my businesses. Too clunky, not intuitive enough, and not the options I wanted."
"There's a learning curve, but it worked pretty dang good straight from the start, and I use it for writing psych/social work papers from school. It understood some complex words, but I did have to train it for words like biopsychosocial or psychoanalytical. It saves me TONS of time on papers and process recordings, and I look forward to using it for more email."
McaFee Total Protection is the best ever security that 've used. You get warn just before entering an unsecure site. Updates every time you power on your PC. I've been using McAfee for five years now and Ilike the extra feature then comes with the product. I used the web all the time and I recomend this product for all online activities. You gonna love the security if You buy this product. thank you McAfee.
"I have used Kaspersky for years, great program, not too much of a drag on performance, has not let me down yet!"
"Even after installing this software, my 'old software"" still pops up indicating I have several drivers out of date.  Not really sure about this one."
Calendar maker was a little disappointing. I found it difficult to use and did not offer many style options. Would not recommend this product.
"If you are a mid-sized company that can afford a ""multi-user version"" with ""support plan"" then Sage 50 is excellent software.  But the ""mom and pop shop"" watching every dime they spend is out of luck with the newer versions of Sage 50.  For them I recommend going on ebay or amazon and getting an older version (before 2013) so that they can do their accounting and payroll forever without buying new software every year.  Don't blame the Sage company.  They are faced with the realities of the software business.  There is no longer any money in selling a program that can be used forever without updating.  Oh...and whatever you do...stay away from Quick books which has many technical problems in its database and is organized in the most confusing, illogical way."
DOWNLOADED GREAT
"I was using PowerDirector 12, and upgraded to PowerDirector 13.  It was a mistake.  The program, in general, has always had a lack of polish, including redraw problems (where all the UI interface elements disappear after completing an action), counter-intuitive interface design, random crashes, and weird bugs (occasionally all transitions in a project will suddenly switch which element is A and which is B, and many others).  Those are all still present; in fact, the UI has managed to take a step backwards, never remembering window positions and sizes, and the redraw is even worse than before.  Now, however, there is a bug where any AVI file imported will rotate the image 90 degrees, while leaving the image frame not rotated, so everything looks like it was taken on a vertical camera phone, but is also rotated the wrong direction.  Contacting support resulted in a series of form-letter responses with occasional bits of unhelpful advice.  And to actually talk to a live human is 30 dollars for 2 months of phone support.  No official response on their forum after multiple people posted about the bug over a few weeks.  I strongly advise against purchasing this program."
"PLI product is in great condition. All parts are contained in the package.  Workbooks had no markings, as advertised and the CDs/DVDs seem to b unused, as advertised. Very accurat representation of the product.

WorldSales - got backed up in its shipping Department, but, upon inquiry frolm me, was able to resolve the issue quickly. They subsequently refunded the SHipping costs that I had already paid due to their delay. I would feel comfrtable purchasing from WOrldSales again."
"Very poor service and support.  I have followed through with 3 emails and a promise from the CEO that I would receive support.  Words and promises are easily given, only solutions and actions count.  As to date this company makes promises,but doesn't back them up. Rated product a 1 star.

FOLLOW-UP  12/5/13  Got a reply from company that support was slow due to holidays.  I was sent a new download link and all the problems I was having with version 10 has been fixed.  I captured 5 internet recipes, added two more titled cookbooks, all within less than an hour.  I haven't used the exchange yet, but look forward to trying that feature and the mobile apps within the week.

Purchased a new computer and so I needed Office software.  This was an old favorite and familiar.  2013 version meets all those needs for me. I got use to the few differences from older versions rather quickly. Relatively intuitive.
"I bounced around several photo software packages.  I own Photoshop CS3, Photoshop Elements, Photoshop Bridge,Paintshop Pro, Aftershot pro, Photoscape, Gimp and Faststone.  As you can see I had difficulty settling.  I was using different software for specific functions.  I was frustrated.  Zoner came along and this is by far the closest I can get to a single application satisfying my requirements.  When one adds the free Adobe lens and camera profile plugin the package is complete and very effective.  I give it 6 stars."
"After using the Magix Pro series for the past 3 years, I had an opportunity to run some competing video editors, including Sony Vegas and Cyberdirector, to see if there would be any rendering advantages in other software formats. I discovered that the nomenclature of most video software these days is so different between programs, that it requires a complete retraining of processes in order to get results, which I found myself unwilling to do. The 'comfort' of the Magix interface, coupled with a good book-sized publication included in the package, made it a compelling choice for me to decide upon acquiring MX Pro 18. While its rendering times are not the fastest in the industry, the amount of video and audio tools included in the package (audio recordists take note, this is as good as Pro Tools for a computer multitrack solution!) make the program one of the most powerful in its price range."
"The game frequently crashes and on this particular disc, several anomations and cut-scenes were missing (a significant amount, actually) and it's a good condition disk so I don't believe this problem comes from damages."
"Before you order this, go to the Chief Architect website and download it for free.  Then decide. Everybody raived about the tutorial.  It won't let you use it unless you have a password, but does not tell you how to get a password.  Then to download the objects to place in your drawings takes eight hours and it is quirkey.  It is Punch/Broaderbund for me, despite what others say."
"Terrible product.  I don't think I will be allowed to tell all that  happened, but stay away from any of their products. Took me hours to undo the unwanted changes  they made to my computer.."
Everything is okay
Good place for photos
Used it for years now and really like it. Haven't lost any data since I switched to it. The pop ups  from it are frequent but it's a small annoyance since the program is free.
"I've been using windows 8.1 for approx a month now. When I first replaced my on pc, which used XP, I was not happy.
After using 8.1 for awhile, I've come to like it very much. You'll see it's designed for use with a touch screen but
you just need to think of your mouse as an extension of your finger, to swipe etc. There are many more good things
about it than things not to like. My wife has windows 7 and I don't like that nearly as well as 8.1
I started using computers way back on a radio shack trash 80 for those of you old enough to remember.
Things have come a long way."
"Great deal, always look for these on Amazon.com"
"Installed the Amazon Software Downloader and Taxcut 2008 software, applied updates and was working on my taxes within one hour. Whatever issues that did occur with the Downloader, Amazon must have corrected.

The only negative is the Amazon Software Donwloader stays resident in memory unless you change the setting. Of course, you can always un-install the software and re-install when making future purchase."
"I like the music for the most part, but it won't always play through my car's Bluetooth. I have to restart my phone every time to get it to play. It will say it is connected and playing through my car, it says the song is playing, but there is no sound in my speakers or my phone. I don't know what the problem is but it is really irritating. I have an Iphone 5s.

And also, how do you not have Metallica. Really?"
There is no software that could compare to QuickBooks. I would never use anything else. I recommend QuickBooks to every business owner I know.
"EuroTalk's Learn Lithuanian is a well thought out system for beginners who want to learn the Lithuanian

language. It's simple to use, fun and before you know it, you are learning !!! Also at a very good price !!!  I am very glad I bought this and would recommend it to all who

are looking for a genuine great deal !"
"Can not restart bidding

I have been using Quicken for 13 years. I don't know how I kept my checkbook balanced before becoming a Quicken user. I've also faithfully upgraded to each new revision so I can discover the new methods included to make things easier than before. I export data to my Income Tax program and create several reports to keep an eye on my spending habits. Quicken is the BEST!

"Most movie making software at this point is very similar.  It's very hard to distinguish one from the other.  If you've ever used Movie Maker, iMovie or Final Cut, then you get the idea.  Sequential ordering of movies, photos and images with fancy transitions.  You lay an audio track and compile a video file.  The whole process is pretty simple.  Apple's Final Cut is safe to say the gold standard for consumer level movie editing. But for those of us in the Windows ecosystem, Windows Movie Maker is probably the most oft used application.  Makes sense seeing that it's free.  By default, it's installed with Windows 7.  If you run Windows 8, you have to download it from Microsoft.

But like the girl in the AT&T commercial, I want more.  I primarily use VideoStudio to edit my Contour videos.  If you aren't familiar with Contour, it's a wide angle camera much like the GoPro that is used primarily to film action sports.  I use it to film myself skiing and mountain biking.  The Pro X6 software really lends itself well to editing high action footage.  Point and area tracking is so easy that I didn't even have to break open a manual.  The software is very intuitive and fun to play with.

I have no delusions of grandeur.  My movies won't remind you of Kubrick or Capra.  I just want a simple piece of software with some powerful tools that are quick and easy to implement.  Corel's VS Pro X6 meets my wants.  I wouldn't consider this a ""pro"" software as the name suggests, but it's good enough for some Youtube videos and for sharing with friends and family.

I didn't get to play around with the 4k resolution settings, but I guess it can't hurt to have this feature for future-proofing.  If I do get a camera that films in 4k resolution, I will return and update this review."
"I was using qb 2011 and just upgraded to 2014.  Love all the new features and Intuit has fixed some of the little issues that was a pain to use.  Also, I love love love the scan and attach; I use it everyday."
"I was looking for a GPS system for my convertible Miata.

The Microsoft Streets and Trips 2005 with GPS Locator is probably the best GPS system for 75$.

Any other GPS products (Garwin, Copilot, Palm, just to name a few) have very tiny screen,  don't have a keyboard (except the palm) and are much more expensive.

The Microsoft Streets and Trips 2005 with GPS Locator require a laptop which mean you can type in and modify your route anytime you want on the go... no need to do it at home or upload anything.

I use The Microsoft Streets and Trips 2005 with GPS Locator on a very old laptop ( a thinkpad Iseries 1400 bought in 2001, with windows 98, 64 MB ram and USB 1.1) and it works. Ofcourse the better is your notebook the better. But if you worry about system requirement, S&T 2005 will work with a 2001+ notebook..

The notebook is plugged into a 450 watts car power inverter which convert the electricity coming from the car lighter.

Becareful to choose the right Power Inverter.  See your notebook AC/DC powerbar.  If your Power Inverter is too low, your notebook may shutdown by it self.

Dont relay on your notebook internal battery either, you will drain your notebook battery too rapidely. You must use a power inverter.

You can buy these anywhere like Radioshack or any big car accessory retailers for around 50 bucks.

Installing the software.

Installation was easy, but make sure you do the Full install not the minimum. The minium install require that you leave one CD in the CD-Rom drive which is bad if your CD-Rom has auto shutdown energy saving feature...

Do the full install, require about 1 GB HD space.

Starting the software

It is true, when you start the software for the first time, sometime the GPS takes like 10 minutes to initialize (locate your position) and other time it takes only 10 seconds to locate.

Once your location shows on the map, your car should appear, and it refresh in real-time. (like a car racing video game) you will be able to see your car moving on the map in real-time as you move.

The downsides.

The downsides are:

1- No voice signal, Streets and Trips 2005 don't tell you when to turn. But then again, with Voice, it may require a more powerful notebook.

2- It runs on a Notebook, and notebook are kinda heavy and big to carry arround.

3- Its dangerous !!!!!!

  Do not look at your computer screen when you drive !!!! im not kinding !, Streets and Trips 2005 will not warn you if you're about to smash into another car !!!.

You should get a real copilot so he/she can hold the notebook and read the map for you. But DO NOT LOOK AT YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN WHEN YOU DRIVE. IT IS EXTREMLY DANGEROUS, for you, for your car, for your passengers and for everyone on the road.

I repeat, do not look at your computer screen when you drive.

Do you hear me ???

Anyway,

Do i recommand Street and Trips with GPS, for 75$ absolutely !"
"This is a very capable suite of software. Expression Web 4 is the equal to (and in many ways superior to) Dreamweaver.

But Microsoft has decided to concentrate on the Visual Studio line, and in Dec. 2012 they made these programs available for free download--full programs, not trial versions. The only downside is that there's no tech support for the free versions; there is paid support--not free--for the retail versions."
"Ever since Microsoft dropped out of the race, Quicken is one of the few programs around at a reasonable price.

I had one of the earlier versions and I was told by Quicken customer service that version did not support Windows 8.
Not clear from talking with Quicken if the newest version supports Windows 8.1."
"This was one of the best investment that I had after getting a Macbook. It allowed me to switch seamlessly without the computer crashing. Plus, it is as fast as I hoped it would be giving it a feel of efficiency."
"UPDATE 5/1/2014: In April 2014, after upgrading to 8.1 my laptop's WiFi adapter mysteriously began failing. It seems the WiFi is now physically broken, though laptop WiFi cards do wear out naturally. Anyhow, I've wiped Windows 8, and now I'm back on Windows 7. My new USB WiFi adaptor from Amazon is working like a charm. For those still on Win 8 / Win 8.1 Microsoft seems to be listening to their customers a bit more lately. Let's keep our fingers crossed for Win 9.

UPDATE 3/22/2013: The only thing more deplorable to me than Windows 8 right now is the fact that Microsoft still has not addressed Win8's primary problems after being on the market for this long. To me this represents the demise of an important USA-based technology company. What we are seeing here is the abandonment of any sense of care for what customers actually want. Microsoft is forging ahead cavalier-style while leaving a huge trail of blood in its wake. (This is exactly what Electronic Arts is currently doing with SimCity, the biggest video game failure in computer history). To ignore the needs of customers is the single biggest mistake a technology company can make. If I could downgrade my Win8's review score to a negative value I would.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: When Windows 7 came out my faith in Microsoft increased. This time around Microsoft has let me down considerably. This one star review is about what a mistake Microsoft is making with this release of Windows. Starting with 5 stars Windows 8 is fast under the hood and is optimized for modern tablet-like devices. Compatibility issues are few but do exist. Windows 8 boots faster and has some performance improvements so I'm sure many power users will go for it. The kinks, which I am about to explain, will be relieved over time by either Microsoft themselves or 3rd party help. So what happened? Why is it that Windows 8 will probably be OK for IT geniuses, and a confusing mess for everyone else?

To me this isn't even an OS upgrade, and it shouldn't be. Microsoft has replaced their beloved Start menu with a full screen box-style UI optimized for tablets. I'd consider this a good idea for an app that can live on top of Windows 7. This is by no means a reason to release a new version of Windows. 3rd party Start menus exist for Windows 8 so you can unbreak this mistake. What does this do for the millions of people who have learned how to use the Microsoft Windows operating system? Why, it simply alienates them and makes them unable to use their computer. Maybe a good time to switch to Mac! What does this do for Enterprise? Nothing! Nothing but annoy IT efforts and cause costly re-training issues. I'm not sure a bigger blunder is even possible.

And the new UI itself? Ugly. Functionality issues? Plenty. In Windows 7 you can just press the Start button on the keyboard and type a question; Windows figures it out. Not in Windows 8. You must choose a different ""Search"" mode, making Windows 8 clearly dumber and more cumbersome than the OS before it. Want to launch the App pinned to the leftmost spot on the taskbar? Whoops--that invisible Windows 8 Start box and sends you to the Metro Start Menu Of Doom--an ugly marketing driven zone where Microsoft hopes you buy into their bowl of punch and Microsoft-centric apps. This OS would sooner fool you into using a Microsoft app you've never heard of then guide you through the process of setting up your existing services on new tiles. I'm not drinking the punch.

And try turning off your computer? Umm.. Hello? Bill? Who approved this OS be released? Knock knock. Who's there? Bill. Bill who? Bill ya $15 and you won't be able to turn your computer off. (The button is there...somewhere)

I only wasted the $15 to learn more about this mistake and be on the cutting edge of... being an idiot and spending $15 I don't need to spend? I guess. Apparently it's faster, so all hope is not lost. So there ya go, one star for speed! Finally, who is in charge over there at Microsoft? I'm fairly certain 8th graders could design a cooler OS.

Update 11/10/12: The title of this update is ""No apps match your search."" I am still quite annoyed by having installed Windows 8 on my laptop. The error ""No apps match your search."" is what Windows 8 gives you when you click the Start button and type ""device manager"". The new Start menu is absolutely ugly and difficult to navigate when compared to the previous Windows Start menu. This remains an unacceptable mistake. When Microsoft patches Windows 8 to solve problems like this I will update this review.

Update 12/20/12: Windows 8 still has not been fixed and remains one of the worst operating systems I have ever used. I just tried to download and open a "".doc"" file from my email--an experience so frustrating I had to come here to write this update. Windows 8 does not recognize Microsoft's very own doc format and is asking me to ""Look for an app in the Store"" in order to open a "".doc"" file! This is absolutely insane. Clicking that link goes to a page that suggests 15 possible apps I can download or purchase to open the "".doc"" file, and Microsoft Office isn't even on the list! Microsoft please stop ruining people's computers--I beg you."
"I installed this product on a new HP laptop running Windows 8.1.  I have been using Quicken 2010 Starter Edition on my HP desktop. and after copying all my files to the laptop, my 2010 register data transferred without a problem.  The user interface is slightly different, but no big deal.  If you only use the Quicken basic functions, the starter edition will be more than adequate."

Match one-Intercontinental Championship-Y2J Vs Shelton Benjamin(C. Very good match with the possible outcome of a Y2J heel turn. This was a great way to start of this show. My rating 6/10.

Match Two-Tag Team Turmoil For the Tag Team Championships-William Regal&Tajiri(C) Vs The Heartthrobs Vs Maven&Simon Dean Vs La Resistance Vs Hurricane&Rosey. Very quick by most tag team turmoil matches. It had a very good ending and it surprised alot of people. The right team won in the end. Good match to continue a good show. My rating 6.5/10.

Match Three-Last Man Standing Match-Chris Benoit Vs Edge. These two have had many fine matches in the past and this was no exception. It has lots of high spots and bumps. The ending in my opinion was a little overboard but a great match none the less. My rating 8/10.

The Percentage of this event in total was

Match Four-Kane Vs Viscera. This was basically just a filler match. It was two big mean brawling then Kane chokeslamming for the win. After the match after Viscera's heel push. He SPLASHED Trish Stratus on the ground after looking for the audiences approval. I guess Viscera turned face after turning heel to Put Trish out while she recovers from injury. My rating 5/10.

Match Five-""Hollywood"" Hulk Hogan&""HBK""Shawn Michaels Vs Muhammad Hassan&Khosrow Daivari. This the return match of Hogan versing the Arab Americans. This match very back and forth with Major pops for Hogan. This was a great match and it was well places on the card. My rating 7.4/10.

Match Six-Main Event-World Heavyweight Championship-Rematch of Wrestlemania XXI-Batista(C)Vs HHH.This was very back and forth. HHH who had vowed to hit the pedigree to end Batista executed the pedigree with no ref to count. Great match to end a great event. My rating 7.65/10.

The overall percent of this event is 67.58% which equates to a B which i believe is very fair to this show which was one of the better PPV's After Wrestlemania."
It worked!!!
"We bought this to help our daughter to prepare for the SAT test. She was anxious about not having enough time to complete each section. We went through the software with here and were impressed. The Flash cards are a great asset but the timed practise tests really do an excellent job of preparation. More important than everything else she got from this software, was her confidence. She went in to her test prepared, calm and confident and did great thanks in large part to this software program. We've recommended it to several friends and know how much help it can provide."
"Bought for my grandpa so he could use his laptop better. He just can't type on a keyboard. This is his first time ever being on a computer. He's needing to learn the lingo, but the product works great and we are happy with it."
"Norton discontinued the product a month after the purchase. They described a process whereby a partial refund would be made, but I haven't seen it 8 weeks later."
I don't understand why make changes if others are fine . Go back to windows 7 or wait for a better upgrade
One DVD was omitted from the packaging.
"I have tried and tried to get this product to operate correctly. No matter the setting I choose, it is either too strict or too permissive. I've tried using both a self created list and the one provided by Net Nanny. I cannot get either to work right. I am very frustrated by it and have been forced to uninstall it three times in order to access my homepage (ESPN.com). If you have more patience, maybe your result will be different, but I cannot recommend this product."
"Try it few times before my decision to return it, and did not like it.
I feel I can do better resume if I sit with the Word."
"I used this product for years, never a problem. I always received emails when it was time to renew.
If you follow the instructions you should have no problems."
excellent!
Very good and very easy to use.
"Don't use it for cell phone streaming because it uses 10x the data of Spotify or Pandora, but I'm never buying a CD again.  Amazon music is excellent for buying, saving and downloading."
"worked for 6 months then crashed, tried to reinstall product and it won't install at all tried all possible fixes with no success stuck with worthless cd, what a ripoff  !!!!!!!!! windows 10 pro X64, DON'T buy this ripoff...."
"I had an earlier version of the Bible library that I liked very much. I recently got a new laptop with windows 7 as the operating system. The old program would not load onto the machine so I bought a newer version. It will not work with 7 either. I tried to contact customer support but so far no help from them. The Bible Library works great. You can go from book to book easy and you just click on the verses. It has very good referance books that are easy to use,but not if you have windows 7."
"Worst version yet. Don't waste your money. Constantly crashing, won't download or worse wants you to identify accounts you have been using for 20 years. I spend more time screaming at my monitor than getting my data entered."
It wasn't what I wanted but it was full of good information and I will tell my friends about it.
it works. others i've tried don't. so good stuff.
"HR Block misrepresented this product.

The state function did not work - all that was provided was pdf displays of the state forms that we could have just found online ourselves, with no step instructions, no entry procedures at all.  Federal process was tolerable.  However, state isn't included, despite the package labels.

Secondly, the package does NOT give you e-file instructions, despite being advertised as such.  Not even instructions, much less the actual e-filing promised."
"just like OFFICE, and its free"
"I received Norton Anti-Virus 2003 Professional Edition as a Christmas gift.  I have loaded and removed it at least five times.  I have followed every suggestion offered at the Symantec website ""Knowledge Base"" to solve my problem which is error messages on bootup and ""cannot start Norton Anti Virus after startup"".  The instructions were complicated (thank God I have some experience with PCs)
After very carefully following each step suggested, at the end of multiple reboots and respective removal and reinstallation of the software, I found myself back at the beginning with the same alert message and the same problem of not being able to start the program.  I think I will return the product to the giver and go back to McAfee which didn't give me any problems for the last six years."
"This was a great buy, was able to upgrade all of our computers to the newer edition which is very secure. the Network protection works a little too good, I had to remove Symantec and then reinstall only the Basic Symantec on a couple computers that run a shared program, like servers."
"Have used Picture it for years and loved every version a little more with each version, until now.  The Picture It Photo Premium in high tech terms [is bad].  Looks good, installs well. But it lacks a lot of the standard flexiblity in previous versions.  I was expecting a lot more and got a lot less!!!"
"I've been a user of MS FrontPage vX.X for several years now, and until now, thought it was the best WYSIWYG editor.  I am by all means not a expert at designing web pages, and I don't have time to learn all the in's  and out's of HTML.  Considering this, I look for the easiest, and most  professional web authoring tool that is easy to deploy, setup, and publish  with.  Best of all, Fusions HTML output works on ANY web server, so there  are no FP extensions needed here for functionality.  With the ability to  utilize many professional templates, and integrate your own HTML should you  wish, it is very robust.  I would advise this for the very basic beginner,  all the way up to the most proficient of programmers."
It was pretty good. Not sure if going to use TurboTax or this next year. Close to the same as far as ease of use... but TurboTax felt a little smoother.
"I love this! I have been a Mac convert and even though I ""never wanted to look back,"" I still did because Apple's iWork (Pages and Keynote) were not my cup of tea and were heavily limited. MS Office for Mac was the answer to my prayers! I grew up using MS Office and I haven't found a better word processing/computing programs than these. MS Word, Excel, PPT, and Entourage completed my school computing needs while I enjoy the reliability and hassle-free use of my Mac. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

I had my cake and ate it too."
"I decided to get Microsoft home and office because I needed an upgrade for my pc. I currently had WordPerfect. (Which I could not stand!) This program helped me with my paper assignments, powerpoint and excel sheets that I needed for both school and work. Another benefit was that this program also spell checks in other languages, which is a big plus for me since I write papers in Spanish. (the spell checker picks up the accents that some words require). This program is very user friendly and has many tools to help make charts and graphs, even if it is your first time doing them on a computer. I would definetly recommend to others!"
It was an absolute terrible product! It requires Quicktime to run which is dumb. After I installed Quicktimes all I could do was listen to vocabulary. The games are all a bunch of card games that don't help reinforce anything. DON'T BUY THIS
Is all good
"This is what happens when you get a Mac, but your wife still wants to do all the same things she did on a Windows PC.

works as expected."
It's Norton; top of the line!
It works well Windows 10.  The transition from QuickBooks 2014 was an easy move.
"I have read several reviews regarding the additional filing fees associated with a state tax return.  With this particular version of TurboTax the federal tax return can be e-filed for free and the state tax return can be e-filed for an additional $19.95 fee.  When setting up the e-file information you have the choice of having the $19.95 state e-filing fee deducted from your return or paid with a credit card.  If you choose to have the fee deducted from your return you are charged an additional $29.95 for using that particular feature.  If you choose to pay the state e-filing fee with a credit card you are not charged an additional $29.95.

Intuit should have described the fees and circumstances under which they are charged more clearly.  Other than that, I love TurboTax and have been using it for over a decade now."
Latest version is consistent with my prior experiences.  Quicken has always been good.  Just upgraded to get the latest version.
Very good!
"I own a video production company named VIDEO EXPERTS in East Windsor, CT and I've been a Quickbooks user since 1996 and it keeps getting better every year."
I bought this WordPerfect X5 recently.  It was reasonably priced.  It was easy and quick to install and works great
"I have had such a problem with this software. I am a hardened FP user since 1991 when I started with the paper based system. It's an awesome technique and concept. Unfortunately, their software implementation has never been a good one (I've used previous generations of their software before moving to the XP version). I NEVER write product reviews for anything. But the problems with this product have plagued me for sooo long that I feel compelled to write and hopefully help someone else not get into this mess.
My experience has been good with tech support. They have supported the problems I've had. Unfortunately the product is not stable. I still get crashes where it disappears altogether (although it does come back...). I still have problems with hotsync. I had it working with tech support's great help, but ANYTIME you change a single thing the whole thing falls apart. I had to upgrade laptops at work (how I use it....), and on the new laptop I've yet to get it sync'ing.
I'm desperate for an alternate product from them - hopefully they will dump this and bring something else online.
Hope this helps someone out there...."
"I have been an avid quicken user for over a decade. With each new upgrade, there are always some growing pains and a learning curve. But, with this newest edition and the mobile app, even after owning the product for 2 months I am still having issues with the desktop version. And the mobile app is useless. The main problem I am having with the desktop version is it's failure to download transactions from my bank. I have several accounts at one bank, and the program fails to communicate with this bank to download transactions. One day it will be working just fine, and the next, the program thinks that this account isn't at the bank and suggests I remove it from one-step update. I have deactivated and reactivated one-step update so many times, it is almost comical.

Now for the mobile app. Useless. Waste of disk space. The mobile app doesn't do anything I need it to do. First of all it gives only gives you your online balance (which I can get more quickly from my own bank's app) or your ending balance. Not what your balance is today. (For example, I enter all my bills into my register at the beginning of the month, dated to the day they actually get paid, so they are technically, ""pending"" transactions. This way, I can see if I am going to run out of cash before the next pay day.) The mobile app doesn't give you your balance on any given day, and it doesn't give you your daily balance like it does on the desktop version. The other issue, is it's failure to allow you to edit a split transaction if it was entered on the desktop. You can't transfer money between accounts on the mobile version. If you enter a transaction in the mobile app, the desktop version treats it as a downloaded transaction from a bank. Then, when you try to reconcile, you have to unclear the transaction in order for it to balance.

Don't waste your money, stay with the older version until they fix this fiasco."
"I make slideshows to put on DVDs for family, and this was fine.  I really miss the items that use to come with big fat books on how to use it.  The help is okay just like everything else but sometimes you have to search for a while to find an answer.  I have been using Roxio and this this one better, although I still use MY DVD from Roxio to make the DVD menu which is easier and has more menu templates.  I glad I can switch back and forth.  Good product, easy to use, came on time, but now I am thinking should have bought the more expensive one.  Getting your stuff on Face book and You Tube is really easy, like that.  All in all I am happy."
"Adequate product , I have used both this and competitor products and find this is good but not really better than the less expensive competitor products like TurboTax."
"I switched from turboTax because HRBlock was cheaper and offered the Amazon tax return gift card.  Not only is this software a clunky mess straight out of some grad student's dorm room, they charge you once to prepare a state return then an additional $20 to e-file it."
"We bought the 3-pc McAfee suite earlier this year but then recently got a new PC for guests. One of the guests managed to get the pesky redirect bug.  The Panda Complete package seems to be just as effective at containing that problem as the McAfee. A few of the features are slightly easier to use on McAfee because the GUI seems just a hair more intuitive. However, for the price, Panda is a really good low resource security suite. I have had zero problems with guests PC.  :-)"
I didn't even get to download it. I didn't find the page that allows me to redeem the code. I want a refund.
"When PartitionMagic was produced by Powerquest, it was a great product. We used it all the time at work. But, ever since Norton took it over, it is not  the same. I cannot get it to work on a drive with partitions orginally created by the MS operating system (XP Pro in this case). It knows they are there, but it will not work with them. It wants a total reinitialization of the drive. I switched to Acronis Disk Director which does the same stuff for less money, and it works with existing partitions!

I cannot recommend Norton's PartitionMagic. It may work if you are building a totally new drive, but it won't work with an existing drive. I returned it and bought Acronis. I am much happier now."
"Overall, this is a nice product. It's not much different from the previous versions. It has a slicker look and the toolbars have been broken out to various parts of the screen. It will take you a minute to get acustomed to looking for sub-categories on the main screen verses rolled up along the top. There are some good things that I like. It allows you to split a transaction in the chart of accounts without opening the transaction line item. Although ,the trade off is that to open the line item transaction you no longer double click you have to highlight it and click on edit transaction.

Really you're upgrading not becuase its a better product but becuase Intuit will no longer support or provide online backing for previous versions 2010 or older. If you need online banking then welcome to QuickBooks 2013. If not, it's not necessarily worth the extra $350 bucks. I will say that the price found here on Amazon is the best price going. It's about $100 cheaper than newgg.com and over $200 directly from Intuit."
"My husband has difficulty conjugated his verbs correctly.  He has greatly enjoyed the Verbarrator. It has helped him tremendously.  We went to the states for a 3 month furlough when we returned the Verbarrator was no longer working.  When you call Verbarrator, you are actually calling a call center.  They take your information and then the company calls you back(although this isn't explained to you).  If you live internationally this may cause you problems if you need help.  We live in the jungle so we can not leave a call back number so we have been calling for a month trying to get his worked out.  I was very impressed that the president of the company called to solve the issue today.  He was extremely helpful, pleasant, and nice.  Together we were able to work the issue out in a short bit of time.  First off the person who bought the program has to be the one who calls/emails and you have to have the correct email address to match the name and all the purchase information(especially the product key).  Then the issue can be resolved quickly.  We are very pleased with the product.  I was very happy with the assistance that the president provided.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verbarrator-Version-1-1-Windows-Version/dp/B002EADP1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)</a>"
OK
I found this software easy to install and it works great.
"I strongly discourage purchasing this product because (1) the software is poorly and simplistically designed and (2) the content is a lazy assembly of stuff that does not promote learning.  I ran the software on a 1.6 Ghz machine with 60 GB harddrive, so the performance issue clearly was not on my side.  As far as the simplistic design, in the multiple choice select-a-picture section, for example, the answer would be in the same quadrant for a series of questions.  This issue persisted throughout, leading to a lazy learning/teaching experience.  Continuing with the shortcuts taken by this manufacturer, the photos designed to promote Italian language learning were not of Italian subjects.  What a crime to charge $165 for this software!"
As always a great product to use to do taxes.
"Very lightweight antivirus, because the amount of CPU power it takes to run this program constantly is slim to none.. This is my 2nd year using Webroot and I have experienced absolutely no infections. There are no cons of using this product! Very simple to use/understand and contains plenty of helpful features."
"can not get this item to download, useless on a Mac, says it is for a Mac, it is not, wasted money"
"I have been using Premier 2006 for a long time. After upgrading to Windows 7, because Premier 2006 doesn't run under Windows 7 I had to keep one computer running on Windows XP just for Premier 2006. It was really inconvenient. After a while, I decided to upgrade to Premier 2012 because it runs on Windows 7. It was a horrible horrible experience. After I purchased the software from Amazon, the package arrived damaged. Luckily the software DVD was ok. Then I installed the software and began to restore/convert my company file from 2006 to the newly installed 2012. It simply didn't work. I followed the instructions in the help page, tried several different methods (Restore backup file, open portable company file, and open company file directly). It simply didn't work and kept showing me error code (-1,0). The support guy from Intuit helped me two days and we spent hours and still both he and I were clueless. It has wasted me so much time. This is a poorly poorly built software. If upgrading from an old version to a new version becomes this difficult, the developers of this software should be blamed and ashamed of themselves (I am a developer myself)!!! Unfortunately because my company file is in Premier 2006 we cannot switch to a new software easily. If there is an alternative solution/software, I will abandon QuickBooks immediately. This experience is just so bad!!!"
"This is just a review of Word, as I don't extensively use Excel or the others. I do know from past experience though that it's unlikely that Excel has gotten any smarter.

Microsoft... where to begin? It's old news by now, but I still believe The Ribbon is a crime against humanity. It's one thing to change the user interface, but to do it in a way whose logic is indecipherable is... is stupid. Further amping up the stupid quotient is that much of ""the plumbing"" (the dialog boxes, the way you have to dig through several boxes to do anything, even the appearance, etc.) underneath the ribbon is from the same old Word whose functionality probably peaked with Word 2000 (I'm a long-time Word user since its DOS days).

Anyway, I reluctantly bought Office 2016 hoping that the bugfest that was Office 2010 had been fumigated. Well, so far, I've discovered that Microsoft has traded one set of bugs for another. One noticeable bug is that paragraph styles come and go, depending on Word's moods. They got rid of useful stuff like Picture Manager (which I had to reinstall from Office 2010) and modified AutoCorrect so it's slightly less useful. Typical. One bug of Word 2010 was that it hated keyboard shortcuts, which seems to have been fixed in 2016, but it's early.

In sum, if you're using an older version like 2010 or, even better, Word 2000, there is absolutely no reason to upgrade. Microsoft merely made it ""better"" looking (debatable) but no more useful and arguably less productive (especially when you have to go searching for a function). Since they imposed the ribbon it's become far less customizable than 2000/2003.

Update, February 2016. Been using more extensively and I want to pound my head against the wall. It would be less painful. Had to almost completely rebuild AutoCorrect after Word had a brain-fart. Serious question: Do Microsoft secretaries type on IBM Selectrics? 'Cause that would be more productive. Open a document and Word is NOT smart enough to display all of the existing styles in the Ribbon; you have to modify it yourself. Brilliant, simply brilliant."
The bad reviews are about the pen not working. I am wondering if people didn't read the instructions. You have to hold down the power button for a full 5-10 seconds for it to turn on. I had thought I didn't have a working pen either until I read this. Now it works! The kids love the globe!
"I was very skeptical of this product based on past upgrade experience and current online reviews.  I have been a long time Quicken user with my previous version being Quicken 2013.  When R4 of Quicken 2016 was released, the reviews started offering some encouragement so I decided to try it.  My installation and upgrade experience was completely trouble free.  Everything worked just as you would expect it to.  The product installed, it converted my old file to the new format, and prompted to install the R4 patch when completed.  My data all converted cleanly.  All accounts were as they should be with no lost accounts or data.  I was very pleased.  I decided to keep going and try the Quicken Cloud features so that I could access my information with my smart phone.  That didn't go so well.  I activated everything and had to reset passwords.  I could never get beyond the password.  Even after repeated resets, logging on via my web browser with the new password, I could never get to the sync process or access my data from my phone. That's why it's a 4 star review and not a 5 star.  The features available via the smart phone would not be all that useful to me, even If I could get to them. I would really like to be able to enter credit card transactions on my phone and have them automatically sync with my Quicken database.  That capability does not appear to be available.  Nor are all accounts available.  So, I will pass on Quicken's cloud service and continue to use Personal Capital to view my accounts via my smart phone.

I have not found any significant new functionality in Quicken 2016 compared to Quicken 2013.  There ara a couple of minor cosmetic changes, but nothing that would drive me to an upgrade.  My only reason for upgrading was to keep the transaction download and online account reconciliation capabilities from going away.  I think this is close to extortion, but that's just my opinion.  Quicken is such a good and comprehensive personal financial management tool that it's hard to come up with meaningful improvements that would justify an upgrade.  When it does everything that you need it to do, and does it well, why would you need to upgrade?  Intuit's answer is to remove some of what it does unless you upgrade.  Hopefully, the new owners will bring a more positive approach."
"I gave this software to my son who frequently creates video for youtube and twitch.  Here are his thoughts:

This review is based on approximately 4 hours of usage, and may be updated pending further research. The computer was running the latest version of Windows 10.

The software is very similar to Adobe Premiere Pro, so if you're familiar with that program, then the features of this one will come readily.

Some of the nice features of this program include drag and drop inclusion of media, a media library, and easy marking on videos.

But the problem is, the sound and video always de-sync, even before the video fully processes. I tried opening the test file multiple times and processing the video, and each time the audio was off sync with the video. This is too crucial of a mistake to overlook, and as such, I cannot recommend this software at all."
"I looked for video editing software that could handle .mts files from my Canon. These are HD files. The video studio pro x2 is very good, it works well on a dell laptop with a 2.6 dual core and 3 gigs RAM. When I bought it I went for the bundle that included paint shop pro, even though I have pretty good freeware for retouching photos. What a mistake! PSP has crashed more times that I can count. Every time I click on an icon to do something it takes 30 seconds or more before that feature will work. I have seen the ""not responding"" line many times. I'm basically giving up on this. Buy VideoStudio, but stay away from PaintShop Pro"
It was hard for me to get it all set up since it was not a disk and it did not replace the starter version. After i had it installed it was working great so no real complains. Thanks for the fast delivery.
Still not as good as Quicken for Windows. Reconciling accounts is difficult.
"Update:
After getting thru the 2nd disk - I'm very unhappy with the number of errors as other reviewers here have reported.  I've reported these and Fluenz really should correct these ASAP.

My husband and I have tried to learn Spanish a number of times over the years.  We'd start out in a class and end up dropping it partially through the course.  We've both stuck with the Fluenz system and learned more in the first few lessons than years of attempting to learn using other methods.
I find the Fluenz method/program actually FUN and look forward to each session.  I like to do one a day although they recommend twice a week.  (I go back and review lessons too.)
Sitting in a classroom and suffering through listening to several other people reciting and trying to learn Spanish used to drive me CRAZY!  Now I have my own personal tutor and I love it!
My husband accidentally messed up one of the disks and it couldn't be played.  He emailed the Fluenz folks with our purchase info and problem explanation.  We got a replacement disk in the mail 2 days later!
I can't say enough good things about this package.  It was money very well spent."
"After opening the packaging and installing, was notified that it would not work with the hardware on my computer.
Purchased & installed hardware recommended, and was underwhelmed by the results."
Will need it again in 2015 !
"This program is way to big and as a writer I don't have time to sit and train a software. This program can not correct simple errors and grammar. This product to me wasted my time, my money and is crap."
"The software is almost like Photoshop and I got it because I couldn't afford Photoshop, it's a bit more basic but I love how easy it is to use. I can scan my drawings and draw them out with the layers and everything!"
"I have been using Norton Internet Security for years and have never had a problem with viruses, my 6 year old laptop ran as good as it did when first purchased. Previous to using this product my computers would last 1-2 years before needing repairs. I would recommend this product to anyone and you can't beat the amazon price!"
"The one thing you should remember is if you are tempted to buy this program, gnaw off your own arms so you can't. I have a history of using Ghost to image a PC so I can mess around and reimage back to where I was before. it's always been clunky but reliable.

When I needed to do the same at home with an HP 2140 netbook I bought a copy of Ghost (now Symantec) 15.0 to do those images. The first thing I did is plug in the external CD that comes with the 2140. It wouldn't read the Norton CD. My MacBook Air could read it and so could my Windows 7 partition of my iMac. So I copied all the files off onto the Windows 7 desktop and burned a new CD. I then took that CD to my 2140 and that successfully read in. Clearly this wasn't setting me up to succeed so far.

I installed the program onto the computer and looked for the disk image capability. It didn't exist, at least not under that name. There was a lot of backup capability I didn't care about but ok, maybe backing up was what I wanted. So I put a dual layered DVD in the external drive and selected one time backup standard compression verify.

It couldn't get 12GB onto an 8.5GB disk and made me use two disks. After a colossal amount of disk swapping, it died with a cryptic error. So I tried it without verification with maximum compression and at least it didn't need another disk. But it died with the same cryptic error. No copy. No visible files on the disk, but something was there by the capacity.

I tried going online to ask for help. I couldn't email, it forced me onto a chat. There was no selection for ghost so I picked the anti-virus section. I waited about 20 minutes for the chat window to go live (admittedly this was 8 in the morning). Finally someone came on and I told the story. He said oh this is the wrong forum. I went off and did 30 minutes of exercise and still the ""transfer"" to the right group had not yet happened. 30 more minutes I'd done my financial bill paying for the week and still nothing.

Ghost is dead. Long live it's successors in other companies."
"item arrived timely, securely packaged. Program started and loaded properly, converting my old files (2011) to the new 2014 format. navigation is improved, as well displaying the tree with more branches."
"I can really see the benefit of this product.  The only reason I gave it four stars is that I can't seem to get to the point of regular use.  I'm sure it's easy once you grow accoustomed to it, but I seem to be having problems with the learning curve.  Perhaps I'll purchase a training video and that will do the trick."
"I have been using Quicken for many years and upgrade every year. I am a heavy user of Quicken for my investment portfolios and planning purposes. For several reasons, I held off purchasing the 2013 upgrade until now.  One of the reasons was the strength of the bad reviews, heavily weighted to the worst I have seen about anything.  Intuit has obviously had problems to have received so much bad press by reviewers.  From my perspective they have apparently overcome some of the problems.  I had a flawless conversion of data and I love the planning and budgeting software.  It is simply the best budgeting software yet.  Budgeting has now become more functional and easy to use.  Intuit has scored big in that area.  I see very little difference from the 2012 version otherwise but the budget function alone was worth the price of the upgrade.  I must note that many complaints about this release were related to the cloud and I haven't tried that yet.  I use Quicken on my desktop and on my notebook when I am traveling.  I have an iPad and the concept of having access on my iPad appeals to me.  I will probably wait a while to go into the cloud with my data until I am satisfied the speed of data entry will not be sacrificed.  I have great confidence in Intuit and know they will get it right in the end."
"THe sale through Amazon of downloadable software is a scam.  I orderd this, downloaded it and entered the keys (serial #) provided.  It would not accept it. Then I tried to return it and this is not an option under my orders for this product.  BEWARE!!

Follow up note: I complained to Amazon. They responded immediately with a refund but indicated it was not the usual policy for software downloads."
"Works great, great Price, on time delivery!"
Good product
"I have purchased 5 copies to up date my families computers. The OS it's self seems to be a fairly decent system. It has been on my Window's machines since beta testing and I like the OS. My problem is when is Microsoft going to get rid of it's cumbersome and useless activation process? On one of my computers after installing updates, my software was deactivated along with MS office. I had to call Microshaft and spend 30 minutes trying to get my OS reactivated. Microsoft needs to look at the way Apple does it. I never have the problems with Apple's software as I do with Microsoft. I should not have to call Microsoft ever time I reinstall a piece of software purchased from them."
"vista is a great example of bloatware, my laptop came with vista and it was really slow for a 2Ghz cpu with 2GB of ram.

The interface reduced my productivity.

I got really annoyed when it kept asking me to enter the admin password for anything i wanted to do.

The battery was supposed to last 1 hour but lasted less than that.

I tried making a copy of a dvd and it wouldnt let me.

Some software of the software i use was not compatible with it.

It totaly sucks. I had to upgrade back to windows xp with a dual boot to ubuntu which has nicer desktop graphics than vista."
Once again I spend a lot of money on junk software. Whats up with this hip roof crap? This is just like the Punch! $h! t. I can't seem to make any other knd of roof. What happened to the Serria Design program that was so simple? It worked flawlessly.
The interface for 2016 is MUCH harder to use then earlier versions but the backups run fine.  What is terrible is how often Acronis pops up Ads on your computer.  It's non-stop!  I had to take Acronis off of my kids computers because they kept clicking on them which led to inappropriate content.
A bit hard to navigate at first. Customer service at iBank is great. Was able to live chat to figure some things out. Only had it up and running for two days so still figuring things out. Better than Quicken 2016 for Mac! Quicken dropped their .QIF file extension so exporting to this new program was a challenge. All in all I am happy.
I use this all the time.
"It is really as good as MS Office except it doesn't have a little more bells and whistles. For basic and presentable office work, this is great aside from it  is free."
"Good program, I think I am learning a lot and a good balance of speaking and writing. I think that the audio tracks for listening in the car is very lacking though. This is definitely a computer based training tool"
"Need to return it, I will keep the online version. I do not like the Mac Desktop version.  Can I please return it?"
It's all good. Easy to install and use. Good for Bracket photos.
"I've used this program now for about a year and a half.  I'm a computer guy too lazy to write my own version to manage my wife's ever growing collectible and art inventory.  Why write a database when there's a canned version that does what I want, right?  Well, this software does what I want, just not the way I'd prefer to do it...lol.  It's more feature packed than I ever expected, and then some, most especially when it comes to reporting and catalog presentations, but it's NOT for novice computer software users who just jump in and think it should work their way.  This means you actually have to understand a bit about how databases work and their structures before diving in because you can't just copy and paste over their pre-packaged startup structure, even though about 90 percent of the people reviewing here did just that, got into trouble and consequently blamed the software (which I suppose is technically at fault despite their failed efforts).  Also, the program itself is not for the simple user who wants some row and column formatted list of their junk.  They're better suited using a spreadsheet for that because this program is designed for complicated and detailed individualized item inventories (think museum curating and institutional level detailing, file attachments and photography).  This program contains VERY complex data structures, so it's not going to be intuitive, especially to those who have difficulty with English language, as in reading it.  One must READ, infer and test, READ, infer and test, FROM THE BUILT IN HELP INDEX, all in order to make this software work for any real application needs, because there is ABSOLUTELY NO technical support available from the developing company.  If I could offer any ONE THING I LEARNED THE HARD WAY in using this program, it would be that sometimes the pointers in your database will get corrupted, rendering your file absolutely unusable.  Sometimes it can happen when you do a backup, others while you're doing entry.  There's no reasoning to it which would indicate why it happens(ed), BUT THAT DOESN""T MAKE THE SOFTWARE USELESS OR UNRELIABLE.  To make this program work consistently and with total data integrity, YOU SIMPLY MUST MAINTAIN MULTIPLE COPIES OF YOUR DATABASE file in different locations on your backup drive(s)...think: the more backups the merrier.  You will NEVER LOSE anything vital if you do this.  If not, you'll eventually lose all of your work, without a sound file as a restore source.  This is because this program defaults to 5 unique backups, appending the date to each of them when they're done, either automatically or manually on demand of the user.  Periodically, it will do a background copy while you're working, and again when you exit and/or enter the software (I find a backup on entry a little strange).  Anyway, do the arithmetic for yourself and you'll see those 5 backups easily become 3 corrupted ones or even all 5, if the software goes buggy in the background.  You can set extra the program to do extra backups but it ignores this in my experience, so good luck with that.  If you do the multiple location backups I'm suggesting, restoring those hundreds of hours of work (one guy here claimed he lost that much data....geez what a goofball) would have been as easy as clicking on the RESTORE button and choosing your date.  All in all, this software can be a little buggy but there is simply NO better, full featured, turnkey home inventory program out there without writing your own in SQL or some dead or obscure software like Paradox, Dbase or Access.  I know this because not only am I a computer guy but I've spent years looking for one to manage our little home museum of junk nobody really needs.  This program's simple enough though and if you're willing to invest a few hours LEARNING how to use it right, you won't be disappointed.  Patience is the key.  Meantime, the latest version I've used it on is Windows 8.1 in 7 compatibility mode, but it works backwardly to Vista."
"Software includes some good SAMPLES of computer games, decent themes, cd labels/insert creator and such. I would recommend this item if you want something to play around with on your computer. But don't expect something wonderful and very useful.  You get what you pay for I suppose..."
"This product does NOT include the state ""efile"" which is an additional $19.99 if paid at time of filing, with an additional $34.99 if you want it taken out of your refund. After paying them more money I came back to write a review, the description is accurate to include the Federal efile. I just want people to know what they are walking into if they choose to efile their state return."
"I was able to use the activation code for the 2014 version for the 2015 version, so I saved about $12 by buying this version. Not to mention the product itself is wonderful and offers excellent computer protection."
I only wish sony vegas had a few more features to compete with adobe.
"I used Avast for several years. It regularly prompted me for updates. A few months ago I agreed to an update. The update disabled my machine. I called Avast and they charged me $179.99 for 1 year of premium support to resolve my problem. I worked with at least 5 different engineers who uninstalled and installed the software several times. They restored my machine to previous set points, to no avail. I spent hours and hours and they said they were done. But I could not use any of my applications. I called HP support and paid them $99 to fix my machine so I could use my applications. Then I looked at my machine and the problem the first Avast support rep told me MUST be fixed still existed. When I called back to ask what could be done to resolve what appeared to be flawed work by their support organization, they hung up on me. I just called support and had Avast uninstalled, because I'm now afraid to update it and have no confidence in their support services. I asked for a refund and was told by a ""manager level"" billing person that I could not get a refund because I used the support services. I told him this felt like armed robbery, since my machine was disabled by the update and they never resolved the problem. No luck getting a refund, no more Avast for me."
Intuit has mislead faithful customers and decided to charge more for features that were previously include. . An upgrade to premier for WHAT!!! This BS. Cant email company to complain.
"This is absolutely the most counter-intuitive software I have ever used.  I would give this zero stars if I could.  Learning curve on this is ridiculously steep, and never ending.  Only purchase this is you can deal with DAYS of frustration, the online videos aren't much help, very basic, and the users guide isn't much better.  All their phone customer service will tell you is they will not tell you how to use it, they will just let you know which video they think will help you - what a TOTAL waste of money"
Great product.  Been a Norton user for years
"I am able to download books and read them on my Surface Pro 4.  However, I do wish I could high-light text."
"I learned Office with this version, so do not have any complaints about the ribbon.  It is convenient and easy for me.  I would recommend this for anyone who needs daily or occasional usage."
every good
"Everything that I could have asked for. A bit of a learning curve because of the enormous number of tools and customizations ... all good problems to have IMO.

The perfect tool for creating comics."
Great Job
"Norton Security Deluxe is the next generation of last year's Norton Security. This package is for 3 devices and at the time of this review is almost twice as much as getting it for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Security-Deluxe-for-5-devices/dp/B015724OVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Security Deluxe for 5 devices</a>!! Go figure. Lesson: It pays to shop carefully for Norton products because often ""more is less"".

The biggest changes I see in this product from last year's Norton product is the branding on the box. To be sure there are incremental improvements. Norton Security Deluxe is like the older Norton Security without  Backup for 5 devices. I think this isn't too bad. I like my security software to evolve and improve more than radically change.

Norton Security Deluxe comes with licensing for 3 devices: Windows, Mac, IOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android. This should be enough for many families but maybe not all. You do not get the same features on all devices. I have Windows and IOS so I'll share my experience with these.

Buying a new subscription is less expensive than renewing an existing one. This is a long pattern with Norton products and buying new can save quite a bit.

Windows Setup:

**NOTE** If you have Norton Security (with or without backup) installed and you get this new subscription you will need to remove your device from the Norton control panel. In theory this will uninstall the older product from your computer (but not remove the IOS app for iPhone/iPad devices). In my case I had to manually uninstall Norton Security and reboot my computer before I could install the new subscription.

Installation is pushed out of the Norton account control panel. AFTER I removed old versions I was able to install Norton Security Deluxe very easily and without problems. I registered the product in my existing Norton account to activate 5 devices I could install. The download went smoothly and installation on my Windows 7 desktop was faster than with older CD based Norton products and similar to Norton Security. I did have to restart my computer.

I found it interesting that the installation branding and the control panel branding is still Norton Security reinforcing my perception of a simple evolution and mostly branding changes.

The controls in the GUI are simple and clear coming from Norton Security.  There are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works. There is a small gear icon for settings on the main screen of the GUI and many controls are hidden in there.

In operation on Windows I feel Norton Security is continues to be ""noisy"" than pre-2015 versions; I don't feel like I'm constantly being marketed to death. It has the same light impact on PC performance as the previous version.  This is a very good thing! The initial full scan came up clean which is no surprise ince I had last year's version installed before this one.

Application Compatibility Problems:

Unlike last year's version I have had no application compatibility problems. Last year's version has issues with VirtualBox. Good news!

Mobile Support:

The IOS app is better than before, but not all that much. It has anti-theft features. It does not include any virus protection. The Anti-Theft features include:
1) locate your phone: this placed my iPhone 6 a quarter mile away!! Also letting it run GPS in the background significantly reduced my battery life.
2) it can ring your phone: I can just dial the number. If the phone is locked it can't be answered...
3) it has a ""scream"" function: makes your iPhone put out an annoying siren like noise

If the ""scream"" actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 5 allowed in this product, don't waste one on an IOS device! The IOS does not do much for me and the GPS locator drained my battery. I have read that Android devices have better support against malware. I don't have an android device to try this out.

Conclusions:

This incarnation of Symantec's Norton line of retail/home security products is pretty good. It finds things other anti-virus software misses. It does not seem to slow things down noticeably. With this version I had no application problems which is an improvement. Mobile support for iPhone/iPad is poor. The user interface is simple and there are advanced controls available if you need them.

If you have last years (or older versions) of Norton installed, be sure to remove it from the Norton control panel and device before installing the new version. I could not find a way to move a device from an old subscription to a new one unless I renewed through the Norton site at a higher price. That's annoying.

Because it's a great product for home users, having to reinstall if you buy a new subscription (vs renewing) and the IOS app remains quite limited I'm giving Norton Security Deluxe 4 stars. It a good product with a few gotchas."
Okay!
Exactly as described! Here are the required final 17 words of my rating. not sure why I'm required a minimum amount of words for the rating. but good product.
Tried the trial version just to get an idea of what it was like. Had it warn me of some shady activities from websites I visited. Works for me; bought the full version after the trial subscription ended.
This solved a problem with my Wi-fi card which suddenly stopped working. Perfect solution and a lot cheaper. Worked fine and solved my problem. Easy to use and well made. So far a great product.
"I bought Studio 8 about 3 months ago.  In that time it has been one headache after another.  This product does not work as described.  The technical support is clueless and each upgrade only causes more problems while not really fixing the existing problems.  If it worked the way it was advertised it would be a great piece of software.  However, if you even get it to work at all you are lucky.  If you work to get around one problem you will only encounter another down the line.  Even during editing the program will frequently just lock.  I do not know how they are getting away with selling this.  They should be forced to give everyone refunds.  This is truly the most flawed and buggy piece of software I have ever witnessed."
"Avast Antivirus is the best antivirus software that we have used to date.  There have been other brands over the years with which we had negative experiences ranging from direct compatibility issues to bogging down operating speed, we have had no such issues with Avast Antivirus."
Works as good as other years
"If you've reinstalled Windows just once in your life, you've learned enough to tackle a full virgin installation of Windows 7 from a system builder DVD. Microsoft has finally created an operating system with so much built-in support and maintenance technology it practically does all the work for you, so if your current Windows XP machine is labeled ""Windows Vista Capable"" or ""Windows 7 Capable,"" this is the way to go. Just to be sure, install and run Microsoft's Upgrade Advisor.  If it passes the 64-bit system requirements, order up!

You can't upgrade from XP to 7; you have to wipe the drive or partition and perform a clean install, but even an upgrade from Vista to 7 is fraught with peril, so you might as well do the same if you're running Vista. Just back up your data and find all your application installation software before you begin. Once you activate Windows 7, it's married to the PC's system board. You can't reuse the product key on another machine unless you can convince Microsoft that the previous PC is out of commission. You're also not eligible for free phone and chat support from Microsoft, but there's a big enough expert user base that you should be able to solve most problems by joining a few Windows 7 users' forums. If you're not building an exotic tricked-out bergamingmaschine with overclocked handmade graphics cards, you shouldn't have much trouble that will require outside help. Your humble author installed Windows 7 64-bit on a MacBook Pro using Boot Camp.  It found our Brother WiFi laser printer and installed the latest drivers and Brother's printer control center.

The biggest advantage: you'll skip all the ""enhanced experience"" software the likes of Dell, HP and Lenovo cram onto their otherwise zippy machines. After the latest updates install, head off to microsoft dot com slash securityessentials and you'll get all the virus and malware protection you'll need absolutely FREE. Pay a visit to your PC maker's website, let 'em scan your system and grab all the latest hardware drivers.

With a system builder DVD, you don't get both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions.  If you should find that 64-bit isn't right for your machine, don't fret.  Just Google the phrase ""legal windows 7 download"" and the first match will show you how to create a 32-bit installation DVD that you can activate on the same PC using the product key from the 64-bit DVD.  The new installation wipes out the old one and that keeps everything legal."
"I am a new teacher and very much into technology; I use my Treo 650 for everything else and decided...why not for work?  I purchased and downloaded this software, thinking, this WILL make my life easier.

After previewing and using the software, I realized not too long after that something really important was missing.  There was no place to capture or measure student grades!!!  Very dissappointing...how can this package have an application to remember the names and schedules of other teachers, but no grading system?  Very dissappointing...how can this package have application to note methods of discipline and no grading system?

I think the writers went into a great deal of detail without remembering to handle an essential basic...grading.

Teacher's P.E.T is cheaper and looks like it helps to grade, moitor student attendance and keep records of pertinent student info!"
I am so very pleased with webroot. I would not use anything else! Why take a chance on another virus protection when webroot sees to all my needs.
"A powerful genealogy tool whose limitations are the result of other genealogical programs, e.g., easy to download GED files from Ancestry.com, but no actual photos, documents, or stories because these do not download from Ancestry.com."
"Am already running SystemWorks, but purchased NIS 2005 for its extra features. Reviews said that NIS integrated well with SystemWorks - onto one menu. [...]. Couldn't even INSTALL the piece of crap. The WARNING said I had to UNINSTALL SystemWorks - FIRST. Those Symantec [...] can't even integrate THEIR OWN SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. I'll NEVER buy from SYMANTEC AGAIN. [...]."
"So I read all the reviews-well almost!  I HAD to upgrade bc my online banking would not work in QB 2007- then I found out the product was not being supported anymore.  This is very frustrating bc the only reason I upgraded was the I NEED online banking...who wants to hand enter tons of transactions?

 Ok that being said- my download from Amazon went smoothly- I am running window 7 64 bit on an HP laptop. I have dual processor and 4 gigs or ram i think. The install of the 2010 went just fine. I did have to convert my 2007 file- I have 2 companies and have only done one- the smaller one.  That went fine. Setting up online banking was ok except I cannotdothe drect connect..I can only do webconnect. That is fine for me bc I like to have some control over what I am downloading.  I downloaded my bank transactions and even used the newer matching window- I am still trying to get how to code a deposit as a sale butthat is no biggie...i willfigure it out. I just went into my P and L report and updated the categoty there. I can change back to the line item register matching if I want as well.
I also did not register the product yet- it gave me some time and I am making my husband sit on the phone to get the validation. I have 30 days in which to get that done.
I gave this a 4 bc of the seamless download and what I have seen thus far. Many of the bad ratings were mostly bc many people are mad that they HAD to upgrade, and that intuit upsells so many things. I am frustrated by this BUT I like the product overall so far and putting the forced upgrade issue aside I think I am much more satified than what I was expectng based on so many of the ratins here.
After I convert my other company - if I have issues I will post here! I hope I don't- but the file is much bigger and more complex!"

"I am not a user of this software, however, I do have a solution for those of you who get errors starting with ""JVM could not be started, the method may have thrown an exception, or JVM could not be started, the heap size -Xmn is too large or is being blocked by an antivirus program or firewall.

It is a problem with a default setting in the printmaster.vmoptions file in the PrintMaster directory in Program Files

Navigate to the installed version of PrintMaster in your Program Files directory.  Find printmaster.vmoptions.

Right click to Open With, or, in Vista and 7, double click and choose Word Pad.

The first entry in the file is -Xmx1024m and I believe this is the default setting.

Change it to -Xmx800m

Click File > Save and close it.

Try opening PrintMaster again.  This solves the issue in 90% of the cases.

This is an idiotic issue with many versions of Print Master and though the fix is simple, I am surprised the problem still exists.

Hope this helps"
this is a very good product. Works good and does what it is supposed to do. My computer works smoothly. recommended.
"This is an amazing program. I upgraded from the pro version to ex becuase I wanted to work on a book of mine. I didn't even need to install the whole software all i had to do is change the lic code to the ex version and register it and it added all the ex attachments. Didnt have to rearrange my preferences either everything stayed the same which is a plus. I highly recommand thia program for novice's and pros a like. Very user friendly its defintaly a great startinf point for digital artists. I waited for the ex version to go on sale but its worth every penny. If you want to start with pro version I highly recommend that as well. Very affordable, very user friendly, very fun. I could not ask for more. I attached a few illustrations I did with this program."
"Here's a warning for anyone who uses Taxcut New Mexico.  If you are a non-resident, NM has you declare how much of your income was earned in NM and how much was not.  Taxcut has this backwards, telling you to put amounts earned in NM into the column reserved for money earned as a non-resident.  Not only that, it won't let you declare amounts from a w-2 as earned as a non-resident.  All in all, it's worthless.  I've used Taxcut for 10 years, but next year I'm moving on.  I wish H&R Bolix had a user feedback feature."

"The finest ""problem fixer"" for you Mac with OS 10.4.11 or less. This software will root out most problems that the mac's internal disc utility won't address. There is no finer utility. Of course for newer Mac OS' you will need version 4.0 or above."
"So Far, So Good"
I was disappointed that the deluxe edition cost more and did not include items from previous years.  They did provide an upgrade without additional charge.
no works
Exactly what I wanted and needed.  Very easy to install.  Gave me the security I expected to get from a Norton product.  I also appreciate Amazon's most competitive price and prompt delivery.
Delivers as usual
"I have found some of the negative reviews offensive, as I consider this an exceptional package that gives you an advanced CRM system with facilities and possibilities that are mindbugling.

It offers email marketing possibilities that no email marketing application can properly compete with. It has exceptional email integration and you don't even have to worry about viruses.

I have been using a number of different CRM solutions, and though Goldmine is not perfect, it is superb in the things that you can ask the software to do for you. I have lately had the displeasure to work with the touted salesforce.com, and in that comparison Goldmine is sublime.

The interface is not terribly user friendly but if you use the system capabilities I have never come across a system that offered more value for money.

There are two areas that I don't like about the application;

1. I deal with companies moreso than with individuals, and if you use the ability to use secondary contacts and define the account at the highest level you loose the part about the application that is truely exceptional - the automated tracks that run on primary contacts only.

2. If you have a call list that you need to go through it is inferiour to ACT2000 that i used before. Going through a call list takes longer, and this will only be fixed by expensive add ons.

Great value for money, especially if you have several sales people. Used right this offers something that I have not seen in other applications, though the two points i mentioned reduces the value.

It is a package with so many add ons that you can develop your use based on standard components. I have not found a better total solution yet!"
"The program is a little buggy, but this could be caused by the fact I'm using Wndows 8.  It locks up the system and I have to give it a hard boot.  Otherwise it's funtionality is better than the newest version of Microsoft Word, which I refused to purchase with my new laptop..  Check back in a little while.  I'm going to re-install 2000; maybe this will correct the problem."
I like this product because it was easy to set up and very ease to use .I set my vcr on my kitchen table and hooked the Honestech up to my laptop and to the vcr .I have already changed over several vhs to dvd .I like that when you are through burning your disk you can copy as many as you want before going to the next vhs .I am very pleased with purchase .  recommend it very highly.
This is a great software package.
Alot of option with this program.
"I've been using PSP (Paintshop Pro) since version 3.11, and Version 7.03 is by far the best so far. The filters are the same as Adobe Photoshop's, and the menu system and previews are great. Undo ability, or as I call it the ""Whoops"" factor, is unlimited to correct mistakes you've made before. Sure, you could pay a lot more for similar products, but why? As for using scanners, color printers, and digital cameras... it's all covered. Twain interfaces are standard, and the corrections you repeatively do can be built into automatic procedures. My biggest gripe... they removed the ""fill pattern"" tool. Minor, and overcomable, but still... it's a great photo/graphics editing program."
"I read some issues with some folks downloading via Amazon downloader (which I never liked from way back and don't install it) and others who followed the drop down instructions on the Amazon order. Instead after I purchased the Amazon Security Deluxe download & copied the key code. I then went to Norton Site (where I have an acct already) and logged in. I forgot exactly where along the way it asked for the new product code but when it did I gave it my new purchase code, then to a page which tried to get me into Auto Renew program which I choose ""Do this later"" since I did not want Auto Renew. Then it took me to the download page of the stub installer which I downloaded. I then ran the downloaded stub (from my downloads folder). The install went off with no problems. It un-installed the 360 and for the most part held my previous 360 settings on the Security Deluxe install when I checked them.
This was on Win7 and then later (same key code) on another Win10 computer I also went to Norton sight directly and renewed that device but the Win10 install was a bit less informative along the way but that could be win10 and not Norton. Have two installs and they both gave me the extra day, showing 366 days on subscription."
"Nice program, fairly easy to navigate.  Price is fair."
"I haven't used this yet, I have used camtasia, and will update when I use it but decided to start with my 12 year old son's review

He needed to create a movie for a school project and put together content from his phone (pics and video) as well as online - he was able to easy cut and paste clips and transition easily, even adding in some nice special effects.  That type of outta the box ease of use is key."
"I don't know why so many negative reviews are being written for this version of the software.

I have been a user since version 9.0 and never ran into any of the difficulities stated in these reviews.  The upgrade to 10.1 which enabled 64 bit funcitonally was clearly communicated to me by e-mail & when I went to the web site.  I received a response within 24 hours from Nuance's general manager when asking about the ability to transfer my license when selling old copies on e-Bay (FYI Nuance does not allow you to transfer your license to another user & I canceled the auctions).  In fact, I've had quite the opposite experience where the Nuance's registration site forgets that I registered my prodcut.  While baffeling, this fact does not diminish my experence with the software.  I have reinstalled (2-3 times) on computers for most of the reasons listed in other reviews and never ""ran out"" of installations.

I still don't like the fit of the headset shipped with the product (why I rated 4 out of 5 stars).  I do need to stress that better ""quality"" microphones exist from other vendors (e.g. Andrea Electronics) that do positively impact the performance of the software.  My specific example is the ""bluetooth"" headset.  I was using a BlueAnt Z9 & purchased an Andrea Electronics BT-200 (highest rated at the time for the bluetooth interface).  This decision made a world of difference regarding performance.  To clarify, the sound input going into the program with the Z9 was not great, so I could not expcet a quality output.  I've since purchased & used the Andrea SuperBeam Array microphone & Plantroics ""plug-in"" USB headset.  All of which made a difference because the sound quality going into the program was improve resulting in a better, faster recongition output.

The major reasons I purchased the version 10 Professional were for the ability to save .dra files (to edit the dicataion at a later time) & the ability to use/program macros.  I consistently use a Sony ICD-MX20 voice recorder (highest rated on Nuance's site when purchased 1-2 years ago) to capture thoughts, take advanage of 10-15 minute delays in the day (e.g between meetings) & to dictate meeting minutes or next actions while there still fresh in my mind, so I can easily retrieve later in the day/week.  I've set up basic macros (in my opinion) and have been pleased with the increase in effeciency.

The recognition accuraccy has improved over time (a bit more than a year now with version 10), especially compared over all the different input sources I use.  The output dicataion is rarely 100% perfect.  However, I can effectively multitask & achieve more in my opinion.

In summary, effort and persistence is required to understand & use this product as well as skill effectively.  In my experience, the energy has been worth it."
"The program installs easily.  It is a little light on the bells and whistles, but appears to be adequately provisioned for its primary purpose.  As to how well it protects the computer, who is to say?  Webroot drastically slows internet browsing and some pages will not load at all."
"I've been using LastPass for years. I use it on all my PCs and on my smartphone.  I've never had a single problem.  Does what it says, and at a buck a month, the premium version is worth every penny and more!

People call cloud password managers ""unsafe"" but that's only because they don't understand how they work.  NONE of your passwords are actually stored in the cloud where someone can read them if the service gets hacked.  LastPass only stores the mathematical mish-mash that results when your passwords are combined with your LastPass passphrase.  So even if someone stormed LastPass's headquarters and took the servers, they'd still need your password to decrypt the information.  When you use LastPass, the decryption takes place on YOUR computer (or phone) so EVEN THEN, the password is STILL never revealed to LastPass.

If you're using the same password(s) on multiple sites, you're going to get bitten eventually.  With LastPass, not only can you use a unique password per website, but you can store and use unique USERNAMES per website, making tracking you down more difficult while keeping you safe."
"Quicken Deluxe 2014 fast shipping well packed, what can I say it is Quicken, it has the same general look as my 2010 Quicken has and so far it has not stumped me. It is a shame that it has to be improved so I have to waste time (that I never will make up) to use it."
"First of all, I'm an ex-MS Money user, so a bit part of my review would be focused on comparison with MS Money. I've used MS Money for 5+ years and since MS Money was discontinued by Microsoft (i.e. can no longer use online services, which I rely on to download statements from my bank/credit card/brokerage), so I had to switch to quicken.

1. Importing my MS Money file:
Mostly uneventful here, almost all my transactions and accounts were migrated without major issues. It also generates a report showing you some errors and warnings that happened during the conversion. There were still some accounts whose balances were not right so I had to review them manually myself and fix those. One minor annoyance is the character limit on the account name was quite small, but even if the character limit is longer it won't display well on the account list, which truncates long account names.
2. Investment/Brokerage account:
In quicken you can choose to have the cash balance of your investment/brokerage account tracked in a separate account or not. Naturally I chose to have the cash balance in the same account because most of the time the cash balance is 0 for my accounts. The problem is, you can only do that for your brokerage account. If you have a 401(k) account, you don't get to choose! After converting my MS money save file quicken created a separate cash account for my 401k and there's no easy way to combine the cash account and the 401k account! The only way to fix this is to manually go through all the transactions and edit them (and for that particular account, I have 4 year's worth of data). Some of these restrictions seem arbitrary, if I can combine the cash & investment account for normal brokerage accounts, why not 401k accounts?
3. Setting up online downloads
Being able to download transaction history into my financial management software is really important for me. I guess I got used to it in MS Money and can't live without it now. In MS money I opening up the settings of the account, select the financial institution, type in userid and password, then MS money will start downloading for me. In Quicken, not so easy. First, download the web connect file, import into quicken, then select the accounts to apply the imported transactions to, then open up the account options, click improve connection, type in userid and password. If that sounds tedious, it is. (and it doesn't work for all my financial institutions, I think it's fewer than what MS money supports, at least for my case). Oh, and if you want Quicken to remember passwords for you, you need to set up the password vault which has a separate password! I already set up a password for my quicken profile, why do I need to set up a separate password for the password vault?!! Alright, let's say you've set up all the online services correctly, then you hit download (update), the window stays in the foreground while you download. If it takes a second I don't mind, but it usually takes longer than that, and if you financial institution needs answers to secret questions to log you in, then you have to enter that every time! for each account!!! In addition, some accounts that I have set up successfully fail to update afterwards, it'd say that my password is wrong, I checked with my financial institution and they say it's not their problem so I'm not sure what's wrong here.
4. Performance
I have no idea what complex, CPU/IO intensive computations quicken need to perform, but it seems that any operation I need to do, the screen flashes, the disk spins before the operation is performed. If I need to update more than 10 rows of transactions at once, e.g. to change the category, the screen flashes a few times, and it takes one or two seconds for it to complete. Reconciling downloaded transactions? screen flashes a few times again before completion. The worst is when you need to initiate the online update, even bringing up the dialog takes seconds.
5. UI
Simply said, the UI sucks. Unless you look at the report charts all the time, most the of time you're looking at a yellowish background with yellowish panels. There're some rounded corners in the controls, but some still look like they're from the Win98 era. A lot of it is not customizable either, e.g. you can show the account list widget in the ""home"" page and it spans the width of the screen, if you add some other widget onto the ""home"" page, it may split the screen into 2 columns and display them side-by-side or it may display it below the account list widget, but you have no control over that.
6. Other stupidities that I can think of
a/ net worth calculation don't take into account your hidden accounts (closed accounts in MS Money), since I did a refinance on my mortgage last year and thus hid the old mortgage account, my net worth last year it significantly higher than my net worth this year
b/ For any transaction history of any account, you can filter the transactions base on dates and whether the transaction is reconciled or not, e.g. you can view only the uncleared transactions in the current quarter. The problem is, the ""ending balance"" at the bottom of the transaction list only reflects what's shown in the account list! If you want to see the real balance of the account, you either have to show ALL of your transaction history, of switch to the account overview.
c/ You can't edit the ""memo"" field if you're using a one-line register option, so if you regularly use the memo field, stick with the 2-line register display.
d/ Quicken remembers your commonly used payee and offers auto-completion when you enter new transactions, the problem? if you pick one of the old payees, all the information associated with the last transaction to that payee will get copied into your new transaction and you need to edit them all (if you use the one-line register then you won't have the option to edit the memo field). MS Money is smarter in this regard, it only copies the category from the last transaction to the payee.

I'm already addicted to having a personal finance management software on my desktop so having a mediocre software is still better than having none (and I don't trust stuff that store your info online either). So I just have to live with quicken. Arguably Quicken has more functionality than MS money, but the poor UI and unintuitive controls greatly diminished the potential of the software."
"I was annoyed that the program wouldn't let me print a copy of my return while I was working on it, but when I got ready to e-file, it said I had to update it first, and then it wouldn't let me do it."
"I give this software 5 stars.  I took a class in college about Photoshop.  I was interested in buying Photoshop, but found this corel bundle package for 70.00.  It is a steal for the quality of work it puts out and it matches if not surpasses photoshops quality.  I absolutely love this software.  I recently did a road trip in California with my girlfriend, and took over a thousand pictures.  The paint shop pro helped to add the missing touches to my photos, while the video software allowed me to make a video/picture slide show with music in the background.  I am even using it in my classroom now! (I am a P.E. Teacher).  I tape myself doing certain activities then put the words of the critical elements of each skill on the screen.  I HIGHLY recommended this to anybody who wants easy to use great quality software."
"This year I switched from (ever more expensive) TurboTax to H&R Block.  I'm generally pleased with the H&R Block (HRB) program so far.  However I am running into trouble with Form 1116 Foreign Tax Credit.  One of the mutual funds I have paid foreign tax, and I have to fill out Form 1116 to get a credit for that tax paid.  First of all, HRB cops out a little on this form by having the user switch back and forth between the interview (for an explanation of what to enter) and the IRS form for every line that must be filled in--a cumbersome process to say the least.  Then the descriptions in the interview mode appear to have little or no resemblance to what is shown on the IRS form. So far I have been unable to get HRB to calculate my foreign tax credit correctly and carry it over to Form 1040."
"I was trying to signup to enable my credit card information to be downloaded into quicken.
This did not work.  The registering site continually DID NOT like my selected user name but had NO explanation what they didn't like.  I gave up."
"I purchased this software based on the box description, which listed 1)several activities and skills, 2) the words ""Award Winning"" (I should have known - there was an "" * "" after those words, but it related to no explanation), 3) the age for play as 3-5 years,  and 4) the Sesame Street label. Unfortunately, this software wasn't worth purchasing. It's VERY basic and boring. Kids can learn a lot while playing quality computer games which provide fun, some challenges and choices, and creativity along with learning. This game is unable to do that.

I was able to download it on our Mac OSX 10.4.11.  Some Mac users have had issues with installation so if you have a Mac, be aware of that snafu.

The game consists of 5 areas of play: Letters, Numbers, Creativity, Classifying, and People. The problem with the game is that all of it's activities are boring and  not creative, and the instructions are too long, repetitive, and fingernails-on-the-chalkboard annoying to any adult within earshot.

Examples:
For the counting, the game shows the numbers 1-10 with some of the numbers missing. After a long explanation of how to play, the child is to select a misplaced number to put in the correct spot. After doing this, the only thing to happen is the [screechy] muppet slowly counts out the numbers 1-10. What's fun about that? Nothing. Each game has instructions given by a Muppet. The instructions are tedious and lengthy, and repeated over and over for each game played.

The art & creativity area is very basic. Shapes or pictures can be ""clicked"" onto the art board, but nothing much other than that.

The ""People and Places"" section consists of a few videos showing various neighborhood people. Each video is very, very short and Bob sings ""The People in Your Neighborhood"" along with each video.

Game navigation is very poor. There's no way to speed up or skip instructions, or to move quickly between the different games on each level. There's lot of chatting between Muppet characters that doesn't add to the game, and you can't navigate out of. This slows the game down considerably.

The age of game play of 3-5 years is too old. The games are basic that they would appeal to only the very youngest of users and the long verbal explanations for each game would be of interest to, again, only very young users. I would say that 3 years old is probably the max age for full enjoyment of this game."
Too many unnecessary changes that took valuable time trying to revert (when possible) back to an earlier edition. I'm going back to 2010
"Okay, I purchased a subscription to this product and it is missing all the functionality of the previous versions.  When I logged into my account to 'unlock' the pro features I got what?  A color palette?  No brush creator, no filters, no fine  brush controls.  In short, none of the simple effective tools that made previous versions of this program so useful.  If you're going to buy this buy the disc, not the subscription because so far that is just an incompetent money grab besmirching the reputation of a formerly useful program."
Norton software is the best software to protect all you PC's. Runs in the background and not only protests you from harmful viruses but also keeps your PC backed up.
"The program is very accurate, just go through the easy set up process and start using it. I highly recommend this software to all writers who need the creative aspect easier to accomplish."
OK
"Very pleased with the Dazzler and included software.  It installed easily and very intuitive to use.  After a few minutes, I was converting old home movies from VHS tape to DVD and adding voiceover annotation.  Over all, excellent value!"
"The software did not work and was stuck in my computer for days. Not recommended to go this route, definitely do everything through Apple directly if you need a software update."
"Amazon evidently have little interest in the Windows platform. This app is terrible on a Windows tablet, and skips chunks of text throughout books on my Windows phone. The app design is ugly and search on my phone is non existent. It is so bad that to load a book from my 800 book collection, I have to manually scroll thru the entire collection to get at books near the end. TBH I would sadly use the very nice KOBO app any day over the Amazon app."
This worked just fine on my computer. I also put it on my sons and a friends. This is a great package and one of the best products for your computers protection!
I have changed from a PC to  Apple. I was not able to do the same editing of pictures as done on the PC Microsoft Windows. This software now allowed me to do some of editing lost.
"Such an awesome game, great for learning. My son loves all these pixar movies, and the great thing is he doesnt know he's learning. Great idea!"
"I was forced to upgrade from Quicken 2009 or the online banking would stop.  The installation went fine, and the conversion of my old file went well.  Initially, the entering of information was painfully slow, bit I found information on the Internet about running File | File Operations | Validate and Repair.  After that, everything was fine.

Nothing earth shattering, but it is personal finances, so I wasn't expecting much.

The one good thing is that there were a couple of financial institutions I use to have to manually download, and now these can be set-up and run automatically."
Love Turbo Tax
It's been working well for over a year. A key issue I experience frequently though is that the prl_vm_app process can use 200%+ CPU and causes the host macbook pro overheat with fan running at maximum noise.
Viedo was just what I needed.
"I purchased this item as an introduction to green screen photography. It does an amazing job pulling the subject out of the background. As a result of this item, I decided to update to a ""Pro"" version of the software and background."
"Fantastic buy!!  It was a delight for my children, and okay, me too!  This is a perfect gift for any little girl or boy, whom ""like to cook."""
It Would not let me load it an directed me to an overseas company asking for a $149 to install it with a out of country charge  with receipt form Harry Norton
"I have been using Quicken for a very long time, probably more than 15 years. I have recommended it many times in the past. However, I am very disappointed in the lack of a Windows phone version. While I knew when I upgraded  that a Windows phone version was not yet available, but I expected to be able to enter transactions through a mobile website.. I'm not looking. for full synchronization, but just to enter transactions then download them on my PC.

I'm also very disappointed in Intuit's lack of response to the many people complaining about no Windows Phone version"
very nice
"I got it about a month ago, it has worked as advertised for me so far. I am not aware of any virus it's or not catching.  I like their update about known virus, kind of fun interactively.  The security index is fine with me, I hardly look at it and when I do, it gives me pretty good info. I would have to say that you are better off buying the bundle (for normal user).  Since the bundle is only like 50 dollars, it's cheaper than buying all the separate components.  I saw this on sale (whosave dot coom, shows you online sales) at the time so I bought it.  I don't have to pay for virus definition subscription, and i don't know when that will run out.  for novice user I think this product is fine, you are mainly buying peace of mind and usability is more important."
"We had the program freeze up on us several times. Called tech support and they helped us through the problem. After that we were able to the process of unfreezing on our own. We have been using Turbo Tax for 5 years now and it is a breeze. We file with deductions each year, it is very user friendly. Wouldn't do our taxes any other way. Love Turbo Tax!"
"A lifesaver, year after year."
Perfect for home use. Installed easily. State downloaded easily. Taxes completed in a snap and uploaded with no problems! AAA+++
Product lacks international currency features... for this kind of $$$ they should provide reasonable customer support and enable you to buy and sell in foreign currency simply and easily... primitive software in many ways. Disappointing!
"I hope if you buy this, you wait for it to go on sale (or lightning deal).  I picked it up for 35 bucks for my Nuvi 760.

For the people that complained that they needed to get an SD card, they clearly should have done their homework before buying the upgrade!  Do you expect 'just any tires' to fit on your car, just because you have a car??!  Seriously...  Of course, its the manufactures problem that they don't have space.

I think you need about 780MB of free space (say 1G to be safe) to install the full north america map.  If you don't have an expansion slot, you're really SOL with this upgrade.."
"I updated my WinDVD 7 with WinDvd 8 only to be disappointed. I tried the program on two computers. On my first computer I cant even get the program to open, all I get is errors (but WinDVD 7 works fine.) On my second computer I can play DVD's, but many times it will display a dll error and close when trying to use simple options such as trying to attempt fast forwarding. The software is buggy and not as stable as WinDVD 7. If you already have windvd 7, I would recommend you to stick with the current software. I tried downloading updated versions of WinDvd 8 only to keep getting error messages. I can play a movie straight through most the time if i don't pause, fast forward, rewind or use any other options. I have had WinDVD 8 for a few weeks now without any resolutions. Please be aware before purchasing."
"After installing this program, it was a little frustrating to have to restart my computer several times for the next few days to ""update"" the Spyware software.  Part of this may have been due to the Trend Micro Internet Security software I was using at the same time.  Once I uninstalled that and installed Norton Internet Security 2009 I've had little problem.  It seems to run effortlessly in the background and doesn't appear to slow my computer down. I'm not sure it's any better than lots of other spyware programs but it does the job.

UPDATE:  After owning this a few months, I can say it runs quietly in the background, updates itself constantly, and has kept most spyware at bay.  I would recommend it."
works for me
Fine
"A friend of mine bought a new lap top computer from Dell. He asked me to partition his drive for him. I told him he had a couple of options: Partition Magic from Symantec, or Disk Director from Acronis. Since I've heard that Symantec is not supporting PM under Vista yet, I suggested that he try Acronis. After two days of trying to partition his hard drive with Acronis, I gave up. It just wouldn't do it. I contacted Acronis and they suggested that instead of running the software from Windows, that I run it by booting off of the CD. I actually thought this would work, and would have found it an acceptable work-around, had it worked. But it didn't. I wound up installing Partition Magic and it had no problem partitioning the hard drive on the first try."
"Downloaded, installed it per directions, and it won't save a file, by any name. Previous returns aren't recognized either. I've performed the ""de-installation"" procedure twice, and reloaded from the Amazon server, still no joy.

I guess I'll have to wait until they do another update and see if it's fixed. Until then, It just doesn't work as you can't save your input.

Hold onto your money for now."
i have a hard time going back and changing things. I understand that the federal tax code is so complicated that It takes a genius to understand it but you sort it out well. I guess that I am to old to change and expect to know everything.
Easy to install so far work great
This alone is worth the annual Prime membership cost. It is amazing!! Such an incredible music selection and the playlists have expanded my musical interests exponentially. I could spend hours just discovering new music!
"This program works the same as my Quicken 2015 for Mac.  I upgraded because I got a discount, and because one of the 'new features' was bill paying from Quicken.  I should have read the fine print.  It works with 450 banks, unfortunately, my bank isn't one of them."
this s***
Out-freaking-standing. It works perfectly and was a heckuva deal.
"Good product, does what it's supposed to."
Love it installed on both PC's with no issues! Lot of cool stuff in one package!
"Well, it does the taxes; what more need be said.  Easy to use."
"Excellent software , recommended."
I recently purchase videowave 4.0..I own Sony TRV20 digital camcorder. It's proved to be a waste of money. The software does not support this camcorder. It will not recognize the existent of the camcorder. I have a gateway computer with recommended firewire card said to to 100 % compatible with the software. I spent [a lot] in order to have the ability to edit my video on computer. It is proven to be a complete waste thus far. I spent countless of time on mgisoft website in no avail. The company should anticipate this problem and should provide an update downloadable patch. Attempted to contact mgi by phone in no avail(spend may be..just wait for the darn human to respond). I hope mgisoft read this message. It's the only way that I might have a chance of getting messages to them.
"Purchased Dell XPS 15 with touch screen running windows 8.1 and wasn't sure which Antivirus software suit to install this time.

I checked several of the Antivirus Testing Labs ( AV Test to name one ).

Windows Defender was rated worst ( see bottom of this comment for details ).

Bitdefender & Kaspersky were rated as one of the best in all categories ( Protection, Performance, Usability ).

I really wanted to go with Kaspersky because one year free subscription came with XPS 15 purchase.

I read a lot of reviews and there seems to be a love hate relationship with all Antivirus Suites.

After much deliberation I decided to stick with Norton Internet Security 2014 ( NIS ), since historically, it's seems to have always worked and I NEVER had any viruses or malware to best of my knowledge on any of our systems at home or work.

In past NIS used to be very bloated and consumed lots of system resources. Symantec seems to have enhanced and improved NIS quite a bit in past couple of years. It's lot less bloated and uses lot less system resources.

Again, I really wanted to install and use Kaspersky; however, I've ready too many reviews and heard to many conflicting experiences. Some swear by it, others swear because of it.

Concerning Windows Defender on Windows 8.1

a. Ran Windows Defender several times and it worked.
b. Last time I ran Windows Defender system froze ( no keyboard response )
c. Got a Blue Screen of Death ( BSOD ), which I've not seen in several years on any of my systems
d. Had to revert system to an earlier known good point ( known good restore point )
e. All configurations and software installations were lost
f. Drive doesn't appear to be healthy ever since
g. Needless to say, I won't be using Windows Defender ever again on Windows 8.1
h. Never had problem with Windows Defender on Windows 7

Windows Defender on XP/Vista/7 detects and removes known spyware only. It is not designed to protect against the full breadth of malicious software, and specifically does not prevent viruses, worms, Trojans, and other malicious software from infecting your machine."
This installed perfectly on my Dell 4600
"This will be my last year in TurboTax.  Along with the [C-dilla] and activiation issues (covered in other reviews), the download and purchase process for the state return was difficult because of the way the software connected and the information given by the TT servers.  Instead of just saying ""the servers are busy"" the program locked up my computer and froze my connection to the internet each time it failed.
I am done with intuit.ants to steal software, who cares about the protection scheme?  Use it for a few days to do your taxes and delete it when you're done."
"This is the best product for filing tax returns, either by mail or electronically, period."
"My 4 year old will play this, finish it, then get up and say ""DONE"". Need an hour, pop it in. Game is the same every time, she cares 0%."
"Roxio took an already great DVD copy product and made it even better. I bought the original Popcorn when it first came out and have had nothing but success with it and this new version. Installing and using it is completely Mac-like simple.  It even spurred me to buy the pc version for my laptop.

Now I've got the best of both worlds. I can back up my DVDs and also convert them and store a bunch of them on my Mac's hard drive so I can use the Front Row software to watch them full-screen with my new Intel iMac remote. Plus I can put them onto my iPod to watch when I travel.

A great product that takes advantage of Apple's hardware options."
"In many ways FileCenter is exactly what I have been looking for for more than a decade as a paperless solution for my home office. I had been using Neat Receipts (now just Neat) for about five years. I never loved it, and over time grew to hate it, as just one individual's records quickly put the hurt on the capabilities of its proprietary database storage format. Four gigabytes for barely a thousand pages of documents? It was slow and cumbersome to use, crashed a lot, and I saw little value in the non-standard bubbly user interface. All I really wanted, for the most part, was to turn my paper into PDFs. Every time the a new version of the software was released, a lengthy database update had to be done, and I was always waiting for something to go wrong and corrupt everything. (There are plenty of stories of this happening to people; I was lucky).

This year I finally hit the wall with it, and looked for a better solution, and stumbled across FileCenter.

FileCenter Pro is lightweight, fast, and doesn't use a proprietary database. Your files just sit in the Windows filesystem, which is fantastic in so many ways. It is probably just as fast if you have a dozen files or 100,000, since it doesn't use a bloated database. You can use any software you already own, and are familiar with, for backing up, viewing, and working with the files. You can index and manage any kinds of files. You can rearrange things with the familiar Windows explorer, and so on.

FileCenter is at its core an Explorer-like UI that integrates a number of tools. It uses PDF X-Change for viewing, editing and indexing PDFs, and the OS built-in Windows Search index for indexing, though you can optionally use dtSearch instead, again included. It has a great many tools for creating profiles that are handy for speeding up the laborious process of turning paper into PDFs: profiles for scanning and optical character recognition, templates for file naming, layouts of the directory structure, organizational helpers. And it worked fine with my Neat scanner.

There is a downside to this simplicity, though. Because there's no database, there's no metadata. One thing which the Neat software did well was to parse information out of the OCR'd data of your scans, and prepopulate metadata about your documents: e.g. receipt $ amount, dates, and so on. FileCenter doesn't do any of these things. It's much more like Google - just scans, OCRs, and indexes. So if you are accustomed to using something like Neat that will let you track metadata and create reports (like summaries of receipt amounts by category), you can't do that.

You can store some data using ""PDF Keywords', a feature of the PDF file format, though it's not especially convenient. To access them, you need to manually open properties for the PDF after it's scanned by selecting it and typing CTRL+D, and then enter data in an open-text field.  After some experimentation I found I could create key/value pairs in the PDF keywords, for example:

  ""category=insurance; type=receipt; amount=1500.00""

Searching on ""category/insurance"" will find everything that has that key/value pair. So this is some help, but it would be nice if the UI had some tooling to help populate this data, like letting you set up pre-defined labels to use, and some form that would let you easily fill them out each time you scanned a document. Even better, how about a little intelligence to parse out dates and dollar amounts like Neat does. I don't think this would be very hard since the documents are already OCR'd, it would be pretty easy to recognize common date and dollar value formats.

Once that data is in there, it's fine for searching for things, but you are still on your own for aggregating dollar amounts. Since I happen to be a computer programmer, I'll probably just write some basic program to do this to suit my needs, but again this is something that would be of immense value to include with the package, and wouldn't be especially difficult to implement.

At the end of the day, while I wish it offered a few value-added features as I've described, since it doesn't use any kind of proprietary system for managing your files, it leaves you free to solve those problems using other tools, unlike all-in-one packages such as Neat which lock you in completely. This is far more important to me than having to possibly add up some receipts by hand once a year (until I write that app to parse out my PDF tags :). I hope Lucion considers enhancing their software in this way which would make it more directly competitive with some of the more mainstream consumer-facing products which, although feature laden, are invariably awful to use in practice.

Summary: It keeps your data where it belongs, in your file system, and provides some great features for scanning, managing, and organizing a large amount of electronic data. It lacks features for creating metadata, but there are workarounds. Perhaps this might be a future enhancement idea for Lucion. I could also imagine some other app easily filling that gap, which is a good thing: since everything is just files, you have no limits on what else you can use to manage them. I expect this software will have a lot of longevity, unlike Neat, it should be difficult to outgrow.

Note: I bought FileCenter Pro directly from the Lucion's web site."
Ordered Peachtree 2005 Complete accounting and received a replacement disk that you can't register therefor the product is useless. There was nothing in the ad that stated this was a replacemnet disk. False advertisement on their part I do believe. I would not suggest buying from this company.
"I have used this software for a long time, of course different versions, but the Professional version is the best, it is so quick, versatile and provides online additional fonts, templates, designs etc. love it.  Now keep in mind I am currently using windows 8.1."
Did not work as promised
"You have got to be kidding. Do not try this on a USB3 drive. It will not work. Cannot believe that Avanquest does not trumpet this non-capability on their site. Sure it is in the small print, BUT the market has moved to USB3.0 The interface is fine for me, but I need the 3.0 capability."
"This is an enjoyable game, & educational as well. For the price, it's worth buying. The puzzles aren't difficult, but challenging enough to keep it interesting. The game reminded me of an easier version of Myst. You don't need to have prior knowledge of physics - a handy reference guide is available as part of the gameplay. The only drawback was that the screen was small. Maybe that could have been fixed, but I didn't want to mess with the setup since some games can be finicky on XP."
What's not to love?
"- Smooth integration with Outlook and IE.
- Better than McAfee
- A better interface would have been nice.
Edit: I don't know why there are so many negative reviews. Too many DFUs I guess. I have never had a problem with this and after using it for two months I'm going to increase my rating from 4 to 5 stars. Activation? So what? It took less than 5 seconds. If you are a legit owner I don't see what the big deal is."
It working excellent
I've been a user of Office for the Mac for years.  This new version provides all the features I expected with some great improvements to solve problems I've run into in the past.  I love the Compatibility Reports to make sure my documents will display correctly on a Windows machine.
"Needed to replace Windows Vista on a desktop prior to transferring files to a new Windows 8 laptop.  The upgrade installed flawlessly.....and allowed me to then uninstall files on my desktop that I did not need, prior  to the file transfer. (My windows installer within Vista became corrupted---nothing worked to restore it!  Even tech support from Microsoft could not repair the Windows Installer file that is needed to install and remove programs!)  Upgrading the operating system to Windows  7  was the only answer.  I was now able to
complete the file transfer to the new laptop.  Windows 7 is  much more stable than Windows Vista was.  I still prefer it over Windows 8."
Love the user-friendliness of the product and of your staff
Received wrong product.  Instead of MS Office 2010 Home and Student 3 PCs received MS Professional 2010 German edition 1PC.  Returning for refund.
"It is, what it is.  Tax software that works as expected.  Necessary evil."
"Really easy to use, and such a great value!!! It took me no time at all to create a stellar resume."
This software looks like it is out of the 80s and it has some fun stuff on it. It does freeze up on our computer some so not sure if that I our computer or what.  There are five different subject areas for the kids to play on.
"I bought this at a 'going out of business' sale at a local store.  My kids were about to upgrade to Gamecube and this was one of the games they didn't want to lose, but would.  I was pleasantly suprised that this is the exact same game!  I was only hoping to kind of fill the gap, not completely!  It is difficult to play on the computer without a gamepad controller though, not a big deal."
"Quick review - Before you try this product, you can try the free 30 day trial from the ESET website or even from Amazon itself. I have been using since ESET 2013.

I put it on maximum settings on a system with - win 7 - 64 bit, 4GB Ram, 2.x Ghz, 300 GB 7,200 rpm hdd. I have had no performance issues. The customer support is good and prompt. ESET was blocking some important work related software and the customer support helped me to fix the problem. But it took a bit of trial and error though.

The main reason why I am malware free for 1+ year might be because of I surf safe websites, do not use any other people's thumb drives, use script blockers for Firefox (no script) and Google (ghostery) and above all, run browsers inside a sandbox when surfing potentially dangerous websites.

PS - I used Kaspersky Internet Security before this and it sucked. I did a review for that on Amazo."
Works perfectly!
Makes doing taxes easy.  This year's version even made all of that health care insurance and Obamacare nonsense easy to get through so that I could go on to file my taxes.
good
"A Nero 12 update installed AVG bloatware despite opting out of it. Created conflicts with AVG for searchs and anti-virus. One AV program is good, more is very bad; and unrelated to burining DVDs."
"I tried to get this application to run, but it didn't. I tried some suggestions found on the internet (there is no product support, unless you want to pay for it). I finally set it aside to attempt to get it to run another time. I'm glad I'm not in desperate need for this application."
"When Quickbooks initially launched they did not seem to be using - Acccountants, POS customers or the like - only programmers.  I have an unusual background.  My first degree is in Advanced Mgmt & Financial Acctg + a degree in computer programming.  I have owned or managed retail stores.  Working with this broad base of knowledge, when I was invited to be a Beta Tester for this product I jumped up for the opportunity.  I am more then satisfied.  I am a controller for a few small retail outlets and am recommending it as fit to use with the Quickbooks financial solutions software It is indeed compatible and great me as an accountant for year end, along with their tax software.  Bar none this is the best POS product which is indeed very compatible for the CPA or Enrolled Agent to work with.  I give a Thumbs up to this product."
This worked well for me.  It was nice to be able to read the book on a large screen instead of only on my Kindle.
now 14 is available...cannot be any better for 3d display..the best
"Apple has done a terrible job with this, and I have been a loyal .mac user for a number of years. No email for 5 days, and terrible customer support. You cannot email or phone, but you can wait an hour to Chat only to be told by someone that they don't know when service will be restored. For all the badmouthing AOL gets, that service has always been available and it is free!

Mac needs to get their head out of the sand with this one. But, don't buy into this product."
"BEWARE!  Does not include State returns, after buying this product this morning I found out that for the first time that I can remember Intuit actually shipped a ""TurboTax Deluxe"" product that does NOT include State Taxes.  And when I use the program to try to buy State Tax filing for California, they want an additional $39.99 on top of the $39.48 I had already paid for TurboTax to begin with.  Would have NEVER bought this edition if it had said in the title line that THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE STATE.

Had I bought the $43.82 TurboTax Deluxe 2015 Federal + State Taxes + Fed EFile Tax Preparation Software, I'd have everything I need.  Intuit should NOT offer a slightly (by $3.83) cheaper edition and deceptively ask an additional $40 when you realize you forgot to get TurboTax State.

(Also FYI, MOST people live in states  (43 out of 50) with an income tax of some kind, it's disingenuous to say, ""Well, this is the edition for those with no state tax"".  Some TPM at Intuit needs to be canned for this.)

As digital software downloads on Amazon.com are NOT returnable, now I'm out the money on this purchase as it's not going to get the job done.
I have to go back and buy TurboTax all over again with the State edition, as it comes out to be about the same price anyway.  But this time I'm going to get the physical product, as apparently I can't trust Intuit with digital downloads of their products any longer.

I've been using TurboTax for my income tax filing for 20 years now, VERY disappointed that they've pulled such a bait-and-switch.
Will be exploring alternate products that don't stick in hidden fees, I thought Intuit was better than this."
best
"Great product. Comes with all that I needed. Like it better than Roxio products. Once loaded in your computer, be sure to get latest updates via Nero control center."
"This product does the job but interface is poor.  Software is buggy in that it repeatedly ask for key previously entered.  May be Window 7 issue, not sure?"
"Very unhelpful customer service. We've been impacted by Turbotax breach issue. The customer service is been very unhelpful. We've been bounced around from one person to another. No one is been able to help us resolving the issue or guiding us how to deal with the issue.
My last option is to file a complaint with State Attorney General as a victim of breach."
Excellent product.
"My tech supports say it's faster and better. I have yet to see the difference, but, upgrading caused me a mountain of issues for many days, that no one forewarned me about. I lost several programs from my computer which I could not re-install as I no longer had the disk and a couple were from downloads and I never had the disk. I also lost two licenses which I purchased because I installed them the day prior to upgrading. One company was gracious enough to re-set my account after I provided the activation key and the other considered the license used and I had to purchase another license. As a student upgrading cost me a lot of time and aggravation. I suggest if you decided to upgrade do so when nothing is pressing for your computer submissions, and you purchase a bottle of headache reliver."
"I purchased the Intego Mac Premium Bundle a year ago, and they intentionally stopped it from working exactly 12 months later. I'd paid $45 for the software bundle, but 12 months later, Intego blocked its functionality and started claiming that it was a SUBSCRIPTION and that I must pay $79.99 for an additional 12 month of software usage. NOWHERE on this product's page, nor on the other bundle's page, does it list it as being a subscription product that would be functional for 12 months before requiring an additional payment (which, for me, was almost TWICE what I'd paid). Of course, this should be clearly identified on the product page, if not in the product's name/title.

Once I discovered this problem, I wrote Intego support, and they didn't relent at all. They claimed that it was common for such software programs to operate this way, though were unable to explain why, if that's the case, they don't clearly advertise and market this product as a 12-month subscription. I wrote back and forth several time and was told by ""Justin Fain, Director of Support Operations"" at Intego that, ""We do not provide open ended subscriptions for Intego software."" However, neither do they state for consumers on their product pages (not anywhere I can see at this writing, anyway) that these are products valid for only a limited duration. To me, this is fraudulent, and at least Amazon eventually gave me a refund for the product (though getting that refund was quite difficult).

Beware of Intego software until they clearly describe it for its limited timeframe of functionality."
"Not compatible with MAC's OSX even though it says it is. And according to the support website, they are not responsible blaming Apple for the problem."
"I bought this after reading all of the horrible reviews about Printmaster and all the glowing reviews about this product. I wanted to create things that I used to use Printmaster for. I wanted to make a calendar. Nope, no templates. I had to buy a Calendar creation program.  Then I wanted to make a printable birthday banner. Sorry, no template. I ended up going to Microsoft's website and downloading one for Word. The other reviewer was correct - you are always directed to the website so they can squeeze more money out of you as if spending $60 for this useless program wasn't enough. What a joke. I really do not understand why anyone would give this product a favorable review. I'll never buy another Serif product again."
good buy
just works
"We recently upgraded from the now obsolete and unsupported Peachtree Pro Accounting 2010 to the Sage 50 Complete Accounting 2013.  Our business simply needs bookkeeping vs. full-fledged accounting.  We don't get involved with more advanced features like check-printing or the ""Sage Connected Services"" of card processing, payroll or direct deposit.

The installation process was very simple, and we had no complications at all.  The recommended method to configure Windows Firewall automatically worked well.

I really like the Prior Period Account Reconciliation, so that we can reconcile bank accounts and access past transactions without switching accounting periods.

I also appreciate, as a user of a previous version, that the design of screens is familiar.  The layout remains grouped, e.g. ""Customer & Sales"", ""Vendors & Purchases"", etc.

The software functions similarly to the previous version, so it remains familiar.  This makes the transition much more comfortable.

If you're looking for an accounting software, this one will meet your business' needs.  If you're using an obsolete version of Sage Accounting software, don't hesitate to upgrade."
This has been a big time saver in keeping track of payments and invoicing!
"I have been using Quicken for 10 years or so now. I had to upgrade to 2014 so I can keep using the online updates . The only problem I have is that the Downloaded Transactions section at the bottom of the page opens up every time I go to a different account on my account bar. I minimize the section, but it comes back up when I change accounts again. Sometimes the downloaded transaction section takes up 1/2 the screen ! I cant figure out how to keep it minimized unless I TELL it to open !"
"A highly affective and engaging resource. Unfortunately, one may only use it once or twice with a particular group of students as the entries are very limited. Choices will repeat themselves by the second time around."
